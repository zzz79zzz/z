         Beta blockers are first-line therapy in the control of symptoms in patients with chronic stable angina, particularly effort-induced angina.

        <p>
         The major issues regarding the use of beta blockers in the medical management of the patient with stable angina and the evidence that these drugs are effective will be reviewed here. Their role, compared with other drugs, in the overall management of angina is discussed separately. (See

         The physiologic effects of catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) are mediated by activation of specific alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. There are at least three distinct types of beta receptors [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Beta-1, which are found primarily in heart muscle. Activation of these receptors results in increases in heart rate, contractility, and atrioventricular (AV) conduction, and a decrease in AV node refractoriness.
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Beta-2, which are present in heart muscle but are more prominent in bronchial and peripheral vascular smooth muscle. Activation of these receptors results in vasodilatation and bronchodilatation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Beta-3, which are found in adipose tissue and the heart. Activation of these receptors may mediate catecholamine-induced thermogenesis and may reduce cardiac contractility [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3

         Beta blockers act by competitively inhibiting catecholamines from binding to these receptors. Some are more selective for the beta-1 receptor. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cardioselectivity'

         Beta receptor density is a dynamic process that can change under varying physiologic conditions. In particular, chronic beta blocker therapy leads to an increase in receptor density [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. This can be clinically important, since sudden withdrawal of the beta blocker results in transient supersensitivity to catecholamines, possibly precipitating angina, myocardial infarction, or death [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. These complications can occur even in patients without previously apparent coronary disease [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. (See

         The beneficial therapeutic effects of beta blockade in patients with stable angina pectoris are mediated by a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. Myocardial oxygen demand varies directly with heart rate, contractility, and left ventricular wall stress, each of which is diminished by beta blockade. The decrease in wall stress is mediated in part by the antihypertensive action of these drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decline in heart rate is determined both by the degree to which the heart rate is sympathetically activated (as with exercise or stress) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ] and to the properties of the beta blocker. Those drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may actually increase the resting heart rate. They are, however, still effective in the treatment of angina because it is the reduction in the exercise heart rate that is of primary importance. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The negative inotropic effects of beta blockers may, at least theoretically, have a favorable impact on myocardial oxygen consumption in the patient with angina. In the past, beta blockers were avoided in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, from concern that negative inotropic effects could precipitate or worsen heart failure. However, extensive clinical experience and the results of major clinical trials have demonstrated that these agents actually prolong survival in patients with heart failure. In such patients, beta blocker therapy should be initiated at low dose, and volume overload should be corrected prior to the initiation of therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121086.html" rel="external">
          "Primary pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", section on 'Beta blocker'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Beta blockers may also affect coronary blood flow, although there are competing effects. Beta blockers inhibit adrenergically mediated coronary vasodilation, thereby increasing coronary vascular resistance and decreasing coronary blood flow [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, this potentially deleterious effect is overcome by the reductions in heart rate (which enhances coronary perfusion by prolonging diastole) and myocardial oxygen demand.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonselective beta blockers may exacerbate coronary vasospasm in patients with variant angina and should be avoided. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1481.html" rel="external">

         A number of different beta blockers are available for clinical use. Properties such as pharmacokinetics, cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and alpha adrenergic blocking activity are important characteristics that should be considered when choosing a particular agent.

         Although the beta blockers have similar pharmacotherapeutic effects, their pharmacokinetic properties differ significantly in ways that may influence their clinical usefulness and side effects [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Among individual drugs, there are differences in completeness of gastrointestinal absorption, amount of first-pass hepatic metabolism, lipid solubility, protein binding, extent of distribution in the body, penetration into the brain, concentration in the heart, rate of hepatic biotransformation, pharmacologic activity of metabolites, and renal clearance of the drug and its metabolites [
         <a href="#rid9">

         ].
        </p>

         On the basis of their pharmacokinetic properties, the beta blockers can be classified into two broad categories [

         ) are lipid-soluble, almost completely absorbed by the small intestine, and largely metabolized by the liver. They enter the central nervous system (CNS) in high concentrations, possibly resulting in an increased incidence of CNS side effects. They tend to have highly variable bioavailability and relatively short plasma half-lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, drugs in the second category (such as

         Cardioselectivity refers to the ability of a drug to preferentially block the beta-1 receptors. Nonselective beta blockers have equal affinity for the beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, while cardioselective agents will primarily inhibit the beta 1-receptors. Cardioselectivity is a relative property and substantial beta-2 receptor blockade can also occur at the higher doses that are often required to treat angina [

         Beta blockers are generally well tolerated in patients with stable angina, but have a well-recognized set of potential side effects that can limit their use. The major side effects of beta blockers are discussed fully elsewhere. (See

         Bronchoconstriction, due to beta-2 receptor blockade, can be induced by nonselective agents and high doses of cardioselective agents. As a result, many clinicians have assumed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma is a contraindication to beta blocker therapy. However, beta blockers are safe and effective in patients with mild COPD/asthma who are not taking a beta-2 adrenergic agonist. Furthermore, some patients carry a diagnosis of COPD that has not been confirmed. The data supporting these observations primarily come from studies of patients with an acute coronary syndrome and are discussed elsewhere. (See

         All of the beta blockers, regardless of pharmacologic properties, appear to be equally effective in the treatment of stable angina pectoris. They improve exercise capacity, reduce exercise-induced ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram, decrease the frequency of anginal episodes, and diminish the requirement for sublingual

         </span>
         The primary therapeutic goal of beta blockers in chronic stable angina is to reduce the frequency and severity of angina and to improve exercise capacity without significant side effects. As noted above, the efficacy of beta blockers in relieving angina is dose-dependent. It is therefore important to be certain that adequate beta blockade has been attained.
        </p>
        <p>
         With regard to the initiation of beta blocker therapy, we suggest starting at the lowest recommended dose for the chosen agent. Since the overall goal is a reduction in the frequency and severity of angina, it may not be necessary to titrate to high doses in some patients. Avoidance of high doses may decrease the likelihood of side effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reasonable goals when titrating the dose include:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Resting heart rate in the 60 to 70 beats/min range. Although we do not have a specific heart rate goal for exercise, relief of angina without causing dyspnea and fatigue from being overly beta blocked is a reasonable approach.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients with resting bradycardia prior to therapy can be treated with nitrates, or, if a beta blocker is necessary, a drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It is also reasonable to treat with a standard beta blocker in low doses and titrate according to resting and exercise heart rates.

         Given the general efficacy of most beta blockers in the management of stable angina, ancillary properties, such as dosing interval and cost, become important considerations when determining which beta blocker to use. We generally use a cardioselective agent (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/z/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">
          atenolol

          metoprolol
         </a>
         ). There are no major advantages of a nonselective agent, and there are potential disadvantages in patients with certain underlying diseases such as obstructive lung disease, asthma, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, and depression. Clearance of atenolol is dependent upon kidney functioning and active drug can accumulate in patients with renal impairment (CRCL &lt;35 mL/minute per 1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ). In general, we use metoprolol in patients with chronic kidney disease or unstable renal function because it is cleared by hepatic metabolism and does not need to be dose adjusted in renal impairment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are rarely used in the treatment of stable angina except possibly in patients with underlying resting bradycardia. They may not decrease heart rate and blood pressure at rest and should not be given to patients with a prior myocardial infarction or heart failure in whom beta blockade improves survival.
        </p>
        <p>
         We agree with the 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/American College of Physicians/American Association for Thoracic Surgery/Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions/Society of Thoracic Surgeons guideline on the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndrome, which reached the following conclusions on the role of beta blockers [

         Beta blockers are recommended as initial therapy for the relief of anginal symptoms in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. Calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates are recommended when beta blockers are contraindicated or poorly tolerated and in addition to beta blockers when angina persists with beta blocker monotherapy.

         Beta blockers are highly effective in the reduction of symptoms of angina and the development of myocardial ischemia in stable patients. However, they have never been shown to decrease mortality in these individuals in the absence of myocardial infarction or heart failure associated with a reduction in left ventricular systolic function. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy of beta blockers in stable angina'
         </a>
         above.)

         The physician should become familiar with one or two beta blockers in each class (eg,

         ) for cardioselective, nonselective, and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, respectively. The choice of agent depends upon the clinical setting since all beta blockers are equally effective in treating angina. (See

         Unless contraindicated, we treat most patients with stable angina pectoris with a beta blocker and generally as first-line antianginal therapy. (See

         For patients with ischemic heart disease, we suggest using a cardioselective agent, such as

          atenolol

          metoprolol

         , rather than a nonselective agent (
