Respiratory distress is typically characterized by signs of increased work of breathing, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and/or retractions [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Head bobbing, nasal flaring and grunting are additional signs more commonly seen in very young children. A respiratory rate that is inappropriately slow for the clinical condition may also be a sign of respiratory distress and may portent impending respiratory arrest. An abnormal pattern of respiration is a sign of respiratory distress that may offer clues to etiology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6463.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress in children: Emergency evaluation and initial stabilization", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>Respiratory distress may develop in children due to multiple etiologies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61637" href="/d/graphic/61637.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) that result from the following physiologic abnormalities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypoxemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5112.html" rel="external">"Control of ventilation", section on 'Hypoxic challenge'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypercarbia.

Neonates, infants, and young children are at particular risk given that they have higher oxygen consumption and less respiratory reserve. Children with inadequate respiratory effort (as can occur with fatigue, muscle weakness or CNS depression) can quickly develop significant physiologic compromise. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6310.html" rel="external">"Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations"</a>.)</p><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) refers to diffuse alveolar injury that results in impaired gas exchange, decreased pulmonary compliance and increased pulmonary artery pressure. It has a multitude of etiologies including pulmonary infection, gastric content aspiration, smoke inhalation, environmental toxins, drugs, alcohol, nonfatal drowning, sepsis, trauma, chemotherapeutic agents, immunosuppressants, and lung or stem cell transplant [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1609.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, children with respiratory distress secondary to disordered control of breathing or to pain, who do not have significant cardiopulmonary disease or trauma, usually improve with treatment of the primary condition and do not generally progress to respiratory failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13169095"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many conditions may cause acute respiratory distress in children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61637" href="/d/graphic/61637.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The underlying etiology, while commonly within the respiratory system, may also be within other systems, and the etiology may not be immediately obvious (eg, fever and rales may be due to heart failure as the result of myocarditis rather than pneumonia, which is more common). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13169102"><span class="h2">Immediately life-threatening conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any process that causes respiratory distress by compromising ventilation and/or oxygenation can be life-threatening. Imminently life-threatening conditions require early recognition and immediate, aggressive intervention.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13169109"><span class="h3">Severe upper airway obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with complete upper airway obstruction have no effective air movement, hence no audible speech, cry, or cough. They frequently assume a sniffing or tripod position in attempts to maintain their airway. Causes of complete upper airway obstruction include foreign body aspiration, angioedema from anaphylaxis, laryngospasm caused by hypocalcemia, and epiglottitis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62015" href="/d/graphic/62015.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Foreign body aspiration, anaphylaxis, and epiglottitis are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6455.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children", section on 'Causes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6080.html" rel="external">"Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/392.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Noisy inspiration (stridor) is a hallmark of severe partial upper airway obstruction although absence of stridor does not preclude significant partial airway obstruction, especially in a patient with depressed mental status. Common causes of severe partial upper airway obstruction include foreign body aspiration, infection (most commonly croup), and injury (such as airway thermal or chemical burns). Causes of acute upper airway obstruction that are commonly life-threatening are discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62015" href="/d/graphic/62015.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6455.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children", section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13169123"><span class="h3">Tension pneumothorax</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tension pneumothorax is an acutely life-threatening emergency that develops when increased intrathoracic volume from air that has leaked into the pleural cavity causes a shift of mediastinal structures toward the opposite side, compressing the contralateral lung and cardiac vessels. It is rapidly fatal without immediate decompression.</p><p>Tension pneumothorax is usually due to penetrating or blunt trauma, including mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation but it can also occur as the result of a spontaneous pneumothorax. Although tension usually develops immediately, it may be delayed for up to 24 hours, particularly if the pneumothorax is spontaneous and develops slowly.</p><p>Hallmarks of tension pneumothorax are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe respiratory distress</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Shift of mediastinal structures, including the trachea, toward the side contralateral to the collapsed lung</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ipsilateral hyperexpansion of the chest</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased or absent breath sounds and hyper-resonance to percussion on the ipsilateral side of the collapsed lung</p><p></p><p>In the rare patient with bilateral tension pneumothoraces, physical findings may be symmetric. Bedside ultrasound can rapidly confirm the diagnosis of pneumothorax. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6340.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous pneumothorax in children", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117242.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pneumothorax", section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Needle decompression is a potentially life-saving, temporizing measure that any physician should be able to perform. If immediately available, a thoracostomy tube or pigtail catheter can be placed in children with a tension pneumothorax without first performing needle thoracostomy only if the tube can be placed without delaying decompression; otherwise needle thoracostomy should be performed immediately, followed by chest tube or pigtail catheter placement as soon as possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126623.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Placement techniques and complications", section on 'Techniques'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126623.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Placement techniques and complications", section on 'Needle thoracostomy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13169137"><span class="h3">Pulmonary embolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that can cause respiratory distress. It is an uncommon condition in children and is often associated with the use of central venous lines or other vascular devices [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Other risk factors for PE include immobility, a hypercoagulable state (such as factor V Leiden mutation, protein S or protein C deficiency), congenital heart disease, trauma, surgery, nephrotic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hormone birth control, malignancy and complications of some chemotherapeutic regimens (such as L-asparaginase and steroids for acute lymphoblastic leukemia). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5918.html" rel="external">"Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18957925"><span class="h3">Cardiac tamponade</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cardiac tamponade occurs when blood, serous fluid, or air under tension fills the pericardial sack, resulting in life-threatening compromise of venous return and decreased stroke volume. Cardiac tamponade can present acutely with hypotension. Children may also have signs of respiratory distress or apnea [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. The classic signs of pericardial tamponade, referred to as Beck's triad (hypotension, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds), are present in less than one-third of patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Pulsus paradoxus (a drop in the systolic blood pressure of &gt;10 mmHg upon inspiration and, when severe, a weakening or disappearance of the peripheral pulse upon inspiration) is an indication for emergency pericardiocentesis in children with pericardial effusion. Bedside ultrasound can be used to rapidly identify fluid in the pericardial sac in patients with cardiac tamponade, and to guide pericardiocentesis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4936.html" rel="external">"Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4936.html" rel="external">"Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease", section on 'Measurement of pulsus paradoxus'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4936.html" rel="external">"Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease", section on 'Pulsus paradoxus in cardiac tamponade'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13823.html" rel="external">"Emergency pericardiocentesis"</a>.)</p><p>Acute cardiac tamponade is rare in children and is usually the result of trauma, particularly penetrating cardiac injury. It is rapidly fatal. In children, accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac is usually caused by infection, inflammation (most commonly collagen vascular disease), malignancy (eg, mediastinal lymphoma), or cardiac surgery (postpericardiotomy syndrome). Accumulation of pericardial fluid due to atraumatic etiology is usually insidious and less likely to progress to tamponade.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13169144"><span class="h3">Other traumatic conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade, several other traumatic conditions may cause respiratory distress including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flail chest</strong> – Flail chest occurs when multiple rib fractures result in a loss of stability of the chest wall. The flail segment retracts with inspiration and bulges with exhalation, resulting in inefficient expansion of the thorax, inefficient ventilation, and a significant increase in the energy expenditure for breathing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79746" href="/d/graphic/79746.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The mechanism of injury usually is direct impact. Flail chest is uncommon in children because the greater deformability of immature bone makes rib fractures less likely than in adults, and when present, is often associated with pulmonary contusion. Even without rib fractures, children may have significant pulmonary injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children", section on 'Flail chest'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary contusion</strong> – In children, pulmonary contusion occurs when traumatic force is applied to the chest wall and results in parenchymal damage with hemorrhage and edema. The initial presentation of children with pulmonary contusion is often dominated by clinical features associated with extrathoracic injuries. Nevertheless, pulmonary contusion should be suspected in any child with significant blunt force to the thorax, whether or not there are signs of respiratory distress or chest wall injury. Decreased breath sounds, rales, or rhonchi may be noted on physical examination. Chest radiography should be performed for all children with respiratory distress and may reveal pulmonary contusion. Further imaging with computed tomography (CT) is not indicated for pulmonary contusion unless tracheobronchial, diaphragmatic or vascular injury is suspected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6562.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary contusion in children", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6562.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary contusion in children", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pneumothorax</strong> – Pneumothorax occurs when air leaks from the lungs into the pleural space, resulting in collapse of the lung. It may be caused by blunt or penetrating trauma that creates air leak by directly damaging intrathoracic structures or indirectly due to increased intrathoracic pressure that ruptures respiratory structures. Ultrasound reveals echogenicity in the region of the uninflated lung. Ultrasound is more sensitive for diagnosis of pneumothorax than chest radiograph. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117242.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pneumothorax", section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Open pneumothorax</strong> – Pneumothorax due to a traumatic open chest wall wound occurs when ambient air enters the pleural space during inspiration through the chest wall defect (ie, a "sucking wound"). The air-filled space causes the lung within the injured hemithorax to collapse and shifts the mediastinum toward the unaffected hemithorax. During expiration, air exits the pleural space through the chest wall defect and the mediastinum swings back toward the injured hemithorax. Expiratory air from the normal lung (ie, "pendulum air") fills the collapsed lung. The "mediastinal flutter" may cause respiratory failure. Chest radiograph of an open pneumothorax is characterized by a visible chest wall defect and by massive expiratory mediastinal shift towards the injured side: this mediastinal behavior is different from tension pneumothorax where the expiratory shift of the mediastinum occurs towards the normal lung, resulting from air-trapping in the affected pleural space. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Treatment of open pneumothorax consists of immediately placing a sterile petroleum gauze over the open wound and taping on three sides to allow the dressing to act as a flutter valve that prevents air entry through the wound upon inspiration but allows air to escape during exhalation. A chest tube or pigtail catheter should be placed as soon as possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126623.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Placement techniques and complications", section on 'Techniques'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemothorax </strong>– In patients with massive hemothorax, respiratory distress results from the inability of the lung to expand on the affected side and from hemorrhagic shock. Thoracostomy tube placement and fluid resuscitation are key interventions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Breathing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Smoke inhalation </strong>– Smoke inhalation may cause respiratory distress due to thermal injury to the upper and lower airways, hypoxic gas inhalation, bronchopulmonary exposure to toxins with direct lung injury, and/or systemic toxicity from carbon monoxide and cyanide. Thermal injury to the upper airway is suggested by stridor, respiratory distress, facial burns, oropharyngeal blisters or edema, and carbonaceous sputum and warrants early endotracheal intubation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105477.html" rel="external">"Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants", section on 'General care'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105477.html" rel="external">"Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105477.html" rel="external">"Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants", section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Submersion injury </strong>– Children with nonfatal drowning, defined as a process resulting in primary respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in a liquid medium, may have hypoxemia (due to fluid aspiration or reflex laryngospasm) resulting in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary insufficiency can develop insidiously or rapidly. Findings include tachypnea, dyspnea, rales, and wheezing. Chest radiograph may be normal or show focal or diffuse pulmonary edema. Symptoms and radiographs may worsen dramatically within hours.

Spasmodic croup, also referred to as allergic croup is a noninfectious form of croup thought to be allergy mediated, given it is seen most often in patients with atopic disease.

Onset of spasmodic croup is abrupt, and symptoms are limited to barky cough. Barky cough, for infectious or spasmodic croup, most commonly begins during the night or with napping. Respiratory distress increases as upper airway obstruction becomes more severe. Rapid progression or signs of lower airway involvement suggests a more serious illness. Symptoms of viral croup typically persist for three to seven days with resolution of barky cough by day four in approximately 80 percent of children, with influenza and possibly SARS-CoV-2 causing more protracted illness than other viruses. Deviations from this expected course should prompt consideration of diagnoses other than laryngotracheitis. Spasmodic croup usually remits more quickly, sometimes within hours. Some children with severe or recurrent croup may have underlying airway abnormalities (eg, laryngomalacia, structural congenital airway abnormality, subglottic hemangioma, papillomatosis).

Patients with tracheitis may have rapid, dramatic and often transient decreases in oxygen saturation. In patients with respiratory failure due to upper airway infection, tracheitis is more common than epiglottitis or croup. The predominant clinical features of tracheitis are those of airway obstruction: stridor, cough, and respiratory distress accompanied by fever, highest in patients with bacterial or influenza as the etiology. Children younger than two to three years of age may be at increased risk for severe disease because of their relatively narrow airway diameter.

Neonates, infants, and young children are at particular risk because they have higher oxygen consumption and less respiratory reserve.

The inciting condition, while commonly within the respiratory system, may be due to a condition within other systems, and may not be immediately obvious (eg, fever and rales may be due to heart failure due to myocarditis rather than pneumonia, which is more common).
