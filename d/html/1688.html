MS is characterized pathologically by multifocal areas of demyelination with loss of oligodendrocytes and astroglial scarring. Axonal injury is also a prominent pathologic feature, especially in the later stages. Certain clinical features are typical of MS, but the disease has a highly variable pace and many atypical forms.</p><p>The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MS are reviewed here. Other aspects of MS are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96016.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis and epidemiology of multiple sclerosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96029.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, course, and prognosis of multiple sclerosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1689.html" rel="external">"Manifestations of multiple sclerosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1691.html" rel="external">"Management of clinically and radiologically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1698.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1687.html" rel="external">"Initial disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1686.html" rel="external">"Treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43337923"><span class="h1">WHEN TO SUSPECT MS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of MS should be suspected when the clinical presentation is suggestive of focal or multifocal demyelination involving the central nervous system.</p><p>The typical patient presents as a young adult with one or more clinically distinct episodes of central nervous system dysfunction such as optic neuritis, long tract symptoms/signs, a brainstem syndrome, or a spinal cord syndrome, followed by at least partial resolution. Symptoms usually develop over the course of hours to days and then gradually remit over the ensuing weeks to months, though remission may be incomplete. Presenting symptoms and signs may be either monofocal (consistent with a single lesion) or multifocal (consistent with more than one lesion).</p><p>While there are no clinical findings that are unique to MS, some are highly characteristic  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63940" href="/d/graphic/63940.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The diagnosis of MS is relatively straightforward for patients who present with symptoms and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and who have a relapsing-remitting course [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In some patients, clinically definite MS can be diagnosed at the time of a first attack, based upon the clinical, MRI, and/or cerebrospinal fluid findings, using the McDonald Criteria (see <a class="local">'McDonald diagnostic criteria'</a> below). Primary progressive MS refers to an MS presentation and course with insidious neurologic worsening and accumulation of disability, such as from spastic paraparesis or cerebellar ataxia. This pattern is observed in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients with MS.</p><p>Clinically isolated syndrome and radiologically isolated syndrome are related diagnostic situations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A clinically isolated syndrome refers to a monosymptomatic attack that does not fulfill diagnostic criteria for MS but may predispose to clinically definite MS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96029.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, course, and prognosis of multiple sclerosis in adults", section on 'Clinically isolated syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A radiographically isolated syndrome describes MRI brain lesions that are characteristic of MS but are found in patients who lack any symptoms of MS. The MRI lesions are often discovered incidentally in the diagnostic workup for other conditions (eg, headache or head injury). (See <a class="local">'Radiologically isolated syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2682842451"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of suspected MS begins with a detailed clinical history and examination. The clinical history should inquire specifically about the possibility of prior attacks with symptoms and evolution characteristic of an inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system. Unless otherwise contraindicated, all patients being evaluated for MS should have at least a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord without and with contrast [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Dedicated optic nerve MRI can be useful for diagnosis in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome, those with atypical clinical features (eg, atypical, isolated optic neuritis), and for exclusion of alternative diagnoses such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14089.html" rel="external">"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131838.html" rel="external">"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a typical presentation who have insufficient clinical and MRI evidence to confirm the diagnosis of MS by the McDonald criteria (see <a class="local">'McDonald diagnostic criteria'</a> below), additional testing with lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands (see <a class="local">'CSF analysis and oligoclonal bands'</a> below), visual evoked potentials (see <a class="local">'Evoked potentials'</a> below), and/or optical coherence tomography (see <a class="local">'Optical coherence tomography'</a> below) can be used to support the diagnosis, though optical coherence tomography is not part of the formal diagnostic criteria [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Of importance, these studies cannot be used to support optic nerve lesions in the absence of clear symptoms related to a current or historical attack.</p><p>For patients with an atypical history, examination, or MRI, additional testing with spine MRI, lumbar puncture, and/or autoantibody determination for aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies (see <a class="local">'Autoantibody testing'</a> below) is warranted to investigate alternatives in the differential diagnosis.</p><p>The neurological examination may reveal findings consistent with previous or current demyelinating events in the central nervous system, including optic neuritis (eg, relative afferent pupillary defect, color desaturation, visual loss), eye movement abnormalities (eg, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, pendular nystagmus), upper motor neuron signs (eg, spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign), ataxia, gait disturbance, hemisensory loss, or bilateral sensory loss and/or paresthesia in extremities due to a spinal cord lesion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the test of choice to support the clinical diagnosis of MS [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS include specific MRI requirements for the demonstration of lesion dissemination in space and time (see <a class="local">'McDonald diagnostic criteria'</a> below) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The diagnostic utility of MRI is high, with sensitivity and specificity of up to 87 and 73 percent, respectively, for the McDonald criteria requirement of dissemination in space [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. MRI detects many more MS lesions than computed tomography (CT), and it is able to detect MS demyelinating plaques in regions that are rarely abnormal on CT such as the brainstem  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119486" href="/d/graphic/119486.html" rel="external">image 1</a>), cerebellum, and spinal cord  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73197" href="/d/graphic/73197.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Most lesions seen on MRI correlate with pathologic lesions [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Lesion characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Focal MRI lesions suggestive of MS are typically found in specific white matter areas, such as the periventricular and juxtacortical regions, corpus callosum, infratentorial regions (particularly the pons and cerebellum) and the spinal cord (preferentially the cervical segment)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61864" href="/d/graphic/61864.html" rel="external">image 3</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. MS lesions (plaques) usually have an ovoid appearance.</p><p>Periventricular MS lesions are characteristically arranged at right angles to the corpus callosum as if radiating from this area; when viewed on sagittal images, they are referred to as Dawson fingers  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119485" href="/d/graphic/119485.html" rel="external">image 4</a>). The MS lesions appear hyperintense on proton density and T2-weighted studies. Many lesions, particularly in long-standing MS, are hypointense on T1-weighted images (so-called black holes); others are not visible at all.</p><p>Conventional T2-weighted MRI techniques may underestimate MS plaque size and thus overall plaque burden, particularly for cortical lesions. Advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy frequently reveal involvement of normal appearing white matter in patients with MS. However, due to the high frequency of nonspecific lesions on brain MRI, especially in patients with migraine or hypertension, there is a significant risk for false positive results [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Moreover, changes to the McDonald diagnostic criteria in 2017 seem to exacerbate this problem [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. As such, white matter hyperintensities are not by themselves diagnostic of MS and must be interpreted in the clinical context of the patient [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Spinal cord MRI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spinal cord MRI lesions are nearly as common as brain lesions in patients with MS [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>], though they are less likely to be clinically silent than brain lesions. In contrast, the frequency of abnormal signals on spinal cord MRI in normal individuals is only 2 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], since the non-MS-related hyperintense signal seen in older patients on cranial MRI does not occur in the spinal cord.</p><p>Spinal cord lesions typical of MS are associated with the following MRI characteristics [<a href="#rid12">12,14-17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Little or no cord swelling</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unequivocal hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequences that is visible in two planes (eg, axial and sagittal) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Size at least 3 mm but less than two vertebral segments in length</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occupy only part of the spinal cord in cross-section and are typically located in the dorsolateral part of the cord</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Focal (ie, clearly delineated and circumscribed on T2-weighted sequences)</p><p></p><p>Spinal cord MRI may increase the likelihood of finding dissemination of lesions in space and improve diagnostic sensitivity compared with brain MRI alone. The potential utility of spinal MRI in MS is illustrated by a study of 104 patients with early stage MS and low disability [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The diagnosis of MS was made by the 1982 criteria of Poser et al [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Abnormal cord MRI lesions were found in 83 percent, and these lesions were typically focal; focal cord lesions were usually multiple (median 3), small (median 0.8 vertebral segments), and located most often in the cervical cord (56 percent). Diffuse lesions were found in 13 percent, usually in conjunction with focal lesions. In this cohort of patients, the addition of spinal cord to brain MRI lesions, compared with brain MRI alone, increased the diagnostic sensitivity of the original 2001 McDonald criteria [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] from 66 to 85 percent.</p><p>Longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions, particularly those that exceed three spinal segments and mainly involve the central cord on axial MRI sections, are suggestive of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMO spectrum disease. (See <a class="local">'NMOSD'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Active versus chronic lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute MS lesions tend to be larger than chronic lesions on MRI and have somewhat ill-defined margins. As they resolve, they become smaller with sharper margins. This presumably reflects reduction of edema and inflammation present at the time of acute plaque formation, leaving only residual areas of demyelination, gliosis, and enlarged extracellular space with remission. The MRI appearance of primary progressive MS shows a smaller total disease burden, a greater preponderance of small lesions, fewer gadolinium-enhancing new lesions, and acquisition of fewer lesions per unit time than the secondary progressive form of MS [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), a paramagnetic contrast agent that can cross only disrupted blood-brain barriers, is useful to assess for active lesions [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Gadolinium increases signal intensity on T1-weighted images  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119487" href="/d/graphic/119487.html" rel="external">image 5</a>). It is not completely clear if inflammation is the triggering event that causes demyelination and axonal degeneration, but gadolinium enhancement diminishes or disappears after treatment with glucocorticoids, a therapy thought to restore integrity of the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Gadolinium-enhancing lesions on T1-weighted MRI often correspond to areas of high signal on T2-weighted and low signal intensity on unenhanced T1-weighted images, probably due to edema  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61864" href="/d/graphic/61864.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). The importance of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in MS is related to the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The accumulation of gadolinium in plaques is associated with new or newly active plaques and with pathologically confirmed acute inflammation in MS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The majority of gadolinium-enhancing plaques are clinically asymptomatic, although the presence of ongoing enhancing plaques suggests continuing disease activity that likely contributes to cumulative pathophysiology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gadolinium enhancement is a transient phenomenon and usually disappears after a few weeks, but it may rarely persist for up to eight weeks in acute plaques. One study found that the average duration of enhancement was three weeks and the median was two weeks [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Prolonged persistence of enhancement should caution against the diagnosis of MS [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that the presence of active lesions on serial MRI scans carries a high risk of continuous disease activity [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p></p><p>Gadolinium enhancement patterns may provide some clues to the underlying pathology of lesions. MS lesions typically are ring-enhancing (closed or open ring) or nodular, and occur in the brain more often than in the spinal cord [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Other patterns may suggest alternative diagnosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large or multiple closed-ring enhancement may be seen in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (see <a class="local">'ADEM'</a> below), malignancy, or infection. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Meningeal and/or nerve root enhancement suggests neurosarcoidosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The trident sign (ie, spinal cord linear dorsal subpial enhancement accompanied by central cord/canal enhancement in a "trident" pattern [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]) also suggests neurosarcoidosis </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Punctate or miliary enhancement may occur with chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) (see <a class="local">'CLIPPERS'</a> below), vasculitis, progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML), or Susac syndrome </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Band-like enhancement is suggestive of Baló concentric sclerosis (see <a class="local">'Tumefactive demyelination'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cloud-like enhancement of lesions with blurred margins in the corpus callosum [<a href="#rid27">27</a>] may be seen in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (see <a class="local">'NMOSD'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Flat pancake-like enhancement [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] may be seen in cervical spinal cord spondylotic myelopathy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Purely cortical enhancement is concerning for vasculitis or ischemic lesion</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistence of enhancement for more than three months is worrisome for malignancy</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Black holes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most MS lesions are isointense to white matter on T1-weighted MRI, but some are hypointense or appear as "black holes" [<a href="#rid29">29-32</a>], particularly in the supratentorial region  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61864" href="/d/graphic/61864.html" rel="external">image 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119488" href="/d/graphic/119488.html" rel="external">image 6</a>). These hypointense lesions are nonspecific at a given time point, as nearly half will revert to normal in a few months. The disappearance of a black hole is most likely due to remyelination and resolution of edema [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Although the evidence is limited, persistent black holes are thought to be markers of severe demyelination and axonal loss [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The pathological substrate for the accumulation of persisting black holes appears to be predominantly axonal damage [<a href="#rid29">29,30,33</a>], as shown in a postmortem histopathology-MRI correlation study [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Such focal axonal loss most likely contributes to Wallerian degeneration.

These patients do not have MS. Compression of the cervical cord by intervertebral disc disease is often an issue in middle-aged patients, since a majority has some degree of disc disease. There is little doubt that some laminectomies have been carried out for cervical spondylosis where MS was the final correct diagnosis.

Nevertheless, a single demyelinating lesion can produce a progressive myelopathy similar to primary progressive MS, a condition termed progressive solitary sclerosis. A case series described 30 patients who developed progressive motor impairment attributable to a single demyelinating lesion on MRI [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. The progressive impairments in this group were hemiparesis/monoparesis (n = 24), quadriparesis (n = 5), and paraparesis (n = 1). These deficits were attributed to solitary demyelinating lesions identified by MRI in the cervical spinal cord (n = 18), cervicomedullary junction and brainstem region (n = 6), thoracic spinal cord (n = 4), and subcortical white matter (n = 2). With a median follow-up from symptom onset of 100 months, none had clinical symptoms suggestive of relapses affecting other portions of the central nervous system, and no new lesions were found in the patients who had repeat MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord. Oligoclonal bands or an elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) index were present in 13 of 26 (50 percent) patients. There was no evidence suggesting another etiology for progressive myelopathy, such as NMO.

The McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117578" href="/d/graphic/117578.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) apply primarily to patients who have a typical clinically isolated syndrome at presentation suggestive of relapsing-remitting MS, and can also be applied to patients presenting with insidious neurologic progression suggestive of primary progressive MS. While useful when the diagnosis of MS is clinically suspected, the McDonald criteria are <strong>not</strong> intended for distinguishing MS from other neurologic conditions. The core requirement of the diagnosis of MS is the objective demonstration of dissemination of central nervous system lesions in both space  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117898" href="/d/graphic/117898.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) and time  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117899" href="/d/graphic/117899.html" rel="external">table 6</a>), based upon clinical findings alone, a combination of clinical and MRI findings, or in some instances an appropriate clinical syndrome and highly supportive MRI data.
