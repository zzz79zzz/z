While the cause may be evident after history-taking, often no etiology is immediately apparent. In such cases, clinicians face the challenge of pursuing a thoughtful, cost-effective yet comprehensive diagnostic strategy.</p><p>The evaluation of the patient with night sweats or generalized hyperhidrosis is discussed here. The management of benign excessive sweating limited to certain areas of the body (primary focal hyperhidrosis) is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5567.html" rel="external">"Primary focal hyperhidrosis"</a>.)</p><p>Although hot flashes and flushing are discussed here as they relate to the diagnostic evaluation of night sweats, they are reviewed in greater detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7390.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hot flashes", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7395.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause", section on 'Hot flashes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2782.html" rel="external">"Approach to flushing in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive sweating, or generalized hyperhidrosis, is the secretion of sweat in excess of that needed to control body temperature. It may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (due to an underlying cause). When sweating is limited to certain areas of the body, it is called primary focal hyperhidrosis; this is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5567.html" rel="external">"Primary focal hyperhidrosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Night sweats (sleep hyperhidrosis) are episodes of generalized hyperhidrosis that occur during sleep and may range in severity from moderate diffuse sweating to drenching sweats that require changing bedclothes and even bed sheets. An overheated room or too many bed coverings may be a simple cause for an increase in sweating at night, but sweating in these circumstances does not necessarily represent sleep hyperhidrosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hot flashes may be difficult to distinguish from night sweats, although the former have several distinctive features. Hot flashes may begin with an unpleasant heat sensation in the chest, neck, or abdomen. A sudden warmth and visible skin redness in the chest, head, and neck follows, which may be visible to observers [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The sensation of warmth lasts for three to four minutes and is typically followed by sweating in the same areas. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7390.html" rel="external">"Menopausal hot flashes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Flushing, an increased cutaneous blood flow due to vasodilation, is experienced as a warmth and redness of the face and occasionally the trunk, which may be associated with sweating. It sometimes may be difficult to distinguish flushing with increased sweating from sweating due to hot flashes or night sweats. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2782.html" rel="external">"Approach to flushing in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are limited high-quality data on the incidence of night sweats; only a few small series describe these patients and their ultimate diagnoses [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of over 2000 patients presenting to primary care clinicians, 41 percent reported experiencing night sweats within the last month; 23 percent had night sweats only and 18 percent experienced both day and night sweats [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a random sample of 174 hospital inpatients, 32 percent of non-obstetric patients and 60 percent of obstetric patients reported night sweats within the prior three months [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a cross-sectional study of 360 patients visiting a primary care clinic, 24 percent of patients experienced night sweats in the previous month and half of these reported severe (drenching) sweats [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a large cross-sectional population analysis, 4 percent of 4680 persons living in Bangkok, Thailand reported night sweats [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p>The presence of night sweats does not necessarily portend a poor prognosis or risk of increased mortality. As an example, in one study of 1500 older adults, those reporting night sweats at baseline were no more likely to die over the next seven years than those without night sweats [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. While this does not diminish the importance of a careful evaluation of patients with night sweats, it does suggest that most patients with night sweats may have a benign course.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2819300867"><span class="h1">INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF ALL PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the myriad possible causes of night sweats and conditions (hot flashes, generalized hyperhidrosis, and flushing) that may present with nighttime sweating symptoms, the challenge is to correctly identify those patients with a serious underlying cause while minimizing unnecessary diagnostic testing.</p><p>There are no high-quality data to guide the diagnostic evaluation to generalized hyperhidrosis and night sweats, and reasonable clinicians may have different approaches. Our approach is based upon our clinical experience, taking into account the likelihood of certain conditions in a primary care setting, the diagnostic value of a careful history and physical examination, and the tradeoff between delay of diagnosis with a conservative approach versus the cost and risk of diagnostic testing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2832702266"><span class="h2">Elements of the medical history to ascertain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed medical history is the most important element in the evaluation of a patient with generalized hyperhidrosis or night sweats  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126152" href="/z/d/graphic/126152.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Characteristics of the sweating</strong> – The exact details of the sweating episodes are essential to clarify and include the severity and frequency of the events. Mild sweats are typically less concerning for underlying serious disease or infection than are drenching night sweats that cause the patient to change their bedclothes and sheets. In addition, the frequency of sweats, including daytime symptoms, should be determined. As an example, night sweats occurring every night versus once monthly raise more concern for a serious underlying cause.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fevers</strong> – Fever should be excluded with certainty when evaluating a patient with night sweats; if there is any concern for concurrent fever, patients should take and record daily temperatures during and after sweating episodes and at other random times (once to twice daily). When a documented fever occurs in association with night sweats, infection and malignancy become more likely diagnostic possibilities. Additionally, if fevers are present, the patient should be questioned about rigors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors for tuberculosis</strong> – The patient should be evaluated for risk factors for tuberculosis (TB); including a prior positive TB skin test or interferon-gamma release assay, HIV infection, hemodialysis, gastrectomy, solid organ transplantation, exposure to an individual with TB, being homeless or living in an institutionalized setting, immigration from an endemic area, working in a health care setting, or symptoms of active TB [cough, sputum, fatigue, and weight loss]). (See <a class="local">'Infections'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, or known history of malignancy</strong> – We ask about unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and pruritus, which may suggest the presence of a malignancy such as lymphoma. In addition, we inquire about any known history of malignancy, or the presence of enlarged lymph nodes; if any of these are present, a diagnosis of malignancy is also suspected. (See <a class="local">'Malignancies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors for HIV infection</strong> – We also ask about risk factors for HIV infection, including injection drug use, men who have sex with men, sexual activity with multiple partners, or commercial sex work. Other relevant medical history includes thrush, diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, or a report of enlarged lymph nodes. (See <a class="local">'Infections'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess for bacterial infection</strong> – We assess for likelihood of bacterial infection, including the patient's risk factors for bacteremia (eg, chronic indwelling vascular catheter, injection drug use, prior history of endocarditis, recent dental work with risk factors for endocarditis, immunosuppression). We ask about any localized pain, especially back or joint pain, which (particularly if accompanied by fever) might suggest endocarditis, bacteremia, or spinal infection including vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis. (See <a class="local">'Infections'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Geographic infection risk</strong> – We assess the patient's geographic region of residence and also inquire about travel history. Specifically, we consider residence in or any recent travel to areas where certain infections such as malaria, typhoid fever, and tick-borne diseases are endemic. While fever and other symptoms are often present with these infections, night sweats may be the first clinical feature. We ask about known or suspected mosquito or tick bites, food and water hygiene, use of chemoprophylaxis for malaria (if indicated), and country-specific vaccination status. We ask about residence in the Southwest of the United States, particularly Arizona and the San Joaquin Valley of California, and travel to Mexico and parts of Central and South America, due to the risk of coccidioidomycosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3888.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of fever in the returning traveler"</a> and <a class="local">'Infections'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2460.html" rel="external">"Primary pulmonary coccidioidal infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>COVID-19 exposure</strong> – In the pandemic era, nearly all patients around the globe live in countries where person-to-person transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potential risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition, risk exists for close-range contact (&lt;2 meters) with a person of unknown COVID-19 status for a cumulative total of at least 15 minutes in a 24-hour period [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Risk is increased for household contacts of patients with known COVID-19, for health care workers who may be exposed to COVID-19 patients and who do not follow proper personal protective equipment precautions, for first responders, and for others with regular exposure to members of the community such as pharmacy technicians and grocery store clerks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Transmission'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hormonal (estrogen and androgen) status</strong> – For female patients, we consider age and menopausal (surgical, chemical or natural) status. We also inquire about the use of estrogen-containing products and recent obstetric history. For male patients, any history of androgen deprivation therapy (chemical or surgical) is assessed and, if relevant, the temporal relationship to the onset of sweats. (See <a class="local">'Endocrine causes'</a> below and <a class="local">'Medications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other endocrine symptoms</strong> – We question the patient about episodic flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, palpitations, or headache which might suggest a neuroendocrine etiology. In addition, weight loss in association with heat intolerance and tremor may suggest hyperthyroidism. (See <a class="local">'Endocrine causes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medication use</strong> – Medication history should include both prescription and over-the-counter supplements; a temporal relationship between initiation of a new medication known to be associated with generalized hyperhidrosis and the onset of symptoms increases the likelihood of the medication as the cause  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122127" href="/z/d/graphic/122127.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Medications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurologic history</strong> – We evaluate for a history of a spinal cord injury, stroke, or other neurologic disorder which may be associated with autonomic dysreflexia. (See <a class="local">'Neurologic causes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1485586059"><span class="h2">Focused physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the medical history is the cornerstone of the clinical evaluation of patients with night sweats, a focused physical examination may provide additional diagnostic information  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126152" href="/z/d/graphic/126152.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General appearance; observe overall health including nutritional status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and weight.

The most common precipitant of acute episodes is bladder distension; it may also occur after rectal distension, urologic or rectal procedures, or any painful stimuli [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Common clinical features include sweating of the forehead or generalized sweating along with headache, gooseflesh, cutaneous vasodilation, increased muscle spasticity, an acute rise in blood pressure, and a desire to void. This distinctive symptom constellation in the context of a patient with a spinal cord injury is not easily confused with other causes of sweating spells [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

In a series of patients in a primary care practice reporting night sweats, symptoms positively associated with sweating included daytime tiredness (odds ratio [OR] 1.99, CI 1.12-3.53) and legs jerking during sleep (OR 1.78, CI 1.05-3.00) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

In a study evaluating night sweats in patients with diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), approximately 33 percent of patients reported having night sweats at least three times a week; with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, the percentage reporting night sweats decreased to 12 percent [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. In a report from Thailand, 14.4 percent of a population sample that reported habitual snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness also reported night sweats [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

It may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (due to an underlying cause). When sweating is limited to certain areas of the body, it is called primary focal hyperhidrosis. Night sweats are episodes of generalized hyperhidrosis that occur during sleep and may range in severity from moderate diffuse sweating to drenching sweats that require changing bedclothes and even bed sheets. Hot flashes and flushing with associated sweating may be difficult to distinguish from generalized hyperhidrosis and night sweats. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical history</strong> – A detailed medical history is the most important element in the evaluation for all patients with generalized hyperhidrosis or night sweats  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126152" href="/z/d/graphic/126152.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Elements of the medical history to ascertain'</a> above).

In this case, evaluation for fever of unknown origin should be pursued  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef126174" href="/z/d/graphic/126174.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).
