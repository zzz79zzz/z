         Treatment of patients with lung cancer depends upon the tumor stage, histology (non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] versus small cell lung cancer, nonsquamous versus squamous NSCLC), molecular characteristics, and an assessment of the patient's overall medical condition. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4639.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the initial treatment and prognosis of lung cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients without a driver mutation, initial systemic treatment generally consists of immunotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or their combination, depending on the tumor's expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 and histology. Maintenance treatment, using components of the initial regimen or another noncross-resistant agent, is often included as part of the treatment and continued until progressive disease develops or toxicity requires cessation of therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite advances in the initial treatment of advanced NSCLC, trials suggest that the median time to progression on initial chemoimmunotherapy is on the order of six to ten months. This topic will review appropriate next line therapy in patients whose cancers lack a targetable driver mutation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The issues surrounding the indications and choice of the initial chemotherapy and immunotherapy, or targeted therapy (if appropriate), are discussed elsewhere:

         If progression on a PD-1 axis inhibitor after initial response is limited to one or two sites ("oligoprogression"), local therapy to the site(s) of progression (ie, radiation, thermal ablation, or surgery) with continuation of systemic therapy with the PD-1 axis inhibitor may represent an alternative to salvage systemic therapy, recognizing that data supporting this approach are limited. In a retrospective analysis of 26 patients with acquired resistance to PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy, 88 percent had recurrence limited to one or two sites [

In a secondary analysis, pemetrexed was less effective in patients with squamous carcinomas [

         In general, patients who have progressed after one chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy regimen are treated with a noncross-resistant regimen. However, for patients who have responded to an initial regimen and are stable for at least six months after discontinuation, we offer retreatment with the same regimen upon progression, particularly for those with a good performance status. Given limited data with this approach, however, others may reasonably opt instead to proceed with the next line of treatment. Moreover, the potential for cumulative toxicity should be taken into account if retreatment is being considered, as typically tolerance for a given regimen decreases with increased exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a retrospective study of 66 patients with response to first-line therapy, 28 patients were retreated with the same regimen upon progression and 38 were treated with

The median interval from the end of first-line chemotherapy to relapse was five months. The overall response rate among those being retreated was 29 percent versus 8 percent among those receiving docetaxel. The median survival from the beginning of retreatment was 17 months versus 9 months among those receiving docetaxel.

          Tumor Treating Fields
         </strong>
         – Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are electric fields that are delivered locoregionally and noninvasively to the tumor site via two pairs of arrays placed on the skin of the patient's thorax. In a randomized trial in patients with progression on previous platinum-based chemotherapy, use of TTFields in addition to standard systemic therapy improved overall survival relative to systemic therapy alone (13.2 versus 9.9 months; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98), but increased the rate of serious adverse events (53 versus 38 percent) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Several features limit the broad application of findings from this trial. Benefit observed was limited to the subset of patients who received TTFields with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in the second-line; benefit was not observed in those who received TTFields combined with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. However, in contemporary practice, immunotherapy is typically included in first-line treatment and not deferred as later line monotherapy. Moreover, application of TTFields is cumbersome, requiring wearing an apparatus and carrying a battery pack for the majority of the day, making it unappealing or not feasible for many patients.

         The general strategy of choosing a systemic agent for the fit, older patient is the same as for younger patients, and advanced age alone should not preclude receipt of therapy.

         Many patients who receive definitive therapy, which often includes adjuvant chemotherapy, eventually relapse. Defining the appropriate treatment strategy, including the possible readministration of drugs used in the adjuvant regimen and the use of noncross-resistant regimens, has become an important issue [

         If relapse occurs more than 12 months after the completion of adjuvant therapy or definitive chemoradiation, patients are typically managed as patients with chemotherapy-naϊve, first-line NSCLC. (See

         If relapse occurs between 6 and 12 months after adjuvant chemotherapy or definitive chemoradiation, the decision is individualized based on patient and provider preferences, taking into account the current extent of disease and the patient's performance status. For example, a patient with a good performance status and a large burden of disease may have a window of opportunity to experience benefit from retreatment, particularly if the magnitude of response to initial treatment was large.

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Despite advances in the initial treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), trials suggest that the median time to progression on initial chemoimmunotherapy is on the order of six to ten months. The treatment upon progression depends upon the initial treatment strategy, as well as on patient and disease factors. (See

          Patients initially treated with immunotherapy only

         – For most patients who have experienced progression on checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, we suggest a platinum based doublet (

          Grade 2C

         <strong>
          Special considerations for older adults
         </strong>
         – The general strategy of choosing a systemic agent for the fit, older patient is the same as for younger patients, and advanced age alone should not preclude receipt of therapy. However, the presence of comorbidities may influence choice of treatment. The approach to older patients with NSCLC is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         have a slightly higher response rate but inconsistent survival benefits compared with carboplatin-based regimens. For the majority of patients who will receive a chemotherapy doublet, we suggest using a carboplatin-based regimen (
