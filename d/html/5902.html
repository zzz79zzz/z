The symptoms may be caused by many pathologic states involving several systems (including gastrointestinal, neurologic, endocrine, renal, and psychiatric). Younger children may not be able to describe nausea, which may further complicate diagnosis. The diagnostic process is guided by the medical history and clinical features of specific disorders and their relative frequency among children in different age groups.</p><p>Vomiting and nausea may occur together or separately and may not be perceived at the same level of intensity. As an example, vomiting can occur without preceding nausea in individuals with mass lesions in the brain or increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Furthermore, some medications may alleviate vomiting but not the accompanying nausea.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the causes of nausea and vomiting and a general approach to diagnosis and management. Individual disorders are discussed in further detail in linked topic reviews. These include several gastrointestinal disorders that present with both abdominal pain and nausea or vomiting. Evaluation of the child in whom abdominal pain is the primary presenting complaint is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6434.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111.html" rel="external">"Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H113391611"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vomiting</strong> (emesis) refers to the forceful oral expulsion of gastric contents associated with coordinated contraction of the abdominal and chest wall musculature. Vomitus often has a slight yellow tinge, which is caused by reflux of small amounts of bile into the stomach. Vomitus is considered bilious if it has a green or bright yellow color, indicating larger amounts of bile in the stomach; bilious vomiting is often associated with intestinal obstruction, as described below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nausea</strong> generally refers to an unmistakable sensation of unpleasantness that may precede vomiting but may be present even in a child who does not vomit. It is often associated with autonomic changes such as salivation, increased heart and respiratory rates, and a reduction in gastric tone and mucosal blood flow [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p>The related terms regurgitation, anorexia, sitophobia, early satiety, retching, and rumination are defined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55952" href="/d/graphic/55952.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PHYSIOLOGY OF EMESIS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurophysiology</strong> – Vomiting may have a physiologic benefit since it provides a means to expel potential toxins. Nausea and vomiting may also induce a conditioned aversion to ingested toxins [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In disease states, however, vomiting pathways are activated inappropriately. The major pathways through which nausea and vomiting are induced are vagal afferents, the area postrema, the vestibular system, and the amygdala [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Five principal neurotransmitter receptors mediate vomiting: muscarinic (M1), dopamine (D2), histamine (H1), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 3 [5-HT<sub>3</sub>]), and substance P (neurokinin 1 [NK1]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2538.html" rel="external">"Characteristics of antiemetic drugs"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Vagal afferent pathway – Abdominal vagal afferents are involved in the emetic response. These pathways can be evoked by either mechanical or chemosensory sensations. Examples of sensations that trigger this pathway include overdistension, food poisoning, mucosal irritation, cytotoxic drugs, and radiation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Vagal afferents are an important site of action of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists used as antiemetic drugs [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Area postrema – The area postrema has been referred to as the "chemoreceptor trigger zone." Anatomically, this region is located at the caudal extremity of the floor of the fourth ventricle. Because the area postrema represents a relatively permeable blood-brain barrier region, it is the place where many, but not all, systemic chemicals act to induce emesis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The area postrema is an important site for M1, D2, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and NK1 receptors, each of which is a key mediator of vomiting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Vestibular system – The vestibular system is involved in the emetic response to motion. This response is often exacerbated when vestibular input is in conflict with visual sensations [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Irritation or labyrinthine inflammation can produce vomiting. Others have suggested that overstimulation of the vestibular system is not a complete explanation for motion sickness and that circulating neuroactive compounds may be involved. H1 receptors in the vestibular nucleus have a role in this response.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Amygdala – The amygdala is involved in a variety of stress and emotional responses. Among other structures, it receives input from the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex and sends impulses to the hypothalamus. Aberrant activation of the amygdala may lead to a sensation of nausea.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Somatomotor events</strong> – The act of vomiting represents a highly coordinated sequence of events. As noted above, vomiting describes the act of emptying out the stomach, characterized by cycles of retching followed by the forceful expulsion of gastric contents. The detailed sequence of events is as follows [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The diaphragm descends and the intercostal muscles contract while the glottis is closed</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The abdominal muscles contract and the gastric contents are forced into the upper gastric vault and lower esophagus</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The abdominal muscle relaxes and the esophageal refluxate empties back into the gastric vault</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Several cycles of retching, each more rhythmical and forceful in nature, occur, with shorter intervals in between</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abdominal contraction associated with elevation of diaphragm results in forceful expulsion of gastric contents</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H102891044"><span class="h1">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with acute vomiting, typically for hours to a few days, most often present to an emergency department, whereas patients with chronic symptoms are more often initially evaluated in outpatient office settings. In both urgent care and routine outpatient settings, the following steps should generally be undertaken in patients with nausea and vomiting:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify concerning signs and symptoms that suggest a serious cause of vomiting that requires urgent treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100349" href="/d/graphic/100349.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). For example, emergency department clinicians should expeditiously exclude life-threatening disorders such as bowel obstruction, diabetic ketoacidosis, adrenal crisis, toxic ingestion, or increased intracranial pressure (ICP). (See <a class="local">'Concerning signs'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine the etiology if possible. The differential diagnosis is determined, in part, by the child's age and whether the nausea and vomiting are acute, chronic, or episodic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treat as appropriate for the cause and severity of vomiting:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Identify and correct the consequences or complications of nausea and vomiting (eg, fluid depletion, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Provide targeted therapy when possible, such as nonoperative reduction for intussusception, surgery for bowel obstruction or appendicitis, or insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Provide supportive care and treatment to relieve symptoms (see <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H102891119"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A careful history and physical examination should be performed. In many cases, the cause of the nausea and vomiting can be determined from the history and physical examination and additional testing is not required. The urgency of pursuing a diagnostic evaluation depends on the duration of illness, overall clinical status of the patient (especially hydration, circulatory, and neurologic status), and associated findings.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H102891175"><span class="h2">Concerning signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Warning signs that may indicate a serious cause of vomiting include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100349" href="/d/graphic/100349.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonspecific:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prolonged vomiting</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Profound lethargy</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant weight loss</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastrointestinal obstruction or disease:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bilious vomiting</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Projectile vomiting in a young infant &lt;12 weeks of age</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hematemesis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hematochezia (rectal bleeding)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Marked abdominal distension and tenderness</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurologic or systemic disease:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bulging fontanelle in a neonate or young infant</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Headache, positional triggers for vomiting or vomiting on awakening, and/or lack of nausea</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Altered consciousness, seizures, or focal neurologic abnormalities</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of head trauma</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypotension disproportionate to the apparent illness and/or hyponatremia and hyperkalemia</p><p></p><p>Patients should be referred to an appropriate specialist (eg, pediatric gastroenterologist, pediatric surgeon, neurologist) depending on the suspected cause.

This possibility is supported by a history of close contacts with vomiting and/or diarrhea and suggests gastroenteritis. However, more serious causes of these symptoms should be considered in patients with atypical features. These causes include infection (sepsis, infectious enteritis/colitis), appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Hirschsprung disease-associated enterocolitis (especially in neonates or infants with predisposition, such as trisomy 21).
