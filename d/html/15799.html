In the United States and Europe, the risk of HIV transmission from mother to infant has declined to historically low levels with the use of antiretroviral medications [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Contributions to this successful prevention effort include universal testing of pregnant women for HIV infection, life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) administration to all individuals infected with HIV including pregnant women, the use of cesarean delivery (when appropriate), and appropriate infant antiretroviral prophylaxis management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13972.html" rel="external">"Prenatal evaluation of women with HIV in resource-rich settings"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will address ART in the pregnant woman with HIV in resource-rich settings. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services publishes guidelines on the evaluation and management of pregnant women with HIV, which are updated on an ongoing basis as safety and efficacy data in pregnancy become available [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Our recommendations below are consistent with these guidelines. </p><p>We recognize that not all pregnant, postpartum, and lactating individuals identify as women or mothers. Using gender-inclusive language, however, is not possible in all languages and all countries and for all our readers. The topics discussed here are based on risks driven by biological sex and not gender identify. Therefore, throughout this topic, we use the term “woman” to signify a person of the female sex (regardless of gender identity) and the term “mother” to signify the female biological parent of a child (regardless of gender identity).</p><p>Other guidelines that are relevant to resource-rich settings include those from the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acog.org%2Fclinical%2Fclinical-guidance%2Fcommittee-opinion%2Farticles%2F2018%2F09%2Flabor-and-delivery-management-of-women-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus-infection%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DEstablished%2520and%2520ongoing%2520research%2520has%2520shown%2520that%2520treatment%2520of%2520human%2Cbe%2520sustained%252C%2520independent%2520of%2520the&amp;token=7cWef4Iy7ksl7aiIBCs%2Ff5qR5dcLUce4OAfDRVj%2F0qIDtI6RR19iO0OB8qJyWNh2EjSsIkhAFnLrq4E0c5TTBlVxGADb6QGWzzJhiiAFRvCxD4njaHVOYowdFNOStkngzvVPnmb1GGzZi9VNgMfoiG%2BZBKPz8cKhg3FJVpU%2Fmmq%2BxAqalp%2FjKvPb1P3JuGV1M7HqMr6Op%2FadCZg0%2Bf04wXiLyp1cP9GU3DyElbBJIU17WgYjNxi4D4i7vkqmdKAN4OU%2FF2jJzuY%2FwGU%2BWO2Gm68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15799" target="_blank">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhiva.org%2Fdocuments%2FGuidelines%2FPregnancy%2F2012%2Fhiv1030_6.pdf&amp;token=srDXoyReDkWvsLxKXzl0NIOH1iEv31obf9mcFGNmxIGRINGWiGprNkeCgOO%2B6gvKpHLrfxPz7zRQZW8DMoIFhG98T6TZQSpgKBr89ojjwBA%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15799" target="_blank">British HIV Association</a>, and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eacsociety.org%2Fmedia%2Fguidelines-10.1_30032021_1.pdf&amp;token=Bvj5NxRs5ijEEMk8LjlYK95jD0US41BPUqABocSuVJCarOUgQO3jePGxWWdzMPckAfYejgLpcb4YRU5364zjuw38GRcWXfYr2eEoan2CON8%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15799" target="_blank">European AIDS Clinical Society</a> [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].

All pregnant women with HIV should receive ART, regardless of CD4 cell count or plasma HIV viral load, to prevent vertical transmission and to treat their HIV infection. The combination of antepartum, intrapartum, and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis is recommended to maximize infant pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis and suppress maternal viral load below the limit of detection throughout pregnancy to decrease the risk of transmission. In resource-rich countries, with widespread use of ART during pregnancy, the incidence of vertical transmission of HIV is estimated at less than 1 percent [<a href="#rid1">1-3,7-12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H328751"><span class="h2">HIV viremia and risk of infant infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, the risk of vertical transmission declines with decreasing levels of maternal HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) (eg, &lt;1000 copies/mL) although there is still some element of risk even at low RNA levels [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>In a prospective cohort study, HIV RNA levels were serially measured in 1542 women with HIV who gave birth from 1990 to 2000 to assess the relationship between plasma viremia, the type of therapeutic intervention, and the risk of HIV vertical transmission [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The risk of HIV transmission declined with lower levels of maternal viremia at delivery. HIV transmission rates ranged from 1 percent for patients with a nondetectable viral load (&lt;400 copies/mL) compared with 23 percent for those with a viral load &gt;30,000 copies/mL. Even at low levels of viremia, the risk decreases with further reductions. In a study of 14,630 women with HIV who were receiving antepartum ART in France between 2000 and 2017, vertical transmission rates were higher among those first initiating ART during pregnancy (73 of 7448; 0.99 percent) compared with those on ART at conception (9 of 6316; 0.14 percent) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Among women on ART at conception, the rate of vertical transmission was 2.42 percent (8 of 330) in women with viral load at delivery &gt;400 copies/mL, 0.20 percent (1 of 504) for those with viral load 50 to 399 copies/mL, and 0 percent (0 of 5482) for women with viral load under 50 copies/mL. </p><p>These data support the use of ART, ideally initiated prior to conception, with the goal of full viral suppression to decrease the risk of vertical HIV transmission [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. These data also highlight the fact that women with a very low viral load can still transmit HIV to their infants, although the risk is low. This residual risk may be related to the presence of detectable HIV in the genital secretions. Thus, ART is recommended in all pregnant women for the prevention of vertical transmission, regardless of the mother’s viral load.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H328983"><span class="h2">Efficacy of ART in preventing transmission</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Numerous studies have documented the efficacy of antiretroviral use in decreasing the risk of mother to child HIV transmission. In 1994, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Clinical Trial 076 evaluated the safety and efficacy of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a> prophylaxis in preventing vertical transmission among 477 pregnant individuals with HIV [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Zidovudine was administered during the antepartum and intrapartum period to the mother and in the infant for the first six weeks of life. Women who were randomly assigned to the intervention arm had a significantly lower risk of transmitting HIV infection to their newborn (25 versus 8 percent) with minimal toxic side effects.</p><p>After this landmark trial conducted in the United States and France, many subsequent clinical studies of HIV vertical transmission have been performed in resource-limited settings to determine if lower-cost medications could be used or if alternative strategies could be as effective. Much of these data are not directly applicable to resource-rich countries due to varying HIV genotypes, patient populations, and infant feeding practices. However, illustrative concepts have emerged from these clinical trials that are also instructive for management of patients in resource-rich settings (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3799.html" rel="external">"Prevention of vertical HIV transmission in resource-limited settings", section on 'Maternal antiretroviral therapy'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A combination regimen is more effective in reducing HIV transmission than a single-drug regimen [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A three-part strategy (ie, antepartum, intrapartum, and infant prophylaxis) is more effective than giving medications only during the intrapartum and/or postpartum periods [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Starting ART before or earlier in pregnancy is more effective in reducing vertical transmission than starting late in pregnancy [<a href="#rid12">12,20,21</a>].

For treatment-naïve women, earlier initiation of ART is associated with increased likelihood of viral suppression by the time of delivery and decreased risk of transmission [<a href="#rid12">12,21-24</a>]. Thus, we recommend initiation of ART as soon as HIV is diagnosed or as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed in women with an established HIV diagnosis if they are not already receiving ART.</p><p>Drug resistance testing is indicated prior to ART initiation for all individuals with detectable virus, but ART should be initiated as soon as possible without delaying until availability of those results; regimen should be adjusted after results return if necessary. (See <a class="local">'Drug resistance testing'</a> below and <a class="local">'ART selection and management'</a> below.)</p><p>For pregnant women who are not yet on ART, the rate of virologic control after initiation of ART appears comparable to that in nonpregnant women. As an example, in a study of 519 treatment-naïve pregnant women initiating ART, 93 percent had achieved a HIV viral level &lt;400 copies/mL by the third month of therapy [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Available data additionally suggest that earlier initiation of ART is associated with increased likelihood of viral suppression by the time of delivery [<a href="#rid21">21,23,24</a>]. In a cohort of 671 ART-naïve pregnant women in the United States who initiated ART during pregnancy, a detectable viral load (&gt;400 copies/mL) at delivery was documented in 13 percent and was associated with antiretroviral initiation at a later gestational age [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Twenty-four percent of women who initiated the regimen during the third trimester had a detectable viral load.</p><p>Accordingly, earlier ART initiation is associated with a lower risk of vertical transmission [<a href="#rid12">12,22</a>]. A study of 14,630 women who received antepartum ART in France between 2000 and 2017, the rate of vertical transmission was 0.14 percent among women receiving ART at conception and 0.52 percent, 0.75 percent, and 1.67 percent for women initiating ART in the first, second, or third trimester, respectively. No transmission occurred among 5482 infants born to women who received ART before conception, continued ART throughout pregnancy, and had a viral load &lt;50 copies/mL at delivery [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p>Some women may prefer delaying ART until after completion of the first trimester, when the fetus is less susceptible to the potential teratogenic effects of medications, but we recommend not delaying ART given the established safety of ART. Moreover, later initiation of ART is less effective in reducing in utero transmission of HIV [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] and if ART is delayed beyond 28 weeks gestation, HIV RNA may not be fully suppressed by the time of delivery, leading to an increased risk of vertical transmission [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H328768"><span class="h1">ART SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2033004"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Generally, pregnant individuals can receive the same regimens recommended for treatment of nonpregnant adults when data are sufficient to determine whether drug exposure during pregnancy is adequate. However, some newer drug regimens recommended as preferred agents for nonpregnant adults have only limited data or have not yet been studied in pregnancy and are not generally recommended for pregnant individuals first initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy. However, many pregnant individuals are already receiving ART when they become pregnant. Regimens with limited pregnancy data may generally be continued in pregnant individuals who have virologic suppression; more frequent viral load testing (eg, every one to two months during pregnancy) is recommended to confirm continued virologic suppression.</p><p>In pregnant women, antiretroviral regimen selection should consider the resistance profile of the virus, the safety and efficacy of the drugs in the mother and fetus, the convenience and adherence potential of the regimen, the potential for drug interactions with other medications, and pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy. For women initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy, regimen selection is similar to that for nonpregnant patients, with the exception that certain agents that are preferred in the general population with HIV may not be preferred in pregnancy because of limited clinical experience and/or lack of pharmacokinetic data to inform appropriate dosing during pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Preferred antiretroviral agents for those who are treatment-naïve'</a> below.) </p><p>Treatment-experienced women on a suppressive antiretroviral regimen can usually continue it even if the agents are not specifically preferred during pregnancy, unless the regimen contains agents that either have poor safety or uncertain pharmacokinetic profiles in pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'On ART with viral suppression'</a> below.)</p><p>For both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced women, it is important to be aware that pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy may require increased dosing, more frequent dosing, or boosting of certain medications, especially protease inhibitors. (See <a class="local">'Selecting the third drug'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3778.html" rel="external">"Safety and dosing of antiretroviral medications in pregnancy", section on 'Protease inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>Decisions about the choice of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy should be made by the woman following discussion with her health care provider of the potential benefits and risks of each regimen. <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicalinfo.hiv.gov%2Fen%2Fguidelines%2Fperinatal%2Fwhats-new-guidelines&amp;token=%2ButYo0U4%2F6x2vFpQ8LMkBwjc4HKS5cbFAlHWmeZK3Ax1JnwbYfPxeChsah2drwfVbOS2z3lBtHkvWNXW1yggrGs1a5xmhiPC74IWUzeg0Gc%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=15799" target="_blank">Guidelines produced by the United States Department of Health and Human Services</a> are updated regularly and include preferred regimens in pregnancy.

ART should be initiated in pregnant women prior to receiving the results of the resistance testing; if necessary, the regimen can be subsequently modified based on the results of the resistance assay. This is particularly important if the mother presents late for care, as the risk of transmission is associated with the duration of antenatal ART and level of viral suppression at delivery.

The combined use of antepartum, intrapartum, and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis maximizes infant pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis to decrease the risk of HIV acquisition. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rationale for maternal ART</strong> − Fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women has two separate but related purposes: reduction of vertical transmission and treatment of maternal HIV disease. All pregnant women with HIV should receive combination ART, regardless of CD4 cell count or plasma HIV viral load. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for maternal ART'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When to initiate ART</strong> − For treatment-naïve pregnant women, we recommend prompt initiation of ART regardless of gestational age (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Earlier initiation of an antiretroviral regimen is associated with increased likelihood of viral suppression by the time of delivery and thus decreased risk of transmission to the fetus. (See <a class="local">'When to initiate ART during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General principles of selecting an ART regimen</strong> − Selecting a regimen that is active against the patient’s virus based on the resistance profile is the primary objective. Within that constraint, we generally favor agents with a documented history of safety in pregnancy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97684" href="/z/d/graphic/97684.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Other factors that inform the regimen selection are patient factors such as adherence potential, tolerability, other comorbidities, previous exposure to antiretrovirals, and pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preferred ART regimen for those who are treatment-naïve</strong> − Treatment-naïve pregnant woman should be started on a regimen that consists of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="90345" href="/z/d/drug information/90345.html" rel="external">dolutegravir</a> or ritonavir-boosted <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8842" href="/z/d/drug information/8842.html" rel="external">darunavir</a> as a third drug  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97684" href="/z/d/graphic/97684.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In general, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="110861" href="/z/d/drug information/110861.html" rel="external">tenofovir alafenamide</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8594" href="/z/d/drug information/8594.html" rel="external">emtricitabine</a> as the NRTI backbone and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="90345" href="/z/d/drug information/90345.html" rel="external">dolutegravir</a> as the third drug (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/z/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">Lamivudine</a> is a reasonable alternative to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8594" href="/z/d/drug information/8594.html" rel="external">emtricitabine</a>, although it is not available in a single-pill coformulation with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="110861" href="/z/d/drug information/110861.html" rel="external">tenofovir alafenamide</a>. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9895" href="/z/d/drug information/9895.html" rel="external">Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> is a reasonable alternative to tenofovir alafenamide if there is concern for excessive weight gain during pregnancy or if tenofovir alafenamide is not available. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The individual agents should be chosen from those that are preferred in pregnancy because of their substantial clinical use and demonstrated efficacy during pregnancy. ART should be initiated after obtaining resistance testing while awaiting results and can be adjusted after results of a resistance profile of the virus are obtained, if applicable. (See <a class="local">'Preferred antiretroviral agents for those who are treatment-naïve'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to those on ART with viral suppression</strong> − Treatment-experienced women on a virologically suppressive ART regimen that they tolerate can usually continue that regimen when they become pregnant, even if the individual agents are not preferred in pregnancy. However, there are additional considerations for certain regimens (see <a class="local">'On ART with viral suppression'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We suggest that patients who become pregnant while receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="90345" href="/z/d/drug information/90345.html" rel="external">dolutegravir</a> not stop therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>) since dolutegravir does not appear to be associated with increased risk of neural tube defects compared with non-dolutegravir based regimens. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who become pregnant while virologically suppressed on a cobicistat-containing regimen (eg, elvitegravir-cobicistat or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98581" href="/z/d/drug information/98581.html" rel="external">darunavir-cobicistat</a>), we suggest continuing the regimen with frequent monitoring of viral levels throughout pregnancy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). If loss of virologic control occurs, we switch to a more potent regimen. The alternative is to switch up front to a different regimen for the duration of pregnancy. The concern is for possible low drug levels and the potential for virologic failure during pregnancy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to those not on ART or those without viral suppression</strong> − In treatment-experienced pregnant women who are either not on an antiretroviral regimen or are on a failing regimen, antiretroviral selection will be mainly guided by the history of prior antiretroviral drug exposure and results of previous and current resistance testing. In such cases, use of agents that are not preferred in pregnancy may be warranted. (See <a class="local">'On ART without viral suppression'</a> above and <a class="local">'Treatment experienced but not currently on ART'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to those presenting late in pregnancy</strong> − For ART-naïve women who first present late in pregnancy (eg, after 28 weeks gestation), we recommend an integrase-inhibitor-containing regimen (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). These agents can lead to rapid decrease in viral load and resultant viral suppression, ideally by the time of delivery. If a patient has been taking cabotegravir-containing pre-exposure prophylaxis at the time of pregnancy detection, a boosted darunavir-containing regimen is also a reasonable option.
