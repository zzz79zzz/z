(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6491.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H899170409"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The identification of a neonate, infant, or child who has been exposed to lead must be viewed as a public health emergency. The only effective long-term treatment is ending further lead exposure by eradication of environmental lead contamination. Because of the cognitive and behavioral effects of lead toxicity, primary prevention of lead exposure is the single most important strategy in the management of childhood lead poisoning. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention", section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Children at risk because of lead in their environment are often <strong>not</strong> found until elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) are detected during routine screening. At that point, secondary prevention of further lead exposure becomes the main treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56262" href="/z/d/graphic/56262.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Unfortunately, by the time a child is found with an elevated BLL, the neurodevelopmental harm from the exposure may have already occurred [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Chelation therapy may be necessary depending upon the degree of blood lead elevation (see <a class="local">'Lead level 45 to 69 mcg/dL'</a> below and <a class="local">'Symptomatic lead poisoning'</a> below). However, it has limited efficacy. With chronic ingestion or inhalation, lead can be incorporated into the skeletal system, which becomes an endogenous reservoir of lead that is resistant to elimination. While chelating agents can bind to lead in blood, they are ineffective in removing lead from the deep bone stores.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1099860"><span class="h2">Approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because there is no known safe threshold for lead exposure, certain actions should be taken in <strong>all</strong> children with BLLs greater than the United States reference value (97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of blood levels, 3.5 mcg/dL [0.17 micromol/L] since 2021); the timing, urgency, and setting of the interventions vary depending upon the severity of lead toxicity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107472" href="/z/d/graphic/107472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>] (see <a class="local">'Asymptomatic lead exposure and poisoning'</a> below and <a class="local">'Symptomatic lead poisoning'</a> below):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient assessment</strong> – The clinician should perform a complete history and physical examination that focus on identifying the source of lead exposure, symptoms of lead toxicity, and additional persons at risk. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6491.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention", section on 'Exposure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">During this assessment, clinicians should take a careful history to identify potential non-traditional sources of lead exposure (eg, cosmetics, ethnic products, folk medicines such as Ayurvedic medicines, and jewelry) and strongly encourage repeat investigations to assess for these sources if the original home inspection is negative [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Special care should be taken for children in foster care since the management of their lead exposure can be difficult as they may be moving from home to home frequently and may have frequent changes in caregiver [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Additionally, foster homes are not evaluated for lead risks prior to child placement, and children may have increased BLLs while in a foster home.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Children with lead poisoning are at risk for developmental delay and may be eligible to receive Early Intervention Services. Appropriate referrals should be made as indicated. Developmental surveillance should continue throughout childhood, particularly at critical transition points (eg, first, fourth, and sixth/seventh grades) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/615.html" rel="external">"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Investigation for iron deficiency</strong> – Laboratory screening to determine the presence of concurrent iron deficiency is appropriate in all children with detectable or elevated BLLs (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5925.html" rel="external">"Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation for suspected iron deficiency anemia'</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Complete blood count</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Serum ferritin</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>C-reactive protein</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Additional iron studies are suggested in children undergoing chelation. (See <a class="local">'Lead level 45 to 69 mcg/dL'</a> below and <a class="local">'Initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nutritional interventions</strong> – Adequate nutritional intake of calcium, vitamin C, and iron along with regular meals should be routinely recommended to minimize lead absorption and prevent pica [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Fasting should be <strong>avoided</strong> because it increases intestinal lead absorption [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Calcium and vitamin C</strong> – In most patients, two daily servings of dairy or other calcium-rich foods and two servings of fruit or fruit juice provide sufficient calcium and vitamin C in the diet [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Supplementation of these nutrients is typically <strong>not</strong> necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Iron intake and supplementation</strong> – Adequate iron intake is important in all children because iron deficiency causes neurocognitive deficits whether or not lead toxicity is present [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5925.html" rel="external">"Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations of iron deficiency anemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Iron supplementation should <strong>not</strong> occur during chelation therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The role of iron supplementation in children with lead poisoning who are not receiving chelation is unclear. Like calcium, dietary iron is thought to decrease the intestinal absorption of lead. This theory is supported by epidemiologic studies that demonstrate an increased prevalence of iron deficiency among children with lead poisoning [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. However, the association is not present consistently [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Iron supplementation in children with iron deficiency and lead poisoning improves developmental assessment scores independent of BLL [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Evidence for such an effect in iron-replete children is lacking [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Until further data clarify the effect of iron supplementation on lead excretion and the benefit of iron supplementation in iron-replete children with lead toxicity, the decision regarding iron supplementation should be individualized [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Because elevated lead levels may cause constipation and decreased elimination, a diet with adequate fiber should be encouraged to ensure proper evacuation of the bowel and enable rapid clearing of any lead before it can be absorbed. Fresh fruits and vegetables are healthy ways to provide adequate fiber.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lead education for the family</strong> – The family requires education including sources of lead exposure, prevention of exposure, and ways to decrease intestinal absorption of lead  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63418" href="/z/d/graphic/63418.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention", section on 'Education and dust control'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention", section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Testing of other children at risk </strong>– Siblings and other children should be tested for lead poisoning by their primary care providers if they live in the same household or attend the same school/daycare that has been identified as a source of lead exposure. Venous blood testing is recommended. Regional public health personnel, regional poison control centers, and, if available, Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units can assist with interpreting test results and recommending further measures. (See <a class="local">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Notification of appropriate public health authority</strong> – Public health department notification may require that the clinician make a mandated report to a regional health department (eg, city, county, state, or province), depending upon the jurisdiction. More often, the laboratory in which the testing was performed reports the elevated BLL. Clinicians should be aware of the reporting practices of the laboratories they use. However, for those pediatric practices who perform point-of-care testing, all results should be shared with the health department. Central reporting of lead toxicity helps to identify new risk categories for exposure. Ideally, the health department can arrange for inspection of the home and other environments where the child spends time so that remediation can begin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lead abatement</strong> – Many government health departments no longer have funding for lead inspection services. Limited funding has resulted in the inability to identify the lead source for some affected patients. The health care provider should still work with the public health departments to find qualified home inspectors and lead abatement contractors in the region. If a home assessment can be completed, the BLL that triggers a home inspection varies with the jurisdiction, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the home inspection and lead hazard reduction (abatement) occur for all children with levels above the reference level of 3.5 mcg/dL (0.17 micromol/L) with anticipatory guidance, at minimum, for children with any detectable BLLs [<a href="#rid7">7,18</a>]. Given the decrease in the lead reference level and the recognition that there is no safe lead level, the BLL that triggers specific environmental action may be lower in some jurisdictions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6493.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention", section on 'Additional resources'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The health care provider should also inform parents/caregivers that any abatement work must be performed by a contractor licensed to do lead abatement if such licensing is performed in the jurisdiction. Families should <strong>not</strong> attempt abatement themselves for fear that they could make the environment more dangerous.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up lead testing</strong> – The child and siblings should have follow-up lead levels. The schedule for these tests varies depending upon the original level  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107472" href="/z/d/graphic/107472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3922967509"><span class="h1">ASYMPTOMATIC LEAD EXPOSURE AND POISONING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Categories of lead poisoning have been defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, given that there is no safe blood lead level (BLL), all children with a detectable lead level warrant education and an environmental investigation. (See <a class="local">'Approach'</a> above.) </p><p>As levels increase, hospitalization and chelation may also be necessary depending upon symptoms, chronicity of lead exposure, and whether lead-safe housing for the child can be assured. When lead-safe housing cannot be assured, hospitalization will remove the child from the lead source and is a key component of successful treatment. Our recommendations below regarding management of elevated BLLs in asymptomatic children are largely consistent with the guidelines provided by the CDC [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p>When screening for lead poisoning, venous samples are preferred because they more accurately represent the child's current exposure to lead. Nevertheless, capillary samples are frequently obtained because of the convenience and immediate results provided by point-of-care testing. Because environmental lead contamination on the skin can lead to falsely elevated lead levels in capillary samples, they require confirmation of positive results using venous blood testing. However, capillary samples do serve as an indicator of lead in the environment. Thus, even if a venous sample does not confirm an elevated BLL, the elevated capillary level indicates that education should be provided. Hair and urine samples should <strong>not</strong> be used for diagnosis of lead poisoning. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6491.html" rel="external">"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Lead levels'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to screening for lead poisoning is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">"Screening tests in children and adolescents", section on 'Lead poisoning'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2110397806"><span class="h2">Undetectable BLL &lt;3.5 mcg/dl (current reference level)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A BLL below the current reference level is found in 97.5 percent of children aged one to five years, according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. However, no level of blood should be considered acceptable, and the clinician may need to reassess the child's environment in the future. The limit of detection for lead can vary by lab and is typically between 1 and 3.3 mcg/dL [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The child may need to be retested depending upon age or other risk factors for lead exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53953" href="/z/d/graphic/53953.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">"Screening tests in children and adolescents", section on 'Lead risk assessment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H729121544"><span class="h2">Detectable BLL 3.5 to 14 mcg/dL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A result between 3.5 and 5 mcg/dL, the 2021 and 2012 reference levels, may be within the variability of the test and present uncertainty as to the accuracy of the result. Clinicians should retest to establish a trend: a confirmed BLL at or above 3.5 mcg/dL is found in 2.5 percent of children aged one to five years. </p><p>Children with detectable BLLs 3.5 to 14 mcg/dL (0.17 to 0.68 micromol/L) should have a confirmatory venous BLL within one to three months  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107472" href="/z/d/graphic/107472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Retesting should be performed even if the original specimen was a venous sample to make sure that the BLL is not increasing rapidly. If the level remains the same or is decreasing, then monitoring of the level should occur every three months until it is &lt;3.5 mcg/dL (0.17 micromol/L).</p><p>Once the BLL is confirmed, children with detectable BLLs that are &lt;14 mcg/dL (0.68 micromol/L) warrant the following management  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107472" href="/z/d/graphic/107472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] (see <a class="local">'Approach'</a> above):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History and physical examination with emphasis on possible sources of lead exposure and screening for iron deficiency anemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family education regarding the sources of potential lead exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63418" href="/z/d/graphic/63418.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Home inspection for the source of lead exposure.

However, any detectable lead ≥3.5 mcg/dL (0.17 micromol/L) warrants careful evaluation and an attempt at determining the source of lead exposure.</p><p>This approach to detectable BLLs recognizes that there is no safe lead level. Thus, even children with detectable BLLs &lt;3.5 mcg/dL (0.17 micromol/L) may be at risk for neurocognitive deficits [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>]. The reference level set by the CDC is <strong>not</strong> necessarily a level in which specific action is taken but one that documents the level at which the large majority (ie, 97.5 percent) of US children who have been tested for lead exposure fall.</p><p>Furthermore, all children should be monitored regularly for developmental and behavioral problems, and parents/caregivers should receive anticipatory guidance that promotes optimal development for their children regardless of their BLL.
