         Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP; also called Swedish porphyria, pyrroloporphyria, intermittent acute porphyria) is an acute neurovisceral porphyria resulting from a partial deficiency of the heme biosynthetic enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS). The gene is most commonly referred to as
         <em>
          HMBS
         </em>
         . AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder with low penetrance; a variety of exacerbating factors and unknown modifying genes determine whether symptoms will occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite its well-characterized molecular genetics, the diagnosis of AIP is challenging. Symptoms are often vague and nonspecific; other causes of neurologic findings and abdominal pain are numerous; and acute porphyria is rare and frequently not included in the differential diagnosis. Clues from the family history may be absent, because symptoms are not present in the majority of family members with a pathogenic variant in the
         <em>
          HMBS
         </em>
         gene. Even if acute porphyria is considered, many clinicians are unfamiliar with appropriate testing that can readily establish or exclude this diagnosis. Also, testing offered by different laboratories lacks consistency and harmonization. As a consequence, diagnosis and life-saving treatment are often delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AIP will be reviewed here. Management of AIP and a general overview of the porphyrias are presented separately. (See

         Porphyrias are caused by alterations in the enzymes of heme biosynthesis. Heme is essential in the function of many hemoproteins, including hemoglobin and hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes.

         The liver rather than the bone marrow is the source of overproduction of heme pathway intermediates in patients with hepatic porphyrias such as AIP.

         The central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems are affected when levels of certain heme pathway intermediates are elevated in the circulation, suggesting neurotoxic effects of one or more intermediates. Some neurologic manifestations may result from heme depletion in neuronal cells, although this remains unproven. (See

         AIP is caused by heterozygosity for a pathogenic variant in the gene encoding porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) and previously referred to as uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with low penetrance.
        </p>
        <p>
         More than 400 pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          HMBS
         </em>
         have been recognized in AIP, all of which lead to severe loss of PBGD enzymatic activity from the mutant allele. Virtually all remaining PBGD activity is due to expression from the unaffected allele.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no convincing evidence for genotype-phenotype correlation in AIP (particular variants do not predict disease severity). Rather, disease severity is highly variable, even within families that share the same variant. Disease severity is affected by a variety of environmental and other factors that act primarily by increasing expression of an enzyme upstream of PBGD in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1). This enzyme controls the rate of heme biosynthesis in the liver. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Enzyme deficiency'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Exacerbating factors'

        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         gene is transcribed as two separate splice variants, one erythroid-specific (expressed only in erythroid precursor cells), the other a housekeeping form expressed in all cell types, including hepatocytes and to a minor extent erythroid cells  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96535" href="/z/d/graphic/96535.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The two isoforms are produced through alternative splicing of two distinct primary mRNA transcripts arising from two different promoters for the same gene [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The housekeeping promoter (upstream of exon 1) is active in all tissues, while the erythroid-specific promoter (upstream of exon 2) is only active in erythroid cells. Sequences in the erythroid promoter are recognized by erythroid-specific trans-acting factors, such as GATA-1 and NF-E2 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In AIP, the
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         variant always affects hepatic PBGD (the housekeeping form of the enzyme). The erythroid enzyme is generally affected as well because a region of the gene used for transcribing both housekeeping and erythroid forms is usually affected, although a resulting deficiency of the erythroid enzyme is not important in causing the disease. Disease-causing variants in some families (splice-site mutations in exon 1, base transitions in intron 1) result in decreased PBGD expression in non-erythroid tissues including the liver, but not in erythroid cells, because transcription of the gene in erythroid cells starts downstream of the site of the mutation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In these AIP families, erythrocyte PBGD activity is within the normal range in all those who have inherited the familial variant. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Confirmatory testing'
         </a>

         Pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         cause AIP because they decrease hepatic PBGD activity. This cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the third step in heme biosynthesis, whereby four molecules of porphobilinogen (PBG; a five-membered pyrrole ring) are sequentially condensed to form hydroxymethylbilane (HMB; a linear tetrapyrrole)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117995" href="/z/d/graphic/117995.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). HMB is rapidly metabolized by the fourth enzyme in the pathway to uroporphyrinogen III.
        </p>
        <p>
         The PBGD enzyme is found in two forms: an erythroid-specific form that is synthesized only in red blood cell (RBC) precursors in the bone marrow, and a housekeeping (ubiquitous) form found in the liver and other tissues [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,5,6
         </a>
         ]. Residual amounts of the erythroid-specific enzyme decline as circulating RBCs age, so an increased proportion of younger RBCs can increase the measured activity of erythrocyte PBGD activity. Decreased activity of the hepatic (housekeeping) form of PBGD, rather than the erythroid form, is responsible for AIP.
        </p>
        <p>
         The liver is central to neuronal damage in AIP, as supported by findings from liver transplantation: patients with AIP have marked clinical improvement after liver transplantation. However, if a liver from a patient with AIP is provided to a patient with another disorder such as liver cancer, the recipient typically develops neurovisceral symptoms and elevated PBG [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the causative role of
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         pathogenic variants, the majority of individuals with pathogenic variants do not develop symptomatic AIP and have asymptomatic (latent) AIP throughout life (a pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         is necessary but not sufficient for symptomatic disease). Studies of genomic databases suggest that the penetrance may be as low as 1 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         AIP also becomes latent in some individuals with a history of symptomatic disease after exacerbating factors responsible for their attacks are recognized and eliminated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Only a minority of individuals with pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         have recurrent attacks even after known exacerbating factors are addressed. These individuals are sometimes referred to as "recurrent attack patients"; over time, some may have unexplained improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to reduced PBGD activity, symptomatic AIP requires a marked induction of the housekeeping (ubiquitous) form of the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase (ALAS1), which is upstream of PBGD in the heme synthesis pathway  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117995" href="/z/d/graphic/117995.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). ALAS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for heme synthesis in the liver. Marked ALAS1 induction leads to increased production and accumulation of ALA and PBG, which are potentially toxic intermediates. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Laboratory and imaging findings'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         ALAS1 synthesis is normally regulated by a pool of "free" heme in hepatocytes that is not yet committed to hemoprotein synthesis. An increase in this "free" heme pool represses the synthesis of ALAS1. Most of the heme synthesized in liver is used to make hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are abundant and turn over rapidly. Thus, the pool of "free" or regulatory heme in hepatocytes is depleted by substances that induce CYP synthesis. CYP inducers and reduced food intake can also directly induce synthesis of hepatic ALAS1.
        </p>
        <p>
         ALAS1 synthesis is induced by the following:

         Depletion of the regulatory hepatic "free" heme pool, which in AIP is further favored by a partial deficiency of PBGD.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         Some drugs, xenobiotics, and sex hormones (especially progesterone) that may induce synthesis of ALAS1 and CYPs [

         Metabolic stress, which may induce hepatic heme oxygenase and accelerate heme destruction and depletion of the regulatory heme pool, although this mechanism is not proven in AIP. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nutrition, glucose metabolism, and stress'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of these factors contribute in an additive fashion to induce ALAS1 and increase levels of ALA and PBG, leading to exacerbations of AIP.
        </p>
        <p>
         PBGD has a unique cofactor, a dipyrromethane, that binds to its catalytic site, upon which four additional pyrroles are assembled, forming a linear hexapyrrole; after formation of the hexapyrrole, HMB is released [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. It is possible, although unproven, that high concentrations of PBG that accumulate during exacerbations of AIP may inhibit the interaction of this cofactor with the enzyme and further reduce hepatic PBGD activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         ALA and PBG are colorless. However, PBG degrades to form porphobilin, a brownish product excreted in urine. In addition to ALA and PBG, urinary porphyrins are also increased in AIP. Their formation may be enzymatic or in part non-enzymatic. At high concentrations in urine, PBG molecules can randomly associate non-enzymatically to form a mixture of uroporphyrin isomers. However, there is evidence that porphyrins in AIP are predominantly isomer III, which are formed enzymatically, perhaps from ALA transported to tissues other than the liver [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Porphobilin and increased porphyrins account for the reddish-brown urine seen during acute attacks. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bladder dysfunction/red urine'
         </a>

         Neurologic dysfunction is responsible for the symptoms of AIP. Symptoms may be due to a combination of central, peripheral, sensory, motor, and autonomic nervous system abnormalities. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The exact mechanism of these nervous system abnormalities that occur in all acute porphyrias is unknown. The most favored explanation is that one or more heme pathway intermediates that are overproduced by the liver, or products derived from them, are neurotoxic. Favorable experience with liver transplantation in AIP, which corrects PBGD deficiency in the liver but not in other tissues, supports an essential role for the liver in the neuropathic processes [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. A less favored hypothesis is that deficiency of heme limits formation of cellular hemoproteins important for neuronal or vascular functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supporting the role of ALA or an ALA derivative as the pathogenic intermediate in AIP includes the following findings:

         The frequency and severity of AIP attacks is highly variable, even within a family in which multiple members share the same gene variant. This variability of disease severity is thought to be linked to unknown modifying genetic factors and variable exposure to exacerbating factors, most of which affect expression of hepatic ALAS1 and/or deplete the regulatory pool of heme that normally represses ALAS1 expression. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathogenesis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In many cases, it is apparent that unknown modifying genes and external exacerbating factors are additive. For example, in a study that evaluated acute attacks in 47 individuals with acute porphyria receiving anesthetic agents (33 of whom had AIP), porphyric symptoms were worsened by anesthesia in 9 of 14 patients who already had symptoms; in contrast, none of the 37 patients who received an anesthetic during an asymptomatic period developed symptoms due to the anesthetic [

        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients continue to have attacks of AIP after known exacerbating factors are addressed, indicating that disease-modifying genes or other environmental inducers of ALAS1 remain to be identified.

         Starvation and/or reduced intake of calories and/or carbohydrates can exacerbate AIP. Reduced caloric or carbohydrate intake lead to increased ALAS1 expression, which is mediated by increases in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38-41

        <p>
         The role of glucose in suppressing ALAS1 expression explains the exacerbation of AIP and other acute porphyrias by reduced intake of calories and carbohydrates, which may occur during illness, surgery, or other stresses. In such circumstances, increases in ALA and PBG and symptoms of porphyria can be reversed by carbohydrate administration, reflecting down-regulation of PGC-1alpha [

         – AIP is a disease of adults. It typically presents in the third or fourth decades of life. Acute attacks are exceedingly rare before puberty, and few well-documented instances of AIP in children are described in the literature. In one series of 204 cases, approximately 5 percent of patients retrospectively reported symptoms beginning before age 14, but these were not biochemically confirmed at the time [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         The lack of major AIP symptoms before puberty was illustrated in a Swedish registry that evaluated 61 healthy children aged 3 to 16 years, who were diagnosed with AIP based on DNA testing rather than symptoms [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48

         ]. Clinical findings were evaluated prospectively for approximately 2.5 years, during which time symptoms developed in only six children (10 percent). In these six cases, symptoms were generally mild and of short duration (eg, abdominal pain or nausea for two or three days). None of the children had paresis or other severe symptoms. Moreover, urinary levels of ALA and PBG were elevated only slightly or not at all during these episodes. Since abdominal pain is reported in 10 to 20 percent of healthy children, these findings may not be different from the general population. (See

         ). These symptoms are due to abnormalities of the peripheral, autonomic, and central nervous systems. Symptoms typically resolve between attacks, although patients can develop chronic symptoms, especially after many years of repeated attacks. (See

         Manifest (symptomatic) AIP is characterized by acute attacks of neurovisceral symptoms accompanied by elevations in urinary porphyrin precursors and porphyrins. Attacks develop over hours to days and persist for days to weeks, depending upon precipitating factors and treatment. An exacerbating factor is often apparent but may not be present in patients with frequent recurrent attacks. The frequency of attacks is highly individual for each patient. These acute neurovisceral symptoms are identical to other acute porphyrias.

         Abdominal pain is the most common and often one of the earliest symptoms in AIP, occurring in 85 to 95 percent of patients with acute attacks  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856" href="/z/d/graphic/56856.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Because the pain and other symptoms are neurologic rather than infectious or inflammatory, abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis are usually minimal or absent during an acute attack. If present, these findings suggest an inflammatory disease rather than a direct manifestation of AIP. However, the presence of an inflammatory process does not exclude the possibility of an AIP attack; infection may be a precipitating factor for an acute attack, and treatment for infection and AIP may be needed simultaneously.

        </p>
        <p>
         Motor weakness, when present, usually begins proximally in the upper extremities and may progress to the lower extremities and distally. Especially with prolonged attacks, it may also involve cranial nerves and lead to bulbar paralysis, respiratory impairment, and death. Advanced motor neuropathy with quadriplegia and respiratory paralysis can occur and is potentially reversible with appropriate treatment (intravenous

        <p>
         Insomnia is often an early symptom of an AIP attack. Other acute neuropsychiatric manifestations include anxiety, restlessness, agitation, hallucinations, hysteria, disorientation, delirium, apathy, depression, phobias, and altered consciousness, ranging from somnolence to coma.

         Central nervous system (CNS) involvement can also cause seizures and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also called reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, and involvement of the hypothalamus can result in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which may also cause seizures from hyponatremia [

         A high index of suspicion for acute porphyria is desirable because the presenting findings are nonspecific and can be quite variable; early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic AIP can avert long-term and life-threatening complications.

        <p>
         Porphyria should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with unexplained abdominal pain and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms even when acute porphyria is not the most likely diagnosis (ie, even when the index of suspicion is not yet high).

         While every patient with an acute episode of abdominal pain should not be screened for acute porphyria, testing is appropriate after an initial workup for more common causes is unrevealing. (See

         Urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and porphyrin excretion is increased during attacks and may decline between attacks; however, levels often remain elevated between frequent exacerbations and are sometimes elevated in those who have never had symptoms. Individuals with elevated urinary heme intermediates who have never had symptoms are sometimes referred to as "asymptomatic high excreters." (See

         ALA and PBG are less elevated in hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and variegate porphyria (VP) than in AIP and may decline more quickly with attack resolution. In ALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP), the rarest type of porphyria, PBG was normal or modestly elevated, with marked elevations in ALA and porphyrins (mostly coproporphyrin III) in all documented cases.

         For first-line testing (screening) for AIP and other acute porphyrias, it is recommended to measure PBG and total porphyrins using a spot/random urine, with results normalized to creatinine. Measuring ALA is not essential, since all conditions that elevate ALA will also elevate urine porphyrins.

         Low erythrocyte PBGD activity is found in approximately 90 percent of patients with AIP regardless of acute symptoms. (See

         In addition to the importance of considering AIP, early testing for elevated PBG using a spot urine is also important because PBG testing is not available in-house at most medical centers, and there will likely be delay in obtaining a result from an outside laboratory. The laboratory should be asked to expedite PBG testing. Urinary PBG testing is very sensitive and specific for AIP, HCP, and VP when done in the setting of acute symptoms.

         </span>
         AIP (or other acute porphyria) should be suspected in an adult with otherwise unexplained neurovisceral symptoms, such as abdominal pain; vomiting; constipation; muscle weakness; psychiatric symptoms; or pain in the limbs, head, neck, or chest  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856" href="/z/d/graphic/56856.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Previous similar and recurrent symptoms may have occurred. Importantly, a negative family history is not helpful in excluding the diagnosis of AIP, because symptomatic disease may skip generations; in some families, only a single individual who carries the AIP disease mutation has manifestations of AIP. Ethnicity is also not helpful because AIP occurs in all races. Imaging is not useful for diagnosing AIP, but it may be performed during the evaluation to look for other causes of the clinical findings. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnostic approach depends on whether the patient is symptomatic at the time of testing. Symptomatic patients are tested for elevations of urinary PBG and total porphyrins; if PBG is clearly elevated, the patient can be diagnosed with acute porphyria, and treatment can (and often should) be initiated without waiting for additional testing to determine the specific type of acute porphyria. However, samples for this subsequent testing should be obtained at the time of the acute attack (before therapy is initiated) because samples obtained before treatment have the greatest likelihood of providing a clear diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Major features of the diagnostic evaluation include the following  (

         – Once the patient is determined to have a substantial PBG elevation, the specific diagnosis of AIP, HCP, or VP can be established by biochemical testing of urine (for ALA, PBG, and porphyrins), plasma and stool (for porphyrins). To ensure the most accurate results, samples should be collected before treatment is initiated because therapy (especially with

         ). In practice, urinary PBG and some or all of this additional biochemical testing is often ordered simultaneously before treatment with hemin. Measuring creatinine on the same sample is important, since a very dilute urine sample may give a falsely low PBG value, and this is obviated by expressing results as per gram of creatinine. (See

         It is also useful to measure "baseline" PBG levels between attacks for comparison. However, in individuals with a known diagnosis of AIP, subsequent acute attacks are often similar to past attacks, and the diagnosis of an acute attack is confirmed clinically (based on symptoms rather than biochemical testing). Treatment of an acute attack in a patient with known AIP should not be delayed while awaiting the results of PBG levels. (See

         Urinary PBG should be measured on a spot urine sample, which avoids delays from collecting a 24-hour urine. Unfortunately, an inexpensive kit for rapid, semiquantitative determination is no longer marketed. Therefore, it is necessary to have a rapid method for urine PBG measurement available on-site, or to ask referral laboratories how rapidly a quantitative result can be obtained and to expedite performance and reporting of the test. The value of a rapid result is in the ability to initiate immediate treatment with

         Send-out testing for PBG and porphyrins may be the only option when screening for acute porphyrias, and results may take one to two weeks.

Urine ALA is markedly increased in ADP, as well as other disorders in which ALAD activity is diminished, such as lead poisoning. Results of this extended urine testing are interpreted along with results of plasma and stool porphyrin testing  (

        <p>
         Spot samples obtained at the time of acute symptoms (before treatment) are most reliable; however, obtaining these samples should not delay treatment in a patient who is acutely ill and has a substantial elevation in urinary PBG and/or ALA (or a history of these findings). Results from a spot fecal sample obtained one to two days after starting treatment are likely to be accurate, depending on intestinal transport time. If samples were not obtained during the acute attack, these can be obtained during a subsequent attack; alternatively, comprehensive biochemical testing with or without DNA testing can be done during asymptomatic periods.

         Increases in urinary porphyrins in the setting of normal ALA and PBG may occur in HCP and VP, in which ALA and PBG increases are smaller in magnitude and briefer in duration than with AIP. Elevated urinary porphyrins without elevated plasma or fecal porphyrins (ie, nonspecific porphyrinuria) may occur in other medical conditions, especially hepatobiliary disease, and is not consistent with any of the acute porphyrias.

         Erythrocyte PBGD activity is highly dependent upon red blood cell (RBC) age, and an increase in the proportion of younger RBCs in the circulation (which may not always have the appearance of reticulocytes) can raise the activity into the normal range in patients who have AIP and a concurrent condition (sometimes inapparent) such as hemolytic anemia or liver disease [

          Latent AIP

The term "latent" is sometimes used for heterozygous individuals who have never had symptoms or PBG elevation and sometimes used for individuals who had manifest AIP in the past but no symptoms for many years, with or without continued PBG elevation.

         The major considerations in the differential diagnosis of AIP are other causes of abdominal pain; other causes of neuropathic or neuropsychiatric symptoms; other causes of liver disease/abnormal liver function tests; and other porphyrias. Like AIP, these conditions may present with nonspecific symptoms. Unlike AIP, non-porphyric conditions are associated with normal urinary PBG. Isolated elevation of urine porphyrins (ie, without increased ALA and/or PBG) is more suggestive of a non-porphyric condition rather than AIP; HCP and VP remain possible because urinary ALA and PBG can normalize rapidly in these conditions, which are excluded by further biochemical testing [

         <strong>
          Abdominal pain
         </strong>
         – Abdominal pain can occur in numerous clinical settings. Acute porphyrias should be considered after initial evaluation excludes other more common causes of abdominal pain. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), other causes of abdominal pain do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. However, hepatobiliary disease may be associated with elevations in urinary porphyrins, and lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 may cause elevated ALA and porphyrins. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6862.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain"

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         An individual with porphyria may present with another cause of abdominal pain (appendicitis, diverticulitis, inflammatory or ischemic bowel disease, biliary or kidney/ureteral stones), and these conditions can also precipitate an acute porphyria attack. Therefore, an elevated PBG does not exclude other causes of abdominal pain, and the presence of another cause of abdominal pain does not exclude AIP (or other acute porphyria).

          Neuropathy
         </strong>
         – Neuropathies can have a variety of clinical presentations and etiologies. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), other causes of neuropathy, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can mimic AIP, do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. However, lead poisoning causes neuropathy and elevations of urinary ALA and porphyrins. (See

         <strong>
          Neuropsychiatric symptoms
         </strong>
         – Neuropsychiatric symptoms can include anxiety, agitation, insomnia, hallucinations, seizures. There are many potential causes, including neurodegenerative disease, alcohol and drug use, infectious, autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitides, psychiatric illness, and psychotropic medications. Like AIP, some of these other conditions may be associated with hyponatremia from the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), and abnormalities on neuroimaging may be seen. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), these other causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. (See

          Liver disease/abnormal liver function tests

         – Liver disease due to any cause may be associated with elevated urinary porphyrin excretion, especially coproporphyrin. This occurs because coproporphyrin is normally excreted in both bile and urine, and urinary excretion of coproporphyrin increases when hepatobiliary function is impaired. Patients with liver disease may also have slight elevations in ALA. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), liver disease is not associated with elevated urinary PBG. (See

          Acute porphyrias

         – Like AIP, other acute porphyrias can cause acute neurovisceral attacks characterized by abdominal, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and increases in urinary PBG, ALA, and porphyrins. Unlike AIP, other acute porphyrias, namely HCP, VP, and ADP, have different patterns of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins in urine, plasma or serum, and stool  (

Unlike AIP, HCP is characterized by substantially increased fecal porphyrins, with predominance of coproporphyrin III. (See

PBG elevation may be less marked and more transient in VP than in AIP. Unlike AIP, VP also commonly causes blistering photosensitivity. VP is characterized by substantially increased fecal porphyrins, with a predominance of coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin; in VP, plasma porphyrins are increased with a characteristic peak fluorescence at approximately 626 nm when plasma is diluted at neutral pH, which distinguishes VP from all other types of porphyria.

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – AIP (or other acute porphyria) should be suspected in an adult with unexplained neurovisceral symptoms. Diagnostic delays are common, so previous similar and recurrent symptoms should increase suspicion. A negative family history does not exclude the diagnosis, because symptomatic disease may skip generations. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of the evaluation'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For a previously undiagnosed patient with acute symptoms consistent with acute porphyria, first-line testing should be measurement of urine porphobilinogen (PBG) and total porphyrins  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The most useful results are obtained from samples obtained during the acute attack before treatment is initiated. (See

         <strong>
          Urinary PBG
         </strong>
         – Urinary PBG and total porphyrins are ordered first; if these results are normal, no further testing is needed. Urinary PBG elevation is highly sensitive and specific for the three most common acute porphyrias (AIP, hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], and variegate porphyria [VP]) and is sufficient for initiating treatment, which is the same for all acute porphyrias. Rapid testing for elevated urinary PBG greatly facilitates prompt diagnosis or exclusion of these porphyrias, but is often not available.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In contrast, elevated urinary porphyrins are nonspecific and may be seen in other medical conditions but are useful for detecting HCP and VP, in which PBG may be only transiently elevated, and to identify the fourth acute porphyria (ADP), which is extremely rare and which elevates ALA and coproporphyrin III but not PBG. (See

          'Test urinary PBG and initiate treatment if positive'

         <strong>
          Second-line testing
         </strong>
         – After finding a substantial elevation in urinary PBG, additional diagnostic testing distinguishes AIP from other porphyrias. This testing also determines whether elevation of urine porphyrins, a nonspecific finding, is due to acute porphyria or not. Preferably, samples obtained before treatment with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8970" href="/z/d/drug information/8970.html" rel="external">
          hemin
         </a>
         are used. Testing includes urinary ALA and porphyrins and plasma and stool porphyrins. Urinary porphyrins are fractionated if the total urinary porphyrins are elevated. These tests are likely to have long turnaround times (weeks). If PBG is substantially elevated, plasma and stool samples can be obtained and sent for porphyrin measurements while treatment with hemin is started. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Obtain plasma and stool samples during the acute attack'

          Diagnostic confirmation
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of AIP is confirmed by decreased erythrocyte PBGD and/or a pathogenic variant in the
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         gene. Biochemical plus genetic confirmation is preferred. (See

          Relatives
         </strong>
         – Asymptomatic first-degree relatives are diagnosed by DNA testing. Measuring erythrocyte PBGD activity is less expensive and less reliable. An individual with a pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          HMBS/PBGD
         </em>
         but no symptoms is referred to as having latent AIP. (See
