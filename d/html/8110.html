Angioedema typically affects the skin or mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The swelling is self-limited, although laryngeal involvement may cause fatal asphyxiation. Clinically, this disorder is very similar to hereditary angioedema (HAE), although AAE-C1-INH develops in older patients and is frequently associated with underlying disease, whereas the hereditary disorder presents in younger patients who are otherwise healthy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the management and prognosis of AAE-C1-INH.

Upper airway angioedema usually progresses over hours, although it can occur precipitously. Intubation may become very difficult due to distortion of the anatomy of the upper airway. Because of the dangers associated with laryngeal attacks, it is important to make sure that patients are prepared to respond effectively to the development of symptoms near or in the throat.</p><p>Angioedema may also affect the gastrointestinal tract, causing colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Episodes of abdominal angioedema are often debilitating but are not life threatening. Angioedema affecting the skin is temporarily disfiguring but rarely dangerous, unless it affects the mouth or lips since it can compromise the airway in these situations. The approach to treating abdominal and cutaneous attacks is similar to that used in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8104.html" rel="external">"Hereditary angioedema: Acute treatment of angioedema attacks", section on 'Gastrointestinal attacks'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8104.html" rel="external">"Hereditary angioedema: Acute treatment of angioedema attacks", section on 'Cutaneous attacks'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Patient education about laryngeal edema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with AAE-C1-INH must be counseled about the earliest signs of an attack affecting the upper airway, which typically includes the sensation of a lump or feeling of tightness in the throat or swallowing difficulties. Patients should also have a plan to get prompt and appropriate treatment. Any patient with throat symptoms should seek emergency care immediately. The patient should <strong>not</strong> attempt to manage early laryngeal attacks at home, although, if therapy for self-administration is available and can be given quickly, the patient can initiate therapy and then call for an ambulance to take them to the nearest emergency department. It is important to discuss that, even if the treatment has worked well in the past, the patient should always proceed immediately to an emergency care setting when the throat is involved because all of the first-line therapies take approximately 30 minutes or more to begin working. In rare circumstances, acute treatment, particularly with plasma-derived C1-INH (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8998" href="/d/drug information/8998.html" rel="external">pdC1-INH</a>), can be less effective than in hereditary C1-INH deficiency; thus, a second dose is occasionally required. In contrast, abdominal angioedema or cutaneous angioedema can often be managed by patients at home if they have access to acute treatments. The emergency treatments that are appropriate for administration at home are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8104.html" rel="external">"Hereditary angioedema: Acute treatment of angioedema attacks", section on 'Initiating acute treatment of HAE attacks at home'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87533"><span class="h2">Written treatment plan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AAE-C1-INH is a rare disorder, and few emergency department providers are familiar with the treatment. Patients can be equipped with a document that briefly explains their diagnosis, outlines the indicated treatment for acute attacks, and provides contact information for the supervising clinician  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef57664" href="/d/graphic/57664.html" rel="external">form 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Airway management in laryngeal edema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment and protection of the upper airway is the first and most important management issue in the patient with an acute attack involving any part of the airway because none of the available therapies including C1-INH concentrate, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16808" href="/d/drug information/16808.html" rel="external">icatibant</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9035" href="/d/drug information/9035.html" rel="external">ecallantide</a> can be considered universally effective in all cases. In addition, these agents take time to work, and the patient's airway must be protected in the interim. Asphyxiation remains an important and preventable cause of death in patients with this disorder, even in settings with appropriate medications available. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Intubation should be performed immediately if stridor or signs of respiratory arrest are present. A clinician trained in difficult airway management should be summoned if possible because failed attempts can lead to fatal obstruction. Emergent cricothyroidotomy may be required in rare cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/275.html" rel="external">"Approach to the difficult airway in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/263.html" rel="external">"Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy) in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Once the patient is assessed and either intubated or deemed stable, additional therapies can be considered. Transfer to the intensive care unit should be arranged. Frequent and meticulous monitoring of airway status should continue throughout the course of the attack until complete resolution, and patients should not be discharged until all airway symptoms have resolved.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Pharmacologic treatment of acute attacks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several medications available for acute treatment of episodes of angioedema due to genetic C1-INH deficiency that can be used for AAE-C1-INH.

Observational studies indicate that pdC1-INH is effective in the majority of patients with AAE-C1-INH, reducing the average attack duration by 60 percent or more [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Based on the controlled studies performed in HAE-C1-INH, an initial dose of 20 units/kg is suggested. The dosing, administration, and adverse effects of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8998" href="/d/drug information/8998.html" rel="external">pdC1-INH</a> are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8104.html" rel="external">"Hereditary angioedema: Acute treatment of angioedema attacks", section on 'First-line agents: Dosing, efficacy, and adverse reactions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H87583"><span class="h4">Resistance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A small percentage of patients with AAE-C1-INH become less responsive to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8998" href="/d/drug information/8998.html" rel="external">pdC1-INH</a> over time, requiring higher doses to control symptoms [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. One patient required multiple infusions totaling 12,000 units of pdC1-INH (the usual initial dose is 1500 units) over a period of two hours to control laryngeal edema. The newer therapies for bradykinin-mediated angioedema, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9035" href="/d/drug information/9035.html" rel="external">ecallantide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16808" href="/d/drug information/16808.html" rel="external">icatibant</a>, offer alternatives for the treatment of patients who become resistant to pdC1-INH, and we would suggest trying these if resistance is suspected. (See <a class="local">'Ecallantide'</a> below and <a class="local">'Icatibant'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanism by which resistance to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8998" href="/d/drug information/8998.html" rel="external">pdC1-INH</a> develops appears to involve extremely rapid catabolism of the inhibitor protein, although this has not been formally demonstrated. In blood samples collected from the patient described above, no significant increase of C1-INH function could be detected at any point during the multiple infusions, while C1-INH antigen normalized due to the increase in cleaved C1-INH. These data suggest that the infused C1-INH was rapidly bound by the autoantibodies and converted in its cleaved inactive form upon interaction with target proteases. The patient described above had high levels of anti-C1-INH antibodies in serum.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7577214"><span class="h3">Recombinant C1 inhibitor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are limited data regarding the efficacy of recombinant human C1-INH (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96337" href="/d/drug information/96337.html" rel="external">rhC1-INH</a>; Ruconest [brand name]) in AAE-C1-INH. rhC1-INH has a shorter half-life than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8998" href="/d/drug information/8998.html" rel="external">pdC1-INH</a>.

Plasma contains an array of complement components, including C1-INH.</p><p>Two units is the usual initial dose for treatment of angioedema. This dose can be repeated every two to four hours until there is clinical improvement. Once the attack begins to subside, further plasma is not usually required. If a patient has comorbid conditions that increase the risk for volume overload, then dosing of 10 to 15 mL per kg body weight is recommended instead, with monitoring of volume status and cardiopulmonary function.</p><p>The administration, infection risks, and adverse effects of plasma are reviewed elsewhere.
