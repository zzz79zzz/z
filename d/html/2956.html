         Testicular germ cell tumor (GCT) is a highly curable cancer, with five-year survival rates of over 95 percent. As such, it is essential for survivors of testicular cancer to be monitored for disease recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The follow-up and surveillance for recurrence in patients with testicular cancer who have completed initial definitive therapy is presented here. The initial management of testicular germ cell tumors is discussed separately.

         Routine follow-up care for patients who have successfully completed therapy for testicular cancer consists of periodic history and physical examinations (including testicular examination), assessment of serum tumor markers (beta-hCG, AFP, and LDH), and radiographic studies.

        <p>
         Patients who have rising tumor markers and/or radiographically documented progressive disease following treatment should be evaluated for recurrent disease. (See

         For patients with seminoma, the median time to relapse is 14 months. In addition, most relapses (over 90 percent) occur in the first three years after orchiectomy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         For patients with NSGCT, most relapses (over 95 percent) occur within the first two years after orchiectomy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the vast majority of relapses occur within the first five years for both seminoma and NSGCT, late recurrences can occur [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. In one study that evaluated 1949 patients, 10 of 1123 patients with seminoma (0.8 percent) and 15 of 826 patients with NSGCT (1.8 percent) recurred more than five years after the original diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Other series have reported a higher incidence of late recurrences [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ], but these may be subject to referral bias.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, follow-up is most intensive during the first one to two years after treatment and then gradually decreases. However, most groups now recommend that follow-up continue for at least 10 years following initial treatment because of the risk of late relapse. (See

         Posttreatment history and physical examination should be performed on the same schedule as measurement of tumor markers. Close attention should be paid to cervical and supraclavicular nodal regions, the abdominal exam (for the presence of masses or hepatomegaly), and the presence of neurologic signs or symptoms. (See

         Testicular examination should be performed at each visit because of the higher incidence of contralateral testis cancer in patients with unilateral GCTs and of testis cancers in patients with primary extragonadal GCTs. Testicular ultrasound should be obtained for an equivocal exam. (See

          NSGCT
         </strong>
         – For patients with NSGCTs, serum concentrations of beta-hCG and/or AFP are elevated in 85 percent of patients at diagnosis. Following treatment, periodic measurements of serum beta-hCG and AFP represent the most sensitive means of detecting early relapse. (See

          Seminoma

          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Beta-hCG is increased in 15 to 20 percent of patients with advanced disease. AFP, by definition, is never elevated in patients with pure seminoma [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>

         The utility of periodic CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis was evaluated in a series of 170 patients undergoing surveillance following orchiectomy for stage I NSGCTs [

          10

         ]. History and physical examination, serum tumor markers, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest radiography provided the initial evidence of progression in 38, 71, 71, and 8 percent of patients, respectively. Removal of routine chest radiography from the surveillance protocol would not have altered the detection of progressive disease.

         There is concern about the risk of second malignancies due to the radiation from CT scans. Efforts to reduce the amount of radiation by using different techniques, such as MRI, or changing the number and/or frequency of CT scans remain an area of active investigation. (See

         ]. Tumor relapse was documented in 33 (11.4 percent). Relapse was detected by rising tumor markers only in 27 (82 percent) and by rising tumors markers plus abnormal physical examination in four patients. A total of 10,160 routine CXR were performed during surveillance, and none played a role in detecting tumor relapse. Prior to the initiation of treatment for relapsed disease, all patients but one had elevated serum tumor markers.

         Various urologic and oncologic groups have published guidelines or recommendations based upon histology (NSGCTs versus seminomas) and stage of disease using data from observational studies [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,12-19
         </a>
         ]. There are no prospective randomized trials that define the optimal follow-up strategy for patients who have completed their initial treatment. Although there are some differences in guidelines between these groups, all rely upon interval history and physical examination, assessment of serum tumor markers, CXR, and contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.

          Timing of relapse

          Factors that influence follow-up
         </strong>
         – Posttreatment follow-up is influenced by the histology of the original tumor (seminoma versus nonseminomatous germ cell tumor [NSGCT]), the stage and risk of recurrence at presentation, and initial therapy. (See

         – Follow-up after initial therapy to monitor for disease recurrence includes history and physical examination, serum tumor markers (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG], alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]), and imaging studies (contrast-enhanced computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of abdomen and pelvis, chest radiograph [CXR]).
