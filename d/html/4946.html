         Constrictive pericarditis is the result of scarring and consequent loss of the normal elasticity of the pericardial sac. This leads to impairment of ventricular filling in mid and late diastole. As a result, the majority of ventricular filling occurs rapidly in early diastole and the ventricular volume does not increase after the end of the early filling period.
        </p>
        <p>
         Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by a nondilated rigid ventricle, resulting in severe diastolic dysfunction and restrictive filling that produces hemodynamic changes similar to those in constrictive pericarditis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy both lead to diastolic heart failure with normal (or near normal) systolic function, and characteristically abnormal ventricular filling that results in similar clinical and hemodynamic features. However, because of their markedly different treatments, differentiating between the two conditions is critical. In some patients, the correct diagnosis may be readily suggested from the history or routine diagnostic testing. In others, however, this differentiation cannot be diagnosed before biopsy or even surgical exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
         The distinction between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy will be reviewed here. The basic aspects of constrictive pericarditis and idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy are discussed separately. (See

         An understanding of ventricular volume constraints and ventricular interaction is key in any discussion of the hemodynamic differences between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with constrictive pericarditis, total cardiac volume is fixed by the noncompliant pericardium. The septum is not involved and can therefore bulge toward the left ventricle (LV) when LV volume is less than that on the right. As a result, ventricular interdependence is greatly enhanced. This bulging may be seen on echocardiography, or in some cases, on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, changes in intrathoracic pressure are not transmitted to the cardiac chambers because of obliteration of the pericardial space. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4938.html" rel="external">
          "Constrictive pericarditis: Diagnostic evaluation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In restrictive cardiomyopathy, on the other hand, pericardial compliance is normal. LV systolic function is normal, or in severe cases, may even be reduced. The respiratory variation in intrathoracic pressure is transmitted normally to the cardiac chambers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The different effects of respiration on ventricular filling between the two diseases may be explained by the following mechanisms:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In patients with constrictive pericarditis, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is influenced by the inspiratory fall in intra-thoracic pressure, while the LV pressure is shielded from respiratory pressure variations by the pericardial scar. Thus, inspiration lowers the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and presumably left atrial pressure, but not LV diastolic pressure, thereby decreasing the pressure gradient for ventricular filling. The less favorable filling pressure gradient during inspiration explains the decline in filling velocity. Reciprocal changes occur in the velocity of right ventricular (RV) filling [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. These changes are mediated by the ventricular septum, not by increased systemic venous return.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, inspiration lowers pulmonary wedge and LV diastolic pressures equally, thereby leaving the pressure gradient for ventricular filling and filling velocity virtually unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A lower LV filling pressure gradient with constrictive pericarditis also leads to a delay in mitral valve opening and therefore, a longer isovolumic relaxation time during inspiration. This inspiration decline in the filling gradient is seen in constrictive pericarditis but not restrictive cardiomyopathy.

         In the evaluation of a patient with suspected constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy, the history can provide important clues to other systemic disorders which could predispose to either condition  (

         In the evaluation of constrictive pericarditis versus restrictive cardiomyopathy, the history is most valuable in identifying a systemic disorder which can predispose to either constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy:

         A prior history of pericarditis, trauma, cardiac surgery, or a systemic disease that affects the pericardium (eg, tuberculosis, connective tissue disease, malignancy) makes the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis more likely. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4957.html" rel="external">

         A history of an infiltrative disease that may involve the heart muscle (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) favors the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See

         However, prior thoracic radiation treatment (and rarely amyloidosis) can result in either constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or a condition with features of both constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See

         The vast majority of patients with both constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy display elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) on physical examination  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). From the JVP waveform alone, it is not possible to distinguish between constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, tricuspid regurgitation with an enlarged compliant right atrium, or right heart failure (eg, due to RV infarction or pulmonary hypertension). The contour of the jugular venous pulse in all these conditions is dominated by a deep, steep Y descent. (See

         Approximately 50 percent of patients with constrictive pericarditis may present with a pericardial knock (an accentuated heart sound occurring slightly earlier than a third heart sound, which may be audible and rarely is palpable), which is not expected in restrictive cardiomyopathy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, an audible S3 is frequently present in persons with restrictive cardiomyopathy because of the abrupt cessation of the rapid ventricular filling; this is not usually present in constrictive pericarditis. (See

         Patients suspected of having either constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy, based on history and physical examination, should undergo initial evaluation with electrocardiography (ECG), chest radiography, and echocardiography  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99929" href="/z/d/graphic/99929.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ). While a particular diagnosis is often made following echocardiography, patients commonly undergo cardiac catheterization, during which invasive hemodynamic evaluation can help elucidate the correct diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In most patients, particularly those with prior radiation exposure, there is a role for computed tomography (CT) or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Both CT and CMR provide additional detailed anatomic information about adjacent vascular structures and an accurate measurement of pericardial thickness.

         The ECG may be helpful in distinguishing constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Depolarization abnormalities (such as bundle branch block), ventricular hypertrophy, pathologic Q waves, or impaired atrioventricular conduction strongly favor restrictive cardiomyopathy. Low voltage and isolated repolarization abnormalities can occur in both conditions, although the latter are more common in constrictive pericarditis. Atrial fibrillation is common in the late stages of both diseases. (See

         Plasma concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are increased in numerous conditions, most notably in patients with LV dysfunction. As a result, plasma BNP has been used in the diagnosis of dyspnea and to assess the efficacy of therapy and estimate prognosis in patients with heart failure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3486.html" rel="external">
          "Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         BNP is released in response to LV dysfunction and wall stretch. Wall stretch is increased in restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, in constrictive pericarditis, the myocardium is normal, and stretch is limited by the thickened pericardium. These physiologic differences suggest that measurement of plasma BNP might have value in distinguishing between these two disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
         The usefulness of BNP in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy has been evaluated in several small studies (each with between 11 and 33 patients) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. Mean BNP levels in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy have generally been significantly higher than BNP levels seen in patients with constrictive pericarditis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126665" href="/z/d/graphic/126665.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). In addition, many patients with constrictive pericarditis had BNP levels at or below 100 pg/mL, a level generally considered the threshold for a normal BNP value. However, one study reported considerable overlap of the measured BNP levels between patients with constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy when the BNP value was less than 400 pg/mL [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While the data are intriguing, these observations need to be confirmed in a larger number of patients to more thoroughly determine the accuracy of BNP testing for differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, because the physiologic rationale is strong, we recommend measurement of plasma BNP early in the evaluation of patients with suspected constrictive pericarditis as a normal value (BNP &lt;100 pg/mL) essentially excludes restrictive cardiomyopathy.

         Calcification of the pericardium strongly suggests constrictive pericarditis, but it can also be seen in other conditions, such as asbestosis, which may or may not be associated with constrictive pericarditis  (

         ). However, the absence of calcification is equally compatible with either diagnosis. In one retrospective review of 135 patients with constrictive pericarditis confirmed surgically or at autopsy, only 27 percent had pericardial calcification [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         Mild cardiomegaly on chest radiography is common in both conditions, but more prominent in restrictive cardiomyopathy. This is generally due to atrial rather than ventricular enlargement. Pulmonary venous congestion with or without pleural effusions can be seen in restrictive cardiomyopathy but would not be expected in constrictive pericarditis. (See

         There is no association between increased pericardial thickness and restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, constrictive pericarditis is usually associated with increased thickness of the pericardium  (

         ). A pericardial thickness exceeding 4 mm is highly suggestive of constrictive pericarditis  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, constrictive pericarditis can also occur in the setting of a nonthickened pericardium. Thus, a normal appearing parietal pericardium does not rule out constrictive pericarditis [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Pericardial thickness can be evaluated using a variety of imaging techniques, including echocardiography, CT, and CMR imaging. (See

         While transthoracic echocardiography is the most frequently imaging modality used in the assessment of suspected pericardial disease, it is also one of the least sensitive for detecting pericardial thickening. In a review of 143 patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, a pathologically thickened pericardium (&gt;2 mm) was seen in 82 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 40 percent of patients with constrictive pericarditis had pericardial thickening seen on transthoracic echocardiography. In contrast, pericardial thickness on transesophageal imaging correlates strongly with that obtained by CT [

         In comparison to transthoracic echocardiography, CT and CMR imaging are more sensitive for the detection of increased pericardial thickness. [

         – The respiratory variation in ventricular filling velocity in restrictive cardiomyopathy is usually minimal (less than 10 percent), while patients with constrictive pericarditis may have respiratory variations as high as 30 to 40 percent in ventricular filling velocity (similar to that seen in cardiac tamponade). An echocardiographic study of 30 patients (19 with constrictive pericarditis and 11 with restrictive cardiomyopathy) found that significant respiratory variation in the ventricular inflow peak velocity ≥10 percent predicted constrictive pericarditis with a sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 91 percent, respectively [

         However, the ventricular filling velocity is highly influenced by the level of the left atrial pressure. When left atrial pressure is greatly elevated in a patient with constrictive pericarditis, respiratory variation in ventricular filling may not be observed, whereas patients with lower left atrial pressure (ie, due to volume depletion or earlier stage of disease) may have more noticeable changes in ventricular filling velocities with respiration. Left atrial pressure can be reduced on physical examination by asking a patient to move from the supine to seated position; such a maneuver may elicit the abnormality [

         The ability to assess respirophasic changes in ventricular filling velocities is challenging in patients with atrial fibrillation, due to the presence of variable cardiac cycle length from beat to beat.

In contrast, reversal of hepatic vein flow occurs during inspiration in restrictive cardiomyopathy.

         – The early diastolic Doppler tissue velocity at the mitral annulus (E') is decreased (&lt;8 cm/s) in restrictive cardiomyopathy, due to an intrinsic decrease in myocardial contraction and relaxation. In contrast, the transmitral E' is frequently increased (&gt;12 cm/s) in constrictive pericarditis, since the longitudinal movement of the myocardium is enhanced because of constricted radial motion  (

         Unlike in normal individuals, mitral lateral (and tricuspid) annular E' velocities are often relatively reduced in patients with constrictive pericarditis ("annular reversus"). This reduction may be the result of lateral adhesion of the pericardium while the longitudinal movement of the septal annulus is unimpeded. These mechanics are not evident in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Thus, the ratio between lateral (both mitral and tricuspid) and septal annuli velocities is reduced in patients with constrictive pericarditis compared with that in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (and controls) and may be useful to discriminate these groups of patients. In a study of 37 patients with constrictive pericarditis, 35 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (the majority with amyloidosis) and 70 normal controls, the lateral E'/septal E' ratios were 0.94±0.17, 1.35±0.31, and 1.36±0.24, respectively [

         Real-time cine MRI-ventricular septal position and shape during early ventricular filling could distinguish constrictive (n = 18) and inflammatory pericarditis (n = 6) from restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 15) and normal subjects (n = 17). The degree of ventricular coupling, as measured as the difference in the maximal septal excursion between inspiration and expiration, was significantly greater in patients with constrictive pericarditis (20±4.5 percent) and inflammatory pericarditis (14.8±3.2 percent) than in normal subjects (7.0±2.4 percent) and patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (4.2±1.7 percent). A partition value of 11.8 percent completely differentiated constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy [

         In some cases, particularly when there are multiple potential etiologies for heart failure, invasive cardiac catheterization is required to determine the diagnosis. Elevation and equalization of diastolic filling pressures occurs in patients with constrictive pericarditis. Although these hemodynamic findings may occur in patients with other cardiac disorders, their presence is required for the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Diastolic equalization may not be present in patients with constrictive pericarditis in the event of preceding diuresis and a low volume state, as well as in patients with relatively early stage disease. In patients with a low volume state, however, the cardiac output will be low. Therefore, the presence of normal cardiac output with normal filling pressures precludes the presence of hemodynamically significant constrictive pericarditis.

          End-diastolic pressures
         </strong>
         – RV and LV end-diastolic pressures (RVEDP and LVEDP) are equal or nearly equal in constrictive pericarditis, while LVEDP is usually higher than RVEDP in restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, in many cases of restrictive cardiomyopathy the plateau of diastolic pressure is equally elevated in both ventricles, as typically occurs in constrictive pericarditis. If the pressures are approximately equal, a fluid bolus, exercise, or pharmacologic maneuver should theoretically increase LVEDP above RVEDP in restrictive cardiomyopathy, but the data supporting this theory are not convincing [

         ) of ventricular pressure (also called the square root sign) during diastole led investigators to theorize that ventricular filling during early diastole must be unusually rapid and aided by augmented suction, and that ventricular filling must be halted by pericardial restraint from the end of the first third of diastole onward [

          Equalization of pressures

         The pulmonary wedge pressure falls during inspiration while systemic venous pressure remains constant. Thus, it is not reasonable to expect the two pressures to be precisely equal throughout the respiratory cycle, and frequently equilibration is present only during inspiration.

        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In addition, pericardial restraint from a dilated heart may cause equilibration of diastolic pressures and may simulate the hemodynamics of constrictive pericarditis. Examples of this phenomenon are found in RV dilation after RV infarction or severe tricuspid insufficiency, as well as in acute mitral regurgitation secondary to rupture of a chorda tendineae.

         Pulmonary hypertension and LV diastolic pressure that exceeds that in the RV by ≥5 mmHg may favor a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy (restrictive or dilated) rather than constrictive pericarditis. However, neither of these findings is highly specific for either diagnosis [

         Hemodynamic maneuvers, such as exercise, fluid loading, and observing postextrasystolic beats, have been proposed as a way to cause diastolic pressures (equal in the two ventricles) to differ. Published experience with these approaches is limited. In addition, there may not be equalization of diastolic pressures if a patient with constrictive pericarditis has been on diuretics and has low to normal right atrial pressures. In such patients, fluid loading at the time of catheterization is necessary to attempt to confirm the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis.

          Respiratory changes
         </strong>
         – As noted above, both constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy may have similar findings of early rapid diastolic filling and elevation and equalization of diastolic pressures in all four cardiac chambers. However, the respiratory changes in filling of the LV and RV, as well as the enhanced ventricular interaction seen in constrictive pericarditis, result in distinctive changes in the LV and RV pressures during respiration  (

         ). Mirror image discordance, measured as the inspiratory increase in the ratio of areas under the RV and LV systolic pressure curves (systolic area index), was 97 and 100 percent accurate, respectively, for differentiating 59 cases of surgically proven constrictive pericarditis from 41 cases of restrictive cardiomyopathy [

         During inspiration, there is less filling of the LV, resulting in a large fall in LV systolic pressure. The reduction in LV filling is due to the fall in the pulmonary wedge pressure and presumably left atrial pressure resulting from the decrease in intrathoracic pressure. In contrast, left ventricular diastolic pressure does not fall since the LV pressure is shielded from respiratory pressure variations by the pericardial scar. The net effect is a reduction in the pressure gradient for ventricular filling.

         A simplified method to detect enhanced ventricular interaction in the catheterization laboratory using aortic and pulmonic ejection times (ie, surrogates for stroke volumes) has been described [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         ]. Ventricular interaction was assessed by evaluating the difference of aortic and pulmonary artery ejection times from expiration to inspiration. The difference was significant in a 10-patient cohort with surgically proven constrictive pericarditis versus 10 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy or severe tricuspid regurgitation (50.8±22.5 ms versus 5.4±15.2 ms). Although the method is potentially useful, discordant ejection times are not specific for constriction and further validation is needed.

         Ratio of right atrial pressure (RAP) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) – RAP fairly closely approximates pericardial pressure, while PAWP approximates LVEDP (in the absence of mitral stenosis). It has been hypothesized that a larger contribution of pericardial restraint, as shown by a greater RAP/PAWP ratio  (

         ), could help identify patients with "pure" constriction (ie, minimal contribution of myocardial disease to symptoms) in whom pericardiectomy is more likely to be beneficial. In a single-center retrospective study of 113 patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, those with values above the median (mean RAP/PAWP ratio 0.86) had greater pericardial thickness (6.6 versus 4.5 mm) and greater postoperative survival [

         The Doppler myocardial velocity gradient, as measured from the left ventricular (LV) posterior wall in early diastole and during ventricular ejection, was significantly lower in patients with a restrictive cardiomyopathy compared to those with constrictive pericarditis and to normal controls.

         – Right ventricular (RV) and LV end-diastolic pressures (RVEDP and LVEDP) are equal or very nearly equal in constrictive pericarditis, while LVEDP is usually higher than RVEDP in restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, in many cases of restrictive cardiomyopathy the plateau of diastolic pressure is equally elevated in both ventricles as typically occurs in constrictive pericarditis.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the pressures are approximately equal, a fluid bolus, exercise, or pharmacologic maneuver should theoretically increase LVEDP above RVEDP in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Mirror-image discordance between RV and peak LV systolic pressures during inspiration is another sign of increased ventricular interdependence  (

         ); during peak inspiration, an increase in RV pressure occurs when LV pressure is lowest [
