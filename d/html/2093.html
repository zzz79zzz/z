         Eating disorders are characterized by a persistent disturbance of eating behavior that impairs health or psychosocial functioning [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The disorders include anorexia nervosa, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, other specified feeding and eating disorder, unspecified feeding and eating disorder, pica, and rumination disorder. Diagnostic criteria are defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), which divides eating disorders into mutually exclusive categories based upon observed symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Some diagnoses include a dimensional component that allows clinicians to specify the severity of illness [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Sociocultural pressure for thinness may contribute to onset of eating disorders. However, these disorders are increasingly understood to have a biological basis arising from the interaction of individual genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. In addition, physiological consequences of starvation and of disordered eating behavior, disturbances in reward and appetitive neural circuits, and habitual and conditioned learning responses are recognized contributors to the compulsive nature of these disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of eating disorders. Treatment of eating disorders, medical complications of eating disorders and their management, evaluation for medical complications and criteria for hospitalization, and the refeeding syndrome in anorexia nervosa are discussed separately.

         Meta-analyses of data from 94 studies worldwide found that the lifetime prevalence of an eating disorder in females was approximately 8 percent and in males 2 percent [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The most commonly ascertained eating disorder was other specified feeding and eating disorder, followed by binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa. In addition, the point prevalence of all eating disorders appeared to double over the 18-year study period from 2000 to 2018, which may parallel rising rates of obesity worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data from three nationally representative surveys of adults in the United States indicate that the lifetime prevalence of an eating disorder in females is approximately 5 percent and in males 2 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The estimated one-year prevalence rates in females and males were 2 and 1 percent. Lifetime prevalence of any eating disorder was highest among individuals with obesity.

         </span>
         The causes of eating disorders are multifactorial and include a combination of biological, sociocultural, and psychological factors. Genetic risk appears strongest for anorexia nervosa, although bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder also aggregate in families. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa appear highly correlated genetically based on a large Swedish twin study with a genetic correlation for broadly defined anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa of 0.79 and a unique environment correlation of 0.44 [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk factors for eating disorders can be nonspecific and associated with risk for psychiatric illness generally, or specific to eating disorders. Examples of nonspecific risk factors include exposure to physical and/or sexual trauma or problematic parenting behavior [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Following onset of eating disorders, factors that maintain/perpetuate the disorders include physiological and neurobiological complications of starvation and of binge/purge behavior, as well as conditioned learning and habit formation.

          —
         </span>
         For patients with a normal or high body mass index, and no signs or symptoms of eating disorders, the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening for eating disorders [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. It is not known whether screening for eating disorders improves health outcomes [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ], and the evidence is thus lacking to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the harms [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, we suggest screening for eating disorders in primary care patients who are at increased risk of eating disorders, including [

         Screening is important because eating disorders are often undetected and thus untreated [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], and is consistent with practice guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians can screen for eating disorders by asking the patient or family whether they have any concerns about the patient’s weight, body shape, body image, or eating behaviors. In addition, relatively short and easy to interpret instruments that are suitable for screening in a primary care setting have been developed, which may help identify patients who need further evaluation [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,14,15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If screening is implemented, we suggest the SCOFF questionnaire, which is the most commonly used instrument and is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. The SCOFF consists of five clinician-administered questions [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,16
         </a>
         ]:

         Answering “yes” to two or more questions is generally regarded as a positive screen; this cutoff provides good sensitivity and specificity for detecting anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in young females. A positive screen should prompt further assessment to establish or rule out a diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence that supports using the SCOFF includes a meta-analysis of 25 studies with more than 11,000 individuals; the sensitivity was 0.86 and specificity 0.83 [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. However, most studies enrolled young females with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa and employed a case-control design [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the validity of the SCOFF in other populations or for other eating disorder diagnoses, such as binge eating disorder, is not established [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A reasonable alternative to the SCOFF is the clinician-administered, five-item Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care (ESP) [

         ) has been translated in many languages, validated in both clinical and nonclinical groups, and utilized internationally in studies of adolescents and adults. The reliability of the EAT-26 is high; however, low scores cannot be assumed to rule out an eating disorder because denial or minimization of eating disorder symptoms is common. The Ch-EAT is a modified version with simplified language for children age 8 to 13 [

         ]. It provides a categorical diagnosis for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, as well as depressive, anxiety, alcohol, and somatoform disorders. The eating disorder module includes eight items. The instrument was specifically designed for use in primary care, has good diagnostic validity overall (sensitivity 75 percent, specificity 90 percent), excellent diagnostic validity for eating disorders (sensitivity 89 percent, specificity 96 percent), and the median clinician time to review the results is one to two minutes.

          Predisposing factors
         </strong>
         – Predisposing factors in anorexia nervosa include genetic predisposition. As with other psychiatric disorders, genetic influences are likely due to the cumulative, small effects of many distinct genes with pleiotropic effects, many of which influence vulnerability not only to anorexia nervosa but also to psychiatric disorders commonly comorbid with, or observed in relatives of probands with, anorexia nervosa [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. These include anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression, and substance use disorders, as well as bulimia nervosa [

         Additional evidence supporting a genetic basis for anorexia nervosa comes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The first GWAS study included nearly 3500 individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and close to 11,000 controls. This study estimated that the common genetic variant based heritability of anorexia nervosa was approximately 20 percent [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. In addition, positive genetic correlations were noted between anorexia nervosa and neuroticism, perfectionism, schizophrenia, and educational attainment, suggesting that the same genes are involved across these phenotypes. Negative genetic correlations were found with metabolic and anthropometric traits associated with obesity, including high body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin, and fasting glucose.

         Childhood maltreatment is associated with psychiatric problems and may contribute to onset of anorexia nervosa. Several meta-analyses in patients with eating disorders have examined maltreatment before age 18 years. Compared with healthy controls, patients with eating disorders were approximately two to four times more likely to have been abused, depending upon the specific type of abuse [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

          Maintaining factors
         </strong>
         – Restrictive eating in anorexia nervosa initially appears to be rewarding but becomes increasingly compulsive, and may be maintained by aberrant decision making around food choice and by habit formation [

          38,39
         </a>

         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>

         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. However, cross-sectional studies cannot determine whether abnormalities (eg, neuroimaging findings) represent etiologic causes, sequelae, neither, or both. In addition, the study samples are usually small. Some structural and functional changes reverse following weight restoration, while others persist and may represent scar effects that contribute to chronicity.

         Abnormal functioning of corticolimbic reward circuits involved in appetite may contribute to anorexia nervosa. A study examined responses to tasting sucrose in patients recovered from anorexia nervosa (n = 14) and in healthy controls (n = 14); blood flow in the right anterior insula was diminished in the patients, compared with controls [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         A second study scanned 26 females in remission from anorexia nervosa and 22 healthy controls while tasting sucrose or ionic water, either during the fasted or fed state. In the fasted state, females with remitted anorexia nervosa and control females had opposite responses to tastants in the left ventral caudate. The group with remitted anorexia nervosa responded less to tastants in the fasted state than fed state, whereas the controls responded more to tastants in the fasted state than fed state. This finding suggested that anorexia nervosa is characterized by decreased neural sensitivity to the reward value of food taste during hunger, which may facilitate food avoidance in anorexia nervosa [

         Another study compared inpatients with anorexia nervosa (n = 21) to healthy controls (n = 21) while they completed a food choice task in the scanner. Patients with anorexia nervosa were more likely to choose low-fat foods, and activity in the dorsal striatum was greater among patients than controls [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. In addition, connectivity in fronto-striatal circuits differed between groups. The dorsal striatum is involved in habitual behavior, and the study suggests that maladaptive food choices and the avoidance of high-calorie foods in anorexia nervosa can become well-established behaviors subserved by fronto-striatal networks.

         Neurotransmitter systems are also disrupted in anorexia nervosa. Deficits have been found in dopaminergic function, which is thought to be involved with eating behavior, motivation, and reward [

          51

         ]. In the latter study, as well as in a study of underweight inpatients (average age 19) with ARFID treated in an eating disorders behavioral weight restoration program (n = 27), the majority reported food avoidance symptoms related to fear of gastrointestinal consequences of eating. A common symptom was noninduced vomiting [

         </span>
         Although ARFID is a heterogeneous condition, the core clinical feature is restriction in the variety or amount of food consumed, which leads to a persistent failure to meet nutritional and/or energy needs [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Food restriction and/or avoidance is not driven by weight or body shape concerns, as is the case with other eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. Whereas individuals with anorexia nervosa fear weight gain and tend to avoid consuming calorie dense, high-energy foods, those with ARFID often preferentially consume a limited variety of processed, calorie dense, high-energy food.
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors that may be associated with food avoidance in ARFID include lifelong, low appetitive drive; sensory specific aversion to certain foods (taste, texture, temperature, smell, or appearance); or anxiety regarding the consequences of eating (eg, fear of gastrointestinal aversive consequences of eating) [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. In a study of underweight inpatients with ARFID treated in an eating disorders behavioral weight restoration program (n = 27), approximately 80 percent reported food avoidance symptoms related to fear of gastrointestinal consequences of eating [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. A common symptom was noninduced vomiting.
        </p>
        <p>
         ARFID results in caloric and/or micronutrient nutritional insufficiency and the disorder is more severe than the common picky eating seen in children. Patients with ARFID are often underweight, although the disorder can occur at any weight [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Individuals with ARFID often present first to nonpsychiatric specialists, including pediatricians and gastroenterologists, rather than psychiatrists.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients with ARFID, psychiatric comorbidities are common, especially anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder [

          Adolescents
         </strong>
         – A nationally representative survey of adolescents (age 13 to 18 years) in the United States found that the lifetime prevalence of binge eating disorder was 1.6 percent. As with adults, the prevalence was two to three times greater in females than males (2.3 versus 0.8 percent) [

         A genetic component appears to be involved in the etiology of binge eating disorder. One review of twin studies estimated that the proportion of phenotypic variation for binge eating disorder explained by genetic factors (heritability) is 39 to 45 percent [

         Childhood maltreatment is associated with psychiatric problems and may contribute to onset of binge eating disorder. Several meta-analyses in patients with eating disorders have examined maltreatment before age 18 years. Compared with healthy controls, patients with eating disorders were approximately two to four times more likely to have been abused, depending upon the specific type of abuse [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, it is unclear to what extent abuse is involved as a predisposing vulnerability to various eating disorders, or contributes to their onset or exacerbation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the pathogenesis of binge eating disorder is poorly understood, multiple studies have found reduced inhibitory control and higher impulsivity towards salient palatable food stimuli in patients with binge eating disorder, compared to non-binge eating controls with obesity [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62,63
         </a>
         ]. These traits may contribute to the compulsive nature of binge eating behavior and the inability to interrupt a binge. In addition, an increase in reward driven hedonic drive to eat (which overrides homeostatic hunger and satiety signaling) is proposed to contribute to binge behavior [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Neuroimaging studies indicate that compared with overweight or healthy controls, individuals with binge eating disorder are more responsive to food cues and show increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation in reward-related brain regions when presented with food stimuli [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. It is unclear whether this hyper-responsiveness is trait-related or is a consequence of binge eating behavior, which in turn may contribute to maintaining the behavior once established.

         One magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study found evidence of structural brain changes with increased grey matter volumes in the anterior cingulate cortex and the medial orbitofrontal cortex, brain regions involved in reward-learning [

         Binge eating disorder can also be diagnosed according to the criteria in the ICD-11 [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. The ICD-11 criteria closely resemble those of the DSM-5-TR [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, one difference is the requirement in ICD-11 that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another psychiatric disorder (eg, unipolar major depression) or nonpsychiatric disorder (eg, Prader-Willi syndrome).
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of binge eating disorder may change over time. A national registry study of patients with binge eating disorder found that over one year, 16 percent transitioned to another eating disorder diagnosis, most commonly bulimia nervosa or other specified feeding and eating disorder [
         <a href="#rid84">

         The diagnostic stability of adolescent binge eating disorder is low. A prospective study of adolescents (n &gt;1500) found that binge eating disorder at age 14 was associated with bulimia nervosa at age 17, and that binge eating disorder at age 17 was associated with bulimia nervosa at age 20 [

         A genetic component appears to be involved in the etiology of bulimia nervosa. One review of twin studies estimated that the proportion of phenotypic variation for bulimia nervosa explained by genetic factors (heritability) is 28 to 83 percent [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Disinhibition, increased salience of palatable food stimuli, and impairments in emotional self-regulation are characteristic of bulimia nervosa. In addition, an increase in reward driven hedonic drive to eat (which overrides homeostatic hunger and satiety signaling) is proposed to contribute to binge behavior in bulimia nervosa [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Well-established risk factors for bulimia nervosa include sociocultural pressures for thinness, elevated shape and weight concerns, dietary restraint, exercise, and family history of eating and weight control behaviors [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Childhood maltreatment is associated with psychiatric problems and may contribute to onset of bulimia nervosa. Several meta-analyses in patients with eating disorders have examined maltreatment before age 18 years. Compared with healthy controls, patients with eating disorders were approximately two to four times more likely to have been abused, depending upon the specific type of abuse [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, it is unclear to what extent abuse is involved as a predisposing vulnerability to various eating disorders, or contributes to their onset or exacerbation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple studies demonstrate altered brain structure and function in bulimia nervosa [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. As an example, structural and functional neuroimaging studies employing a range of food and body image stimuli suggest abnormalities and dysfunction in brain reward circuitry [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the studies collectively support a relationship between illness severity and neural changes. However, it is not clear whether any of the observed changes are etiologic and lead to bulimia nervosa, or whether the changes represent consequences of the disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown structural brain changes in bulimia nervosa, including frontal and temporoparietal areas:

         One study examined gray and white matter volumes in patients with active bulimia nervosa (n = 20) and in healthy controls (n = 24); after controlling for potential covariates (eg, age, anxiety, depression, and medications), the analyses found that the medial orbitofrontal cortex and antero-ventral insula was larger in patients than controls [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87
         </a>

         A second study compared age matched patients (n = 34) and healthy controls (n = 34), and found that the cerebral surface of the frontal and temporoparietal cortical areas was reduced in patients [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88
         </a>
         ]. In addition, reductions were greater in patients with more episodes of bingeing and purging, more preoccupation with shape and weight, and a longer duration of illness. Reduction of cerebral surfaces was also associated with poorer neuropsychological functioning.

         A study of 62 females with full and subthreshold bulimia nervosa examined subcortical structures associated with reward circuits and found that many structures exhibited localized surface deformations [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89
         </a>
         ]. The deformations were more pronounced in older patients, and were associated with greater symptom severity, suggesting these shape abnormalities may serve as biomarkers of the condition and have prognostic significance.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, abnormal functioning of corticolimbic circuits involved in appetite may contribute to bulimia nervosa. A functional MRI study examined responses to tasting sucrose in patients who recovered from bulimia nervosa (n = 14) and in healthy controls (n = 14); blood flow in the right anterior insula was elevated in the patients, compared with controls [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. This suggests that overeating may occur in bulimia nervosa because hunger and satiety states are not accurately recognized (the anterior insula is thought to integrate sensory aspects of feeding).
        </p>
        <p>
         Further, alterations in hormones and neuropeptides (eg, ghrelin, leptin, and agouti-related peptide) may possibly be involved in the pathogenesis of bulimia nervosa [
