         Spinal cord injury (SCI) produces a wide variety of changes in systemic physiology that can lead to complications over time. Patients with chronic spinal cord dysfunction often require anesthesia for urologic, orthopedic, and plastic surgical procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the purpose of this discussion, chronic injury will be defined as the condition beyond several weeks after injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the anesthetic management of patients with chronic SCI. Anesthesia for patients with acute SCI and the chronic complications of patients with SCI are discussed separately. (See

         A medical history and anesthesia-directed physical examination should be performed for all patients who undergo anesthesia. For these patients, we focus the evaluation on the diverse systemic complications that can occur with SCI and that can affect anesthetic management.

         Chronic complications of SCI of particular concern for anesthesia are discussed here; other complications are discussed more fully separately. (See

         </span>
         Patients with high SCI are at risk for autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and may require deep general anesthesia or regional anesthesia, even without sensory function at the surgical site. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of intraoperative autonomic dysreflexia'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Occurring in 20 to 70 percent of patients with SCI above T6, AD is an exaggerated sympathetic response to a stimulus below the SCI level. AD is manifested by diffuse vasoconstriction below the level of SCI and hypertension producing headache, diaphoresis, brady- or tachycardia, and other symptoms. The noxious stimulus is most commonly a distended viscus, usually the bladder; however, constipation, pain from pressure sores, and other stimuli may be problematic in some patients. SCI lesions lower than T6 do not produce this complication. AD is discussed in more detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4839.html" rel="external">
          "Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease", section on 'Autonomic dysreflexia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A history of AD episodes should be sought preoperatively, including inciting events, treatment regimens, and prior surgical and anesthesia histories.

         Risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are more prevalent in patients with chronic SCI, and the prevalence of CAD is 3 to 10 times higher in patients with SCI compared with the general population [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients with high SCI may exhibit atypical chest pain or other symptoms as a result of cardiac ischemia. Therefore, SCI should lower the threshold to perform preoperative pharmacologic stress testing, especially before major surgery, and these patients should have appropriately aggressive individualized diagnostic workup.

         The autonomic dysfunction that results from SCI disrupts normal cardiovascular homeostasis, separate from AD. In patients with SCI above T6, baseline blood pressure (BP) is usually reduced, and baseline heart rate (HR) may be as low as 50 to 60 beats/minute (bpm) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In addition, these patients are often hypovolemic, and approximately 50 percent are anemic [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A reduction in the dose of anesthetic agents and/or administration of vasoactive medication may be required to avoid hypotension [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Orthostatic hypotension may persist beyond the acute injury phase; these patients may not tolerate quick changes in position during surgery or the head-up position for preoxygenation prior to airway management.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Autonomic dysfunction also results in impaired thermoregulation. Patients are at risk for hypothermia, or for hyperthermia with the use of warming devices [

          Assisted ventilation
         </strong>
         – Patients who retain adequate bulbar function after SCI may require a variety of assisted ventilation techniques, including noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (PPV), mechanical cough assist, glossopharyngeal breathing, and abdominal respirators. A plan for the perioperative management of these devices should be made in advance. (See

         The choice of anesthetic technique depends on the level of SCI, remaining sensory function, and the surgical procedure. Many patients with chronic SCI undergo anesthesia repeatedly; they often have a preference and know what has worked well in the past. In particular, both general and spinal anesthesia can effectively prevent autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in response to surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         General anesthesia may be preferable for patients who cannot tolerate lying flat, who have upper extremity muscle spasms, contractures that make positioning difficult, or high anxiety.

         However, patients with thoracic and cervical SCI are more sensitive to induction agents than non-injured patients and are at risk for hypotension with induction of anesthesia, which may be a result of direct effects of induction agents, hypovolemia [

         After general anesthesia, NMBAs should be fully reversed, documented by a peripheral nerve stimulator. Importantly, neuromuscular monitoring should not be performed on a paralyzed limb. Facial nerve monitoring may be required for patients with high SCI and ulnar nerve paralysis (see

Patients with ventilatory compromise may require bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation (BIPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to support ventilation until they are back to baseline function after anesthesia. Respiratory mechanics may be best in the supine or slightly-head-up position.

         Regional anesthesia is an alternative to general anesthesia for lower abdominal and extremity surgery. Peripheral nerve block may be appropriate for minor procedures on the upper or lower extremities, with the usual indications and contraindications. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/397.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Spinal anesthesia may be used, especially for the urologic procedures that are commonly performed for patients with chronic SCI. Spinal anesthesia can effectively prevent autonomic dysfunction. The level of spinal block may be difficult to determine in patients with high spinal cord lesions, though in practice, a standard dose of spinal drug usually results in an acceptable block. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105456.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Epidural anesthesia is less appropriate than spinal anesthesia for patients with SCI. With epidural anesthesia, sacral anesthesia may be unreliable, and patchy block is possible, especially when there are spinal deformities. There are reports of failure of epidural anesthesia to prevent AD [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         </strong>
         Patients with high thoracic or cervical spinal cord lesions may be hypovolemic and anemic, and may be unable to compensate for even modest blood loss with an increase in sympathetic activity. Preloading with volume prior to induction and diligent replacement of blood loss are important for maintaining adequate cardiac output. Their loss of baroreceptor activity also makes them more susceptible to hypotension with positive pressure ventilation (PPV).

         Patients with SCI are at risk for hypothermia during anesthesia and in a cold operating room (OR) or, less commonly, hyperthermia with overly aggressive warming measures. Temperature should be monitored during and after anesthesia. Warm air blankets and fluid warming should be used intraoperatively and may be continued into the recovery period. (See

         Patients with chronic SCI may require extended recovery room stay to allow for blood pressure (BP), breathing and airway, and temperature stabilization, as well as control of postoperative pain.

         Pregnant patients with high SCI are at risk for autonomic dysreflexia (AD) with distention or irritation of the cervix, vagina, bowel, or bladder during labor contractions. Women with SCI below T11 will be able to perceive labor pain, while those with lesions at T5 to T10 may have painless delivery. Symptoms of AD may be the only signs of labor for patients with high SCI. In addition to malignant hypertension with the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and hypertensive encephalopathy, AD during labor may lead to uteroplacental vasoconstriction and fetal hypoxia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4838.html" rel="external">
          "Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy", section on 'Spinal cord injury'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         These patients should have an antepartum consultation with an anesthesiologist to develop a plan for labor analgesia. Epidural analgesia should be established early or before labor and may be challenging because of contractures, spasms, or prior spine surgery. Continuous spinal, combined spinal-epidural (CSE), and epidural techniques have all been used successfully for parturients at risk for, or who have developed, AD. Patients with SCI above T6 require either general or regional anesthesia for cesarean delivery to prevent AD. Regional anesthesia should be continued in the postpartum period until hemodynamics are stable, as postpartum uterine contractions may elicit an AD response. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101803.html" rel="external">
          "Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumental delivery)"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Monitoring during labor and delivery for parturients with high SCI should include continual blood pressure (BP) and electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. There should be a low threshold to place an arterial catheter to monitor BP; the decision to use invasive BP monitoring must be individualized based on the degree of hemodynamic lability, the progress of labor, the patient's history of AD, and comorbidities.

         Patients with SCI above approximately T6 are at risk for autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which consists of a potentially life-threatening, exaggerated sympathetic response to stimulus below the level of the spinal injury  (
