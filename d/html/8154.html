Patients with severe AS should be referred to a multidisciplinary Heart Valve Team for evaluation and management [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>]. The Heart Valve Team includes clinicians with expertise in the assessment and treatment of valve disease, including cardiologists, specialists in advanced cardiovascular imaging, interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and cardiovascular anesthesiologists. The importance of specialist care was highlighted by an observational study finding an association between cardiac specialist care and lower one-year mortality [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptom status</strong> – Since symptomatic AS is a key indication for AVR, it is useful to determine if the patient with severe AS has cardiac symptoms. Common symptoms in patients followed for AS are dyspnea on exertion, presyncope or syncope, and exertional angina. However, cardiac symptoms are frequent in older adult patients with severe AS and do not necessarily correspond with AS severity [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Many patients with AS have more than one potential cause of cardiac symptoms (eg, coronary artery disease and severe AS). Moreover, among asymptomatic patients with severe AS followed longitudinally, the probability of remaining free of cardiac symptoms while unoperated was only 33 percent at five years [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Evaluation of symptoms in patients with AS is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Symptoms'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Asymptomatic sedentary patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In asymptomatic patients with severe AS, exercise testing is suggested to confirm absence of symptoms, assess exercise tolerance, and assess physiologic changes with exercise (eg, fall in systemic blood pressure with exercise). (See <a class="local">'Exercise testing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severity of AS</strong> – Identification of severe AS (generally by echocardiography) is a key step in determining if a patient is candidate for AVR. Severe high gradient AS is generally identified by an aortic jet velocity over ≥4.0 m/s or mean transvalvular pressure gradient ≥40 mmHg, as well as the typical appearance of the valve with severely reduced leaflet opening  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); an aortic valve area (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8625" href="/d/drug information/8625.html" rel="external">AVA</a>) ≤1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> is typically seen but is not required to identify high gradient severe AS (high gradient severe AS, stage D1). Many patients do not develop symptoms until even more severe valve obstruction is present, while some patients become symptomatic when the stenosis is less severe, particularly if there is coexisting aortic regurgitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8115.html" rel="external">"Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some patients who appear to have severe AS (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8625" href="/d/drug information/8625.html" rel="external">AVA</a> ≤1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) have a low transvalvular gradient (mean gradient &lt;40 mmHg) across the aortic valve; these patients may have low gradient true severe AS or pseudo-severe AS. Diagnosis and evaluation of low gradient severe AS is discussed separately.(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8114.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)</strong> – Assessment of LVEF aids in identifying patients with LV dysfunction who may benefit from AVR. Among patients with severe AS, mortality following AVR increases with even borderline and low normal LV dysfunction (LVEF 50 to 59 percent) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], although major society guidelines have specified LVEF &lt;50 percent as a threshold for intervention [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Indications for valve replacement'</a> below and <a class="local">'Left ventricular systolic dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Evaluation of patents with low flow, low gradient severe AS with LVEF &lt;50 percent is discussed separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8153.html" rel="external">"Estimating the risk of valvular procedures"</a>.)</p><p>Procedural morbidity and mortality for TAVI also vary depending upon patient and institutional factors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110074.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Complications"</a>.)</p><p>The presence of a prosthetic heart valve is also associated with appreciable long-term morbidity. Among the complications of prosthetic heart valves are prosthesis dysfunction, paravalvular leak, thrombus formation, thromboembolism, endocarditis, and the problems associated with anticoagulation. The incidence of serious complications depends upon the type of valve and a number of clinical variables, but significant complications occur at a frequency of approximately 3 percent per year, and death due directly to the valve occurs at the rate of approximately 1 percent per year [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>].</p><p>Recommendations for surgical valve replacement for AS are based largely upon comparisons of the natural history of patients with AS to outcomes after SAVR, as discussed below  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83004" href="/d/graphic/83004.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8165.html" rel="external">"Natural history, epidemiology, and prognosis of aortic stenosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8143.html" rel="external">"Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement"</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations for TAVI for AS are based upon randomized trial and observational study data, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">"Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Symptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, symptomatic severe AS is an indication for valve replacement based on evidence showing a beneficial effect on survival  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83004" href="/d/graphic/83004.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Exertional dyspnea, presyncope/syncope, and angina are the primary symptoms in patients with severe AS. Natural history studies have shown that average survival after the onset of these symptoms is only two to three years. There is a high risk of sudden death in symptomatic patients who are followed conservatively [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Although randomized trials comparing surgery with continued medical therapy have not been performed, observational studies have found that corrective surgery in this setting is followed by symptomatic improvement and a substantial increase in survival [<a href="#rid1">1,14-20</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of benefit from AVR in patients with symptomatic AS is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective review of 99 older adults with AS, almost all in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV, follow-up at 55 months revealed that 91 percent of survivors were in NYHA class I or II  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective study of 144 symptomatic patients, survival at three years was 87 percent in 125 who underwent valve replacement compared with 21 percent in 19 nonoperated patients [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p>A limitation of such retrospective observational studies is that the better outcomes with surgery in symptomatic AS could be at least partly due to selection bias (ie, healthier patients are chosen for surgery). However, the magnitude of difference in outcomes between medically managed patients and those undergoing surgical valve replacement is greater than would be expected based upon patient selection alone.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recommendations for valve replacement in patients with severe AS are based upon consideration of the relative risks of valve replacement and medical therapy.</p><p>The risk of morbidity and mortality with AVR varies widely. If a patient's estimated procedural mortality (with SAVR or TAVI) is not under 2 to 3 percent, then the operative risk may exceed the risk (1 percent per year) of sudden death in an asymptomatic patient who does not undergo surgery. Furthermore, valve replacement does not abolish the risk of sudden death. Thus, even if surgical mortality can be minimized, the combined risk of valve replacement and the late complications of a prosthetic valve may exceed the possibility of preventing sudden death in some asymptomatic patients with severe AS.</p><p>Contemporary data on asymptomatic patients with AS undergoing SAVR show low operative mortality and substantial rates of event-free survival, especially in younger low-risk patients. In an observational study of patients ≥60 years old undergoing SAVR from 2001 to 2017 (with risk stratified by EuroSCORE or EuroSCORE II), the 30-day mortality was 1.2 percent for low-risk patients, 4.1 percent for intermediate-risk patients, and 8.3 percent for high-risk patients [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Median survival time was 10.9 years in low-risk patients, 7.3 years in intermediate-risk patients, and 5.8 years in high-risk patients.</p><p>A meta-analysis comparing early SAVR to conservative management included two randomized controlled trials and 10 observational studies with a total of 4130 patients with asymptomatic severe AS [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early SAVR was associated with lower all-cause mortality (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.35-0.45), cardiovascular mortality (pooled OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.56), and heart failure hospitalization (pooled OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10-0.39) than conservative management. However, the risk of stroke (pooled OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.73-2.29) and myocardial infarction (pooled OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.19-1.27) were similar with early SAVR and conservative management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A limitation of this analysis is that patients receiving conservative management in the observational studies were older, sicker, and thus had greater risk of surgical complications. However, analysis limited to the two randomized trials [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>] also showed lower all-cause mortality with early SAVR (pooled OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.82).</p><p></p><p>The results of these studies in asymptomatic patients with AS, as well as the high likelihood of symptoms developing during follow-up [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], should be taken into consideration in assessment of the asymptomatic patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1561356966"><span class="h3">Left ventricular systolic dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with depressed LVEF and severe AS, observational data suggest that survival is better in those undergoing AVR compared with those treated medically [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. However, mortality following AVR increases with even borderline and low normal LV dysfunction (LVEF 50 to 59 percent) compared with LVEF ≥60 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The depressed LVEF in many patients is caused by excessive afterload that is corrected by valve replacement [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Diastolic dysfunction improves later when hypertrophy and fibrosis regress [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>In patients with severely depressed LV systolic function (ie, LVEF of 20 to 35 percent), symptoms and survival are still improved by valve replacement, although symptoms may not completely resolve [<a href="#rid15">15,26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h3">Very severe AS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For asymptomatic patients with very severe AS and low estimated procedural risk (with SAVR or TAVI), we suggest early AVR since symptom onset and adverse outcomes are likely within the next year. The randomized controlled RECOVERY trial found that early SAVR improved survival compared with conservative care [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The trial enrolled asymptomatic patients with very severe AS (defined as an aortic valve area [<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8625" href="/d/drug information/8625.html" rel="external">AVA</a>] of ≤0.75 cm<sup>2</sup> with a maximum aortic velocity ≥ 4.5 m/s or a mean transvalvular pressure gradient ≥50 mmHg) with low operative risk, with 73 randomly assigned to early surgery (within two months of randomization) and 72 patients randomly assigned to conservative care with close follow-up. The mean patient age was 64 years.

Also, this study is limited by the small number of deaths from any cause during this trial (five in the early surgery group and 15 in the conservative care group).

An abnormal test result (such as development of symptoms with exercise, a drop or ≤20 mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure, or significant ventricular arrhythmias) or the inability to achieve the workload expected for age and sex suggests an increased risk of adverse events with conservative management.</p><p>The presence of a physician is generally suggested during stress testing [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

Scant data are available on which exercise text abnormality has greatest prognostic value, but some studies suggest that exercise-induced symptoms have greater prognostic value that abnormal blood pressure response or ST-segment abnormalities [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Due to the combination of LV hypertrophy and diminished coronary flow reserve, the development of ST depression during exercise is a common finding in adults with asymptomatic AS and is not specific for the presence of CAD [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>The ability of exercise testing to identify asymptomatic patients with severe AS who are likely to develop adverse events was illustrated by a meta-analysis of data from seven studies with a total of 491 patients (mean age 50 to 66 years) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An abnormal stress test result was defined as development of symptoms such as dyspnea, angina, syncope, or near syncope during exercise; a decrease in blood pressure or a &lt;20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure during exercise; &lt;80 percent of normal exercise tolerance; OR ≥2 mm horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression during exercise.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with normal stress test results, no sudden deaths were observed after one year of follow-up.

A similar recommendation is included in the 2021 European Society of Cardiology valve guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Thus, nearly all adults with an indication for valve replacement for AS require coronary angiography prior to valve intervention. Significant CAD is common in patients with AS, with approximately 40 percent of those undergoing surgical valve replacement for AS requiring concurrent CABG [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Many patients with severe AS have angina, but this symptom can be caused by CAD or AS alone. Thus, symptoms do not predict the presence or absence of concurrent coronary disease, and the electrocardiogram and noninvasive stress testing may be nondiagnostic in patients with LV hypertrophy [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

Catheterization is appropriate if there is a discrepancy between clinical and echocardiographic examinations with regard to the severity of the stenosis or if echocardiographic data are nondiagnostic [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. There is a risk of cerebral embolization associated with crossing the aortic valve in patients with severe calcific AS; as a result, this approach should be avoided whenever possible.

Patients with angina, documented ischemia, or prior history of CAD should proceed directly to invasive coronary angiography rather than CCTA. If any epicardial CAD is detected by CCTA, invasive coronary angiography is required for confirmation and to guide potential revascularization.

The ability of coronary CCTA with a 64-slice scanner to exclude significant CAD was investigated in 70 patients referred for cardiac valve surgery, 31 of whom had AS [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The prevalence of significant CAD, defined as the presence of at least one lesion with stenosis diameter of ≥50 percent, was 26 percent.

However, interpretation of the data is complex since patients with AS and CAD who undergo concomitant SAVR and CABG have higher short- and long-term mortality rates than patients with isolated AS (without significant CAD) who undergo AVR, likely due to higher baseline risk [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The utility of a hybrid approach (PCI plus SAVR) in selected patients who are not candidates for internal mammary bypass grafting is uncertain [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>Strategies for revascularization in patients with CAD undergoing TAVI are evolving. Observational studies suggest that for patients with AS and CAD undergoing TAVI, a strategy of selective PCI yields outcomes similar to those for patients with AS without CAD undergoing TAVI [<a href="#rid41">41-43</a>]. In one series of 263 patients managed undergoing TAVI and revascularized according to heart team consensus, incomplete and complete revascularization by PCI yielded similar outcomes.

In addition, SAVR is suggested for patients with moderate AS who are undergoing other cardiac surgery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The decision to proceed with concomitant AVR in patients with moderate AS is based upon consideration the natural history of the disease. Studies in which serial testing was performed have identified two groups of patients: one in which there is a decrease in effective valve area of 0.1 to as much as 0.3 cm<sup>2</sup> per year; and one comprising more than one-half of patients in which there is little or no progression over a three- to nine-year period. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8165.html" rel="external">"Natural history, epidemiology, and prognosis of aortic stenosis", section on 'Progression of aortic stenosis'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, some patients with moderate AS who undergo only CABG will progress to severe AS. Valve replacement at this later time is usually associated with a higher risk of mortality than initially combined surgery. In two series with a total of 229 patients who underwent AVR after prior CABG, the early mortality rate was 13 percent [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]. In one of these series, postoperative complications included worsening heart failure in 35 percent and perioperative myocardial infarction in 13 percent, but long-term outcome in survivors was favorable [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].
