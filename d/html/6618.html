Overall, the psychotherapies compared with a control intervention were effective for BPD-relevant outcomes (eg, a combination of BPD symptom change, self-harm, and suicide combined) at post-test (g = 0.35, 95% CI 0.2-0.5) and at follow-up (g = 0.45, 95% CI 0.15-0.75). DBT (g = 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.53) and psychodynamic approaches (g = 0.41, 95% CI 0.12-0.69) were the specific types of psychotherapy that were found to be more effective than control interventions for BPD-relevant outcomes at post-test, but not at follow-up.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another meta-analysis of 14 trials with 1370 participants, the effects of psychotherapy (eg, CBT, interpersonal therapy, or psychodynamic therapy) versus control on quality of life (QoL) and level of BPD pathology in patients with BPD was examined [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Psychotherapies for BPD showed improvements in QoL (effect size d = 0.31, 95% CI 0.18-0.44) and BPD pathology (effect size d = 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.64). While positive effects were noted, effect sizes were small to moderate and more studies are needed to examine the impact of psychotherapy on QoL and long-term outcome.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1051571019"><span class="h2">Specific psychotherapies</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H470487746"><span class="h3">Dialectical behavior therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>DBT is a well-studied, evidence-based variation of CBT that includes an emphasis on behaviorally analyzing and managing a hierarchy of treatment targets, including suicidal/dangerous behavior, treatment-interfering behavior, and QoL interfering behavior. It consists of weekly individual psychotherapy with a DBT-trained therapist and group skills training utilizing evidence-based skills and interventions as delineated in the DBT skills manual for approximately one year [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>The therapists treating these patients are expected to attend a regular consultation group to discuss issues and problems inherent in the treatment as well as to ensure that the therapy remains adherent to treatment principles. Another core feature of DBT is the availability of the therapist by phone or other means between sessions to provide coaching in the context of target behavior management and to facilitate the generalization of skills from therapy sessions to the natural environment.</p><p>As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 101 women with BPD and self-injurious behavior to receive DBT or community treatment over a two-year period of treatment and follow-up. Over the two-year period, fewer patients treated with DBT attempted suicide (23 versus 46 percent), used hospital emergency department services (43 versus 58 percent), or required psychiatric hospitalization (20 versus 49 percent) compared with patients receiving community treatment [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Fewer patients assigned to DBT dropped out of treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3591097979"><span class="h3">Mentalization-based therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mentalization-based therapy is primarily a psychodynamic therapy that also incorporates cognitive techniques. Patients are taught to observe their state of mind at each moment, and to generate alternative perspectives of subjective experiences of themselves and others.</p><p>Randomized trials have found that BPD patients treated with mentalization-based therapy improved on multiple BPD outcomes compared with control conditions [<a href="#rid13">13,15</a>]. As an example, a trial randomly assigned 41 BPD patients to receive mentalization-based treatment or general outpatient psychiatric care. Patients in the experimental group received individual and group therapy in a partial hospital setting for 18 months, followed by an additional 18 months of outpatient treatment twice a week [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Eight years after intake for the trial, significantly fewer patients in the experimental group attempted suicide (23 versus 74 percent) or met criteria for BPD (14 versus 87 percent) compared with patients in the control group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2649772271"><span class="h3">Transference-focused therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transference-focused therapy is a psychodynamic psychotherapy that involves exploration, confrontation, and transference interpretations of emotionally charged issues that arise in the relationship between the patient and therapist. The aim is to correct the patient's tendency to perceive significant others in a distorted manner.</p><p>Randomized trials of transference-focused therapy for BPD have found the therapy to be efficacious compared with a control condition but less effective than another psychotherapy developed for BPD:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A clinical trial of 104 women with BPD found that transference-focused therapy over one year reduced BPD symptoms, improved psychosocial functioning, and reduced suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations compared with treatment by an experienced community psychotherapist [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Schema-focused versus transference-focused therapy – A three-year randomized trial found that schema-focused therapy resulted in a greater proportion of BPD patients achieving remission of BPD symptoms compared with transference-focused therapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Schema-focused therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In our clinical experience, transference-focused therapy can be helpful to patients with BPD particularly among those patients who are functioning fairly well in their lives. Further trials are needed to determine its efficacy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1918816662"><span class="h3">"Good psychiatric management"</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>“Good psychiatric management” is a manualized treatment developed to address shortages of mental health professionals, particularly those with training and experience in treating severe personality disorders [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. It is intended for use by “generalist” clinicians, without expertise, including non-mental health practitioners. Compared with the other therapies listed here, this approach involves less of a distinct conceptual model and less specified psychotherapeutic techniques. Instead, it provides a set of principles and practices to meet the patient’s clinical needs and assist the general psychiatrist in avoiding many of the pitfalls that can occur in the treatment of BPD. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnostic disclosure and psychoeducation about the disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active case management with focus upon the patient’s life outside of therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Goal setting and focusing on best ways to achieve them in order to convey that change is expected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Focusing on the individual’s interpersonal hypersensitivity (eg, tendency to attach more meaning to trivial interpersonal interactions than warranted) in order to better understand their behavior; teaching how the disorder impacts relationships and how to acquire skills to better manage emotions within those relationships.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of multiple treatment modalities (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous) if indicated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Flexibility with regard to treatment duration and intensity.</p><p></p><p>A randomized trial compared “good psychiatric management” with DBT, a well-regarded, widely-studied intervention, in 180 outpatients with BPD [<a href="#rid27">27</a>] and found that outcomes did not differ significantly between good psychiatric management and DBT. Patients received weekly treatment for one year. Therapists for both groups received weekly supervision. Both therapies, as delivered in the study, were assessed by patients and audiotape reviewers, and found to be adherent to their respective treatment models. Sixty-two percent of patients completed the year of treatment, with no difference in retention between groups. At the end of one year, both groups experienced reductions in suicidal and self-injurious episodes, BPD symptoms, and improved functioning; no difference was seen between groups. Treatment gains were found to be sustained in both groups at two-year follow-up [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. These results would benefit from further study in a well-powered, “noninferiority” trial. In our clinical experience, good psychiatric management is an effective approach to treatment of BPD. (See <a class="local">'Dialectical behavior therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT employs cognitive therapies to address the patient’s distorted cognitions about themselves and others, and uses behavioral strategies improve social and emotional functioning.</p><p>Several randomized trials comparing CBT (or cognitive therapies) with a control condition in patients with BPD have found mixed results for primary outcomes, including self-injurious behavior [<a href="#rid12">12,29-32</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A trial randomly assigned 30 BPD patients, who were engaged in self-harm activities and receiving treatment as usual, to receive manual-assisted cognitive treatment (MACT) or to a control condition [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Patients receiving MACT experienced less frequent self-harm at the intervention’s completion compared with the control group; self-harm was less frequent and severe in the MACT group at six-month posttreatment follow-up. No difference was seen between groups in suicidal ideation and time to self-harm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The largest of the trials randomly assigned 106 patients with BPD to either CBT (a median of 31 sessions) plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone for 12 months [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. No difference was seen in the primary outcome – a composite measure comprised of suicidal acts, psychiatric hospital admissions, and emergency center visits. The mean number of suicidal acts, a secondary outcome, was lower in the CBT group compared with the control group (0.9 versus 1.7).</p><p></p><p>It is not clear whether the mixed results from the trials reflect the efficacy of CBT for BPD or other factors, such as heterogeneity among the CBT interventions and other cognitive interventions studied.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2614081356"><span class="h3">Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>STEPPS is an effective, CBT-oriented group therapy that includes skills training and family education [<a href="#rid29">29,33</a>]. STEPPS is primarily used as an adjunct to non-CBT-oriented psychotherapies but has also been used adjunctive to DBT.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H118367845"><span class="h3">Schema-focused therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Schema-focused therapy combines CBT and psychodynamic techniques with the aim of modifying maladaptive schemas. Schemas are mental structures that represent some aspect of the world such as oneself or others that are rooted in childhood experiences, and that are used to organize knowledge of the surrounding world.</p><p>Clinical trials have found schema-focused therapy to be an effective treatment for BPD [<a href="#rid11">11,34</a>]. Furthermore, combined individual and group schema therapy (IGST) appears to be superior to predominantly group schema therapy (PGST) or treatment as usual. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A clinical trial of 32 randomly assigned patients with BPD compared an eight-month, 30-session schema-focused group therapy with treatment as usual [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Schema-focused therapy led to reduced BPD symptoms and improved global functioning, with a much larger proportion of patients no longer meeting BPD diagnostic criteria by the end of the trial compared with the control group (16 versus 94 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Schema-focused versus transference-focused therapy – A three-year randomized trial found that schema-focused therapy resulted in a greater proportion of BPD patients achieving remission of BPD symptoms compared with transference-focused therapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Transference-focused therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a multisite, international trial, 495 individuals with BPD were randomly assigned to treatment over a two-year period with PGST, combined IGST, or treatment as usual (eg, frequently DBT) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. At treatment end, individuals in the combined IGST group showed greater improvement on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index-IV than those in the treatment as usual group or the PGST group (Cohen’s d 1.14, 95% CI 0.57-1.71 and 0.84, 95% CI 0.09-1.59, respectively). Treatment retention was greater in the IGST arm than the PGST arm or the treatment as usual arm at both one and two years. Group and individual sessions appear to ameliorate different patient problems, with group therapy addressing social and work functioning, and individual therapy reducing suicide attempts.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H540950333"><span class="h2">Duration and intensity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The psychotherapies used in the clinical trials above were mostly designed to be delivered one or two times weekly for 6 to 12 months; some included additional group sessions. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy of psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Our clinical experience is that many, if not most, BPD patients require many months to years of treatment, which is consistent with the course of the disorder, severity of associated mood and behavioral problems, and the long-term process of achieving sustained insight, self-control, and improved occupational and social functioning. While some suggest a minimum of 20 sessions [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>], we believe that the ability to maintain a consistent relationship with a therapist over many months and, in many cases, years helps the patient appreciate and work through the problems and interpersonal difficulties that are inherent in maintaining any long-term relationship. Patients (especially younger patients) with fewer and less severe symptoms, fewer comorbid conditions, less psychosocial impairment, and better interpersonal relatedness are likely to have better outcomes even with more limited treatment interventions.</p><p>The intensity of treatment varies with fluctuations in the severity of symptoms and associated risks. During acute periods of severe illness, the patient may require a brief inpatient stay (eg, to prevent suicidal behavior), participation in a partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient program, or multiple outpatient sessions weekly. Less frequent outpatient treatment may be needed during periods of mild symptoms and greater stability.</p><p>The decision to stop treatment optimally is made jointly by the patient and clinician. It is typically advisable to continue therapy until safety has been maintained for an extended period and sufficient progress has been achieved in reducing the patient’s symptoms and functional impairment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3895370387"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
