Surgical pelvic anatomy from a vaginal approach and the surgical anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14186.html" rel="external">"Surgical female urogenital anatomy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3.html" rel="external">"Anatomy of the abdominal wall"</a>.)</p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the gender terms as they are used in the studies presented.

A sagittal view of the female pelvis is shown in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82998" href="/z/d/graphic/82998.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The anatomy of the lower genital tract, comprised of the vulva and vagina, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14186.html" rel="external">"Surgical female urogenital anatomy", section on 'Lower genital tract'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506230"><span class="h2">Uterus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The uterus includes the uterine corpus and uterine cervix  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921" href="/z/d/graphic/55921.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In reproductive age women, the corpus is much larger than the cervix while, during the prepubertal and postmenopausal stages, they are of similar sizes. However, the size of the uterus can vary considerably, depending upon hormonal levels, previous parturition, or the presence of uterine pathology (eg, fibroids, adenomyosis)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80897" href="/z/d/graphic/80897.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H821891"><span class="h3">Uterine corpus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The corpus, or body, of the uterus has an inverted triangular shape  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82997" href="/z/d/graphic/82997.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The most superior portion is called the fundus and the most inferior portion that is continuous with the cervix is called the isthmus, or the lower uterine segment. There are no anatomic landmarks that divide these portions from the rest of the uterine corpus. The uterus is made up of three layers:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endometrium</strong> – The endometrium is the lining of the uterine cavity, with a superficial layer that consists of glandular epithelium and stroma. The thickness of the endometrium changes with the menstrual cycle or other hormonal stimulation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7418.html" rel="external">"Normal menstrual cycle"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myometrium</strong> – The myometrium is the thickest layer of the uterus. It is composed of smooth muscle fibers that are oriented diagonally and crisscross with fibers from the contralateral side of the uterus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serosa</strong> – The serosa is the thin outer lining layer of the uterus, investing the body of the uterus, consisting of visceral peritoneum.</p><p></p><p>Congenital anomalies of the uterus are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5418.html" rel="external">"Congenital uterine anomalies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506237"><span class="h3">Uterine cervix</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cervix is a tubular structure that serves as the conduit between the endometrial cavity and the vagina. The superior portion is continuous with the uterus. During surgery, the junction between the uterine corpus and cervix can be located by palpating the area to feel the superior border of the cervix, which is tubular and bulky compared with the uterus.</p><p>The inferior portion of the cervix protrudes into the vagina. In some women (eg, postmenopausal, following pelvic radiation), the cervix may appear flush with the vagina on examination rather than protruding.</p><p>The cervical canal opens into the endometrial cavity at the internal os and into the vagina at the external os. The ectocervix is the surface of the cervix that protrudes into the vagina.</p><p>The cervix is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue with a minimal amount of smooth muscle located on the periphery that forms a continuous layer between the myometrium and the muscle in the vaginal wall.</p><p>The endocervical canal is lined with glandular epithelium. This transforms into stratified squamous epithelium on the ectocervix due to exposure to the acidic environment that is present in the vagina after menarche. The area where the epithelium changes from glandular to squamous is known as the transformation zone and is the area of the cervix that is most susceptible to dysplasia and malignant transformation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The anterior cervix is apposed to the bladder, while the lateral aspects of the cervix are covered by the broad ligament. The posterior aspect of the cervix forms part of the anterior boundary of the pelvic posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H821942"><span class="h3">Uterine support structures</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16592485"><span class="h4">Uterosacral and cardinal ligament complex</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The uterosacral/cardinal ligament complex suspends the uterus and upper vagina in its normal orientation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It serves to maintain vaginal length and keep the vaginal axis nearly horizontal in a standing woman so that it can be supported by the levator plate. Loss of this support contributes to prolapse of the uterus and/or vaginal apex.</p><p>The cardinal ligaments are condensations of connective tissue that are several centimeters in width and run from the cervix and upper vagina to the pelvic sidewall. The uterine vessels run for much of their course within the cardinal ligaments.</p><p>The uterosacral ligaments are bands of connective tissue that are fused with the cardinal ligaments at their point of insertion in the cervix. The uterosacral ligaments pass posteriorly and inferiorly to attach to the ischial spine and sacrum [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506251"><span class="h4">Round ligaments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The round ligaments are extensions of the uterine musculature. They begin at the uterine fundus anterior and inferior to the fallopian tubes  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83000" href="/z/d/graphic/83000.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63463" href="/z/d/graphic/63463.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>), travel retroperitoneally through the layers of the broad ligament, then enter the inguinal canal, and terminate in the labia majora. The male homolog of the round ligaments is the gubernaculum testis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16592458"><span class="h4">Broad ligament</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The broad ligament covers the lateral uterine corpus and upper cervix. The boundaries of the broad ligament are: superiorly, the round ligaments; posteriorly, the infundibulopelvic ligaments; and inferiorly, the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments. It consists of anterior and posterior leaves that separate to enclose viscera and blood vessels. Structures within the broad ligament are considered retroperitoneal. Dissection between these leaves is necessary to provide exposure of these structures.</p><p>Various portions of the broad ligament are named for nearby structures (ie, the mesosalpinx [located near the fallopian tubes] and the mesovarium [located near the ovary]).</p><p>The broad ligament is composed of visceral and parietal peritoneum that contains smooth muscle and connective tissue.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H821997"><span class="h4">Endopelvic fascia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pelvic viscera are covered by endopelvic fascia, a connective tissue layer that provides support to the pelvic organs, yet allows for their mobility to permit storage of urine and stool, coitus, parturition, and defecation.</p><p>Histologically, endopelvic fascia is composed of collagen, elastin, adipose tissue, nerves, vessels, lymph channels, and smooth muscle.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506258"><span class="h2">Adnexa</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The uterine adnexa consist of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506272"><span class="h3">Ovary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ovaries are suspended lateral and/or posterior to the uterus, depending upon the position of the patient. The supporting structures of the ovaries include the utero-ovarian ligament that attaches the ovary to the uterus; the infundibulopelvic ligament (also referred to as the suspensory ligament of the ovary), through which the ovarian vessels travel, that attaches the ovary to the pelvic sidewall; and the broad ligament, which condenses to form the mesovarium. It is also attached to the broad ligament through the mesovarium.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During hysterectomy, if the ovaries are conserved, the utero-ovarian ligament is transected. If salpingo-oophorectomy is performed, the infundibulopelvic ligaments (with the ovarian vessels) are ligated  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63463" href="/z/d/graphic/63463.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3311.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy: Abdominal (open) route", section on 'Adnexal conservation or removal'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The ovary consists of an outer cortex, where the ova and follicles are located, and medulla, where the blood vessels and connective tissue compose a fibromuscular tissue layer  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77045" href="/z/d/graphic/77045.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H346987"><span class="h3">Fallopian tube</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The fallopian tubes arise from the uterine corpus posterior and superior to the round ligaments. The broad ligaments support the tubes with a condensation of connective tissue called the mesosalpinx. Paratubal cysts may develop within the mesosalpinx; these are often remnants of the mesonephric or paramesonephric ducts that form and then resorb during embryologic development. The lumen of the fallopian tubes communicates with the uterine cavity and the intraabdominal cavity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3204.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Differential diagnosis", section on 'Paraovarian/paratubal cysts and tubal and broad ligament neoplasms'</a>.)</p><p>Each tube is divided into four distinct portions: the interstitial portion, where the tube passes through the uterine cornu; the isthmus, with a narrow lumen and thick muscular wall; the ampulla, with a larger lumen and mucosal folds; and the fimbria, located at the end of the tube with frond-like projections that increase the surface area of the end of the tubes, thereby facilitating contact with ovulated ova  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921" href="/z/d/graphic/55921.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The fallopian tubes consist of an outer muscularis layer of the tube with longitudinal smooth muscle fibers and an inner layer with circular fibers. The fallopian tube mucosa is composed of numerous delicate papillary folds (plica) consisting of three cell types: ciliated columnar cells; nonciliated, columnar secretory cells; and intercalated cells, which may simply represent inactive secretory cells [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506286"><span class="h1">VASCULATURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The aorta provides the blood supply to the pelvic structures. The aorta bifurcates at approximately vertebrae L4 to L5 into the right and left common iliac arteries.</p><p>The inferior vena cava, where the right and common iliac veins return their blood flow, is located to the right of the aortic bifurcation. Compression of these veins while packing the bowels during abdominal surgery may cause the patient's blood pressure to drop because of the decreased venous return.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506293"><span class="h2">Common and external iliac vessels</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The common iliac arteries divide into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries; the internal iliac artery is also referred to as the hypogastric artery. The left common iliac vein travels anterior to the sacrum and medial to the aortic bifurcation and joins the right common iliac vein to form the vena cava posterior to the right common iliac artery.</p><p>The external iliac artery is located medial to the psoas muscle; it continues its course inferiorly to ultimately become the femoral artery. In the pelvis, the external artery gives off several branches, including the inferior epigastric artery; recurrent obturator artery; and the deep circumflex iliac artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83008" href="/z/d/graphic/83008.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>The external iliac vein is much larger and lies posterior and medial to the artery. The external iliac vein also covers the obturator fossa, where the obturator neurovascular bundle and lymph nodes are located medial to the obturator internus muscle.</p><p>The umbilicus is the location on the abdominal wall with the shortest distance from skin to peritoneum. Therefore, it is commonly used as the entry point for the first trocar insertion during laparoscopy. The bifurcation of the aorta can be located directly underneath the umbilicus with those with a normal body mass index, to 3 to 4 cm caudal to the umbilicus in the patient with obesity.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During laparoscopy, in the thin patient, placement of the initial umbilical trocar or Veress needle should be performed at a 30 to 45 degree angle to the anterior abdominal wall in order to avoid injury to the common iliac vessels or the aorta. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Major vessels'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506300"><span class="h2">Inferior and superficial epigastric vessels</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The inferior epigastric vessels perfuse the rectus abdominis muscles. The inferior epigastric artery originates from the external iliac artery, travels through the transversalis fascia into a space between the rectus muscle and posterior sheath  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81343" href="/z/d/graphic/81343.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). In their course from the lateral position of the external iliac vessels, the inferior epigastric artery and vein run obliquely toward a more medial location as they approach the umbilicus.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When a muscle-splitting technique is used during laparotomy (eg, Maylard), care must be taken to ensure hemostasis of the inferior epigastric vessels, which may retract quickly when the muscle is transected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2.html" rel="external">"Incisions for open abdominal surgery", section on 'Maylard's incision'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The superficial epigastric vessels perfuse the anterior abdominal wall. These vessels run from the femoral vessels and branch extensively as they approach the umbilicus.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When lower abdominal lateral ports are placed during laparoscopy, the inferior and superficial epigastric vessels should be identified to avoid vascular injury. The superficial epigastric vessels can be seen by transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall, with the exception of some patients with obesity. The inferior epigastric vessels must be visualized intraabdominally where they run lateral to the medial umbilical ligaments  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83000" href="/z/d/graphic/83000.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88846.html" rel="external">"Complications of laparoscopic surgery", section on 'Minor vessels'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3.html" rel="external">"Anatomy of the abdominal wall"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506307"><span class="h2">Anterior and posterior divisions of the internal iliac artery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The internal iliac artery (hypogastric artery) branches into the anterior and posterior divisions.</p><p>The posterior division travels toward the ischial spine, branching into the lateral sacral, iliolumbar, and superior gluteal arteries. The anterior division of the internal iliac artery branches into the obliterated umbilical, uterine, superior vesical, obturator, vaginal, and inferior gluteal and internal pudendal arteries  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83008" href="/z/d/graphic/83008.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The internal iliac vein lies medial to the internal iliac artery, while the other veins travel with their corresponding arteries.</p><p>The internal iliac artery is a retroperitoneal structure and to identify and access any of its branches of interior iliac artery, a retroperitoneal dissection must be performed. In addition, the ureter runs retroperitoneally in this region, and should be identified prior to the vessel desiccation or ligation of any vessel.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ligation of the hypogastric artery is a useful surgical technique to control massive pelvic hemorrhage  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83009" href="/z/d/graphic/83009.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). Following hypogastric artery ligation, collateral flow from the aortic branches (ie, lumbar and middle sacral artery) or through the inferior mesenteric branches (ie, superior hemorrhoidal vessels) prevents ischemia of the pelvic organs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3302.html" rel="external">"Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery", section on 'Internal iliac artery ligation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25506314"><span class="h2">Blood supply to the uterus, tubes, and ovaries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of the blood supply to the uterus, tubes, and ovaries derives from the uterine arteries and the ovarian arteries.</p><p>The uterine arteries originate from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries in the retroperitoneum  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58377" href="/z/d/graphic/58377.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). They may share a common origin with the obliterated umbilical artery, internal pudendal, or vaginal artery. In the fetus, the pattern of oxygen delivery through the umbilical artery and vein is reversed from the usual pattern.
