         Hypogonadism in a male refers to a decrease in one or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production or testosterone production. These abnormalities can result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the hypothalamus or pituitary (secondary hypogonadism). The distinction between these disorders, which will be described below, is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The patient has primary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration and/or the sperm count are below normal and the serum LH and/or FSH concentrations are above normal.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The patient has secondary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration and/or the sperm count are below normal and the serum LH and/or FSH concentrations are normal or low.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In primary hypogonadism, spermatogenesis tends to be impaired to a greater degree than Leydig cell function, at least in its early stages. In contrast, both functions are impaired to the same degree in secondary hypogonadism  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97670" href="/z/d/graphic/97670.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Spermatogenesis cannot be increased in men with primary hypogonadism, because of damage to the seminiferous tubules. However, successful pregnancies have now been reported with men with primary hypogonadism, including men with Klinefelter syndrome, using sperm extracted from the testes with subsequent in vitro fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7452.html" rel="external">
          "Treatments for male infertility", section on 'Retrieval of sperm'
         </a>
         ). In contrast, treatment with gonadotropins can often restore spermatogenesis in men with secondary hypogonadism. (See

         The clinical features of male hypogonadism depend upon the age of onset, severity of testosterone deficiency, and whether there is a decrease in one or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several possible clinical manifestations of testosterone deficiency, which are determined by its time of onset during reproductive development  (

         A clinician should obtain an account of the developmental milestones of sexual development, current symptoms, and information about possible causes of hypogonadism  (

          First trimester
         </strong>
         – Ambiguous genitalia in a male at birth indicates deficient testosterone production or androgen action during the first trimester. Complete lack of testosterone production or androgen action during this period results in female external genitalia (clitoris and labia). Incomplete testosterone deficiency or androgen action causes partial virilization, ranging from posterior labioscrotal fusion and micropenis when the deficiency is severe, to simply hypospadias when it is mild.

          Third trimester
         </strong>
         – Micropenis at birth suggests deficient testosterone production in the third trimester. Bilateral cryptorchidism is usually associated with diminished spermatogenesis and sometimes with low testosterone in adulthood. (See

          Adult
         </strong>
         – When testosterone deficiency first occurs after completion of puberty, symptoms may include a decrease in energy and libido that occurs within days to weeks. However, sexual hair, muscle mass, and bone mineral density usually do not diminish to a significant degree for several years, although profound deficiency may cause a more rapid decline. Adults may also present with infertility. (See

         Because testosterone affects many tissues, lack of testosterone can cause many different symptoms. In adults, the symptoms are likely to be worse if the hypogonadism develops over the course of weeks or months than slowly over years.

         Adolescents and young adults who have not yet completed puberty appear younger than their chronologic age. They may also present with small genitalia, difficulty gaining muscle mass in spite of vigorous exercise, lack of a beard, and failure of the voice to deepen. (See

         In adult men, several common but nonspecific symptoms begin within a few weeks of the onset of testosterone deficiency: decreased vigor and libido and depressed mood [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ]. Decreased muscle mass and body hair are less common but do not occur for a year or many years. Hot flashes occur only when the degree of hypogonadism is severe and especially when the rate of fall is rapid. Gynecomastia, tender or not, is more likely to occur in primary than secondary hypogonadism, as is infertility.

         There are a number of signs on physical examination that provide strong evidence of hypogonadism. The physical examination should focus first on whether or not the patient is normally virilized and has normal genitalia. If either is abnormal, the exam should then be directed toward clues as to whether the hypogonadism is primary or secondary and if it began before or after puberty.

         Males who develop hypogonadism before the onset of puberty and are not treated do not develop body hair and a beard characteristic of other men in the family, temporal hair recession, full male musculature, or deep voice. Men who develop hypogonadism after puberty may lose these characteristics if the hypogonadism is severe enough and/or of sufficient duration, usually years.

         Males who develop hypogonadism before the onset of puberty have small testes (&lt;20 mL) and a small phallus (&lt;8 cm)  (

         ). If hypogonadism develops after puberty, the testes usually decrease in size if the hypogonadism is primary, which preferentially damages the seminiferous tubules, but they usually do not decrease to a recognizable degree if it is secondary. The phallus does not decrease in size.

         Gynecomastia, the presence of glandular breast tissue in a male, is more likely to occur in primary than secondary hypogonadism. (See

         Finding eunuchoid proportions in an adult male at any age indicates that the hypogonadism developed prepubertally. Eunuchoid proportions include a lower body segment (floor to pubis) that is more than 2 cm longer than upper body segment (pubis to crown) and an arm span that is more than 5 cm longer than height. In comparison, a normal adult male has approximately equal upper and lower body segments as well as arm span and height. The absence of testosterone (and as a result, estradiol) during puberty causes a delay in epiphyseal closure so that the continued presence of growth hormone results in an increase in the length of the long bones. This relationship persists even after testosterone treatment.

        </p>
        <p>
         While the presence of physical findings provides evidence of hypogonadism, their absence in an adult is less helpful because regression of secondary sexual characteristics, such as body hair and muscle mass, may not occur for years after the onset of hypogonadism. Consequently, men with symptoms of hypogonadism should be evaluated by appropriate laboratory tests even in the absence of physical findings.

         The evaluation and diagnosis of male hypogonadism are usually straightforward. The clinician obtains clues to the possible presence of hypogonadism from the history and physical examination and confirms the diagnosis by appropriate laboratory testing  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97611" href="/z/d/graphic/97611.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial laboratory testing is based upon measuring the products of the testes (testosterone and sperm) and the pituitary hormones that control their production (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]). Testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells of the testes under stimulation of LH. Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules under stimulation principally by the high concentration of testosterone in the testes but also by FSH. Testosterone, in turn, inhibits both LH and FSH secretion, the latter via conversion to estradiol. FSH is also inhibited by inhibin, a product of the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules.

         Measurement of the serum testosterone concentration is usually the most important single test in the evaluation of male hypogonadism because a low value usually indicates hypogonadism. Three aspects of testosterone measurement should be considered: what form (total or free), when during the day, and how often should serum testosterone be measured  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97611" href="/z/d/graphic/97611.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Measurement of the serum total (free plus protein-bound) testosterone concentration is usually an accurate reflection of testosterone secretion. The normal range in adult men in most laboratories is approximately 300 to 800 ng/dL.

         Measurement of the serum free testosterone concentration is worthwhile only when it is suspected that an abnormality in testosterone binding to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) coexists with hypogonadism.
        </p>
        <p>
         The two most common situations of abnormal testosterone binding are obesity, which decreases SHBG concentrations in proportion to the degree of obesity  (

          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Obesity decreases the serum concentration of SHBG, thereby decreasing the serum total testosterone concentration, usually without lowering the free testosterone concentration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58970" href="/z/d/graphic/58970.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4
         </a>
         ]. The binding abnormality is proportional to the degree of obesity and is corrected by weight loss. However, severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;40 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) may cause hypothalamic hypogonadism as well as the binding abnormality [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Measurement of the serum free testosterone in a laboratory capable of performing the equilibrium dialysis assay accurately will distinguish between a binding abnormality and hypogonadism in an obese male. (See

          3,6

         Interpretation of serum testosterone measurements in men should take into consideration its diurnal fluctuation, which reaches a maximum at about 8 AM and a minimum (approximately 70 percent of the maximum) at about 8 PM  (

         The serum testosterone concentration fluctuates somewhat even early in the morning, although to a limited degree. If a single 8 to 10 AM value is well within the normal range, testosterone production can be assumed to be normal. If a single 8 to 10 AM value is low or borderline low or does not fit with the clinical findings, the measurement should be repeated once or twice before making the diagnosis of hypogonadism. If the results are equivocal, measurement of free testosterone can be considered [

         If the serum testosterone is below normal on two occasions, a serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration should be measured to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism  (

          algorithm 1

         ). Measuring basal serum concentrations of both LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) help to interpret subnormal values for serum testosterone and sperm count. However, a semen analysis is not part of the evaluation for all men presenting with hypogonadism, only those pursuing fertility or those with known infertility. The following patterns may be found:

         If the serum testosterone concentration is subnormal, supranormal serum LH and FSH concentrations (normal range for both approximately 1 to 8 mIU/mL in most laboratories) indicate primary hypogonadism and values that are not supranormal indicate secondary hypogonadism. Clearly elevated gonadotropin values are indicative of primary hypogonadism even if the serum testosterone concentration is in the low-normal range. Age probably causes some degree of secondary hypogonadism, so an elevated LH due to primary hypogonadism may not be as high in older men as in younger men.

         Some men with primary hypogonadism present with a subnormal sperm count, high serum FSH, but normal serum testosterone and LH concentrations. This pattern indicates seminiferous tubule damage, but normal testosterone production by the Leydig cells.

         Men who have acquired secondary hypogonadism should be evaluated for other pituitary hormonal deficiencies by measurement of the serum concentrations of cortisol at 8 AM and of thyroxine or free thyroxine. (See

         In men with secondary hypogonadism, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should always be performed if the patient has other pituitary hormonal abnormalities, a visual field abnormality, or other neurologic abnormalities. If there is no other evidence of pituitary or hypothalamic disease, finding a mass lesion on MRI is more likely the younger and healthier the patient and the lower the serum testosterone concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a man &lt;40 years old, as an example, a confirmed testosterone value of &lt;250 ng/dL would warrant an MRI, but in a man &gt;60 years old, a value of &lt;150 ng/dL would be necessary to warrant it. The rationale for the age differential is that the serum testosterone concentration decreases with increasing age, so that moderately low serum testosterone concentrations, eg, 200 to 300 ng/dL, are relatively common in men &gt;65 years old and are usually not associated with sellar mass lesions (see

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Hypogonadism in a male refers to a decrease in either or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production. These abnormalities may result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). (See
         <a class="local">

          Candidates for testing
         </strong>
         – We suggest case detection by measuring serum testosterone when hypogonadism is suspected, such as in those with sexual symptoms, osteoporosis-associated fractures, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated weight loss, those taking sustained-release opioids or high-dose glucocorticoids for prolonged periods, and those who are incompletely virilized or have small testes on examination.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Men with acute or subacute illness should not be assessed for hypogonadism, as they will have a transient functional secondary hypogonadism. (See

          Serum total testosterone
         </strong>
         – To make the diagnosis of hypogonadism, we suggest measuring a morning serum total testosterone concentration between 8 and 10 AM on at least two days.

         <strong>
          Serum free testosterone
         </strong>
         – Measurement of the serum free testosterone concentration is worthwhile only when it is suspected that an abnormality in testosterone binding to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) coexists with hypogonadism. The two most common situations of abnormal testosterone binding are obesity, which decreases SHBG concentrations, and aging, which increases SHBG. (See

         <strong>
          LH and FSH
         </strong>
         – If the total testosterone is subnormal, it should be repeated between 8 and 10 AM, and serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating (FSH) concentrations should be measured to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism. (See
         <a class="local">
