While prostate cancer remains a lethal disease (killing roughly 1 in every 36 American males), there is a broad disease spectrum, particularly with localized disease, with one-half or more of males not needing immediate intervention [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In addition, there are males with higher risk, localized disease for whom the appropriate extent of treatment remains unclear (ie, surgery only, radiation therapy [RT] only, or a combined modality approach that may include surgery, RT, and/or androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6940.html" rel="external">"Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement"</a>.)</p><p>Risk stratification has traditionally relied on clinicopathologic features, such as prostate-specific antigen, grade group  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), clinical stage  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and percentage of positive biopsy cores, to define prognostic risk groups  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). In addition, nomograms and scoring models have been developed based on these clinicopathologic parameters (eg, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment [CAPRA] score [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]) to predict the risk of prostate cancer progression. While these are powerful tools, they have limitations. Advances over the last decade have dramatically increased both our understanding of prostate cancer biology and our ability to obtain molecular information from small amounts of prostate tissue. Along with these advances have come newly available and emerging tissue-based prostate cancer biomarker tests, which promise to help determine prostate cancer prognosis and guide treatment decisions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">"Localized prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Current molecular tests that may better determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer have been developed based on either general features of malignancy (namely proliferation indices) or molecular features that are more specific for prostate cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126666" href="/d/graphic/126666.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). These tests include those based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and those based on RNA expression. While phase III trials will validate which of these genomic classifiers, if any, should be used routinely, we summarize here the available tests, the current available data for the tests in prostate cancer prognostication, and their possible clinical applications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H633450521"><span class="h1">AVAILABLE TESTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40176767"><span class="h2">Tests based on molecular characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An increased understanding of prostate cancer biology has led to the development of molecular tests that are more specifically tailored to prostate cancer. In addition, an expanded ability to utilize fresh-frozen, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue has allowed the genome-wide assessment of expression through RNA profiling to determine markers specific to prostate cancer prognosis.</p><p>Oncotype Dx Genomic Prostate Score and Decipher are multimarker tests that are specific to prostate cancer, are commercially available, and are recommended by expert groups for risk stratification in clinically localized disease and, in the case of Decipher, for selection of males for postprostatectomy radiation therapy (RT). (See <a class="local">'ASCO/AUA/EAU guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>Loss of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (<em>PTEN</em>) tumor suppressor appears to be both biologically relevant and clinically prognostic as a marker in untreated localized prostate cancer and, possibly, in males who have undergone treatment of their disease. Further immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation of <em>PTEN</em> in males diagnosed by needle biopsy is needed before adoption as a clinical test in populations considering surveillance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40176779"><span class="h3">Genomic classifier (Decipher)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Decipher (Decipher Biosciences, formally Genome Dx) is a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA)/College of American Pathologist (CAP)-certified genome-wide microarray that uses expression of 22 RNA markers (coding and noncoding) to predict metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality. The assay was developed by comparing the molecular profiles of high-risk males with prostate cancer who developed rapid metastasis after prostatectomy with those of a matched cohort of males with favorable outcomes following surgery; a 22-marker prostate cancer classifier (also called the genomic classifier) was developed [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and subsequently validated independently by several groups [<a href="#rid4">4-10</a>].</p><p>The genome-wide expression array is run on tissue, and the prostate cancer classifier score is outputted (ranging from 0 to 1) based on the expression of these 22 markers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H595683678"><span class="h4">Intended use and available data</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the data on Decipher have examined its utility as a prognostic tool after prostatectomy; it has also been studied as a tool to guide the selection of active surveillance in males with intermediate- and low-risk prostate cancer, and the use of adjuvant or salvage RT for males with adverse pathologic features following prostatectomy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognostication</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a blinded validation study, the Decipher assay had independent value on multivariable analysis for predicting metastasis following prostatectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5 for each 10 percent increase in score) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. When used as a categorical variable, prostate cancer classifier scores &gt;0.45 were associated with an increased risk of metastasis, with scores &gt;0.6 placing males at considerably higher risk for disease progression following local treatment. These results were validated in two separate prostatectomy cohorts [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In addition to predicting metastasis after prostatectomy, the prostate cancer classifier has also been shown to be associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>] and progressive disease in males undergoing adjuvant or salvage RT [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>]. A meta-analysis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] showed a statistically significant association between high (&gt;0.6) versus low (&lt;0.45) prostate cancer classifier scores and an increased risk of distant metastasis, but not with intermediate (0.45 to 0.6) versus low prostate cancer classifier scores, after adjusting for the use of adjuvant and salvage post-radical-prostatectomy treatments. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a separate study, prostate cancer classifier scores &gt;0.6 independently predicted distant metastasis when compared with other adverse clinicopathologic features available at prostatectomy (ie, Gleason score 8 to 10, seminal vesicle or lymph node invasion) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Concurrent adjustments for clinicopathologic features, timing of adjuvant and salvage postprostatectomy therapies, and timing of scans to ascertain metastatic disease in a single study would provide further strength to support the association between a prostate cancer classifier score &gt;0.6 and the risk of metastatic disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Implementation of the genomic prostate cancer classifier score for prognostic assessment after prostatectomy is most informative with inclusion of standard clinical and pathologic features [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The value of adding Decipher to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) surgical score [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] to improve the prediction of prostate cancer mortality following radical prostatectomy was shown in an analysis of 185 males at high risk of recurrence postprostatectomy who underwent treatment at a single institution between 2000 and 2006 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Among the 85 males with high CAPRA scores, 17 of the 33 males who also had high-risk Decipher scores experienced cancer-specific mortality (52 percent); Decipher reclassified the remaining 49 males as low to intermediate risk, and only three cancer-specific mortality events were observed (6 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Additional information is available from an ancillary study of the RTOG 9601 trial, a double-blind trial of males receiving salvage RT that demonstrated the superiority of two years of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9154" href="/d/drug information/9154.html" rel="external">bicalutamide</a> over placebo in conjunction with prostate bed RT (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6952.html" rel="external">"Rising or persistently elevated serum PSA following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: Management", section on 'Prostate bed RT plus androgen deprivation therapy'</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Genomic classifier (GC) scores were generated from 486 of the 760 randomized patients, and 352 that passed microarray quality control comprised the final cohort for analysis [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, Gleason score, T-stage, margin status, PSA level at trial entry, and treatment arm, the GC was independently associated with distant metastases (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.32) and prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.20-1.63). Data from this trial specifically addressing the utility of the GC for decision making about postprostatectomy management (prediction of benefit from ADT given in conjunction with RT) are discussed below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Decipher may also be of utility in predicting distant metastases in males undergoing primary RT for prostate cancer [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Using prespecified prostate cancer classifier risk categories, the cumulative incidence of metastasis for scores &gt;0.6 reached 20 percent at five years after RT, while the cumulative risk of metastases through the duration of follow-up for those with classifier scores ≤0.2 was zero.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prediction of benefit from postprostatectomy radiation therapy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In addition to prognostic genomic signatures, the genome-wide information available from Decipher testing has allowed the development of signatures that may be predictive of response to adjuvant or salvage RT (ie, the 24-gene Post-Operative Radiation Therapy Outcome Score [PORTOS]) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In the initial report, this signature was not prognostic for metastatic progression following prostatectomy in males not receiving additional RT, but males with high PORTOS scores had a roughly sevenfold <strong>decrease</strong> in metastases if adjuvant or salvage RT was employed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The impact of the score on subsequent decision making for postprostatectomy RT was shown in the prospective PRO-IMPACT study [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. After Decipher testing, 18 percent of treatment recommendations changed among males considering adjuvant RT, and 32 percent of recommendations changed in males considering salvage RT. Males with higher probabilities of metastasis were more often recommended more intense therapy. The use of Decipher was associated with decreased decisional conflict and, for males who were classified as low risk according to Decipher, less anxiety and fear of a prostate cancer recurrence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Decipher may also aid in decision making for adjuvant versus early salvage RT following prostatectomy for high-risk tumors. In a retrospective analysis of 188 males with pT3 or margin-positive prostate cancer who received postprostatectomy RT at two separate institutions over a 19-year period, the cumulative incidence of metastasis at five years after RT was 0, 9, and 29 percent for low (&lt;0.4), intermediate (0.4 to 0.6), and high (&gt;0.6) Decipher risk scores, respectively [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The low-risk Decipher score subset had excellent long-term outcomes, irrespective of the timing of postoperative RT (ie, adjuvant versus salvage). By contrast, for males with higher Decipher scores, the five-year cumulative incidence of metastasis was 6 percent for those treated with adjuvant RT and 23 percent for those who deferred RT until their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, given the results of more recently conducted randomized trials directly comparing both approaches, practice patterns are shifting away from adjuvant in favor of salvage RT for most males. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6934.html" rel="external">"Prostate cancer: Postoperative management of pathologic stage T3 disease, positive surgical margins, and lymph node involvement following radical prostatectomy", section on 'RT: adjuvant versus early salvage'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In our view, no genetic test of the resected prostate can accurately aid in the selection of postsurgical RT, regardless of timing, and until further information becomes available (including the results of a randomized trial testing the impact of Decipher results on treatment decisions and outcomes after radical prostatectomy [<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fresults%3Fcond%3D%26term%3DNCT02783950%26type%3D%26rslt%3D%26age_v%3D%26gndr%3D%26intr%3D%26titles%3D%26outc%3D%26spons%3D%26lead%3D%26id%3D%26cntry%3D%26state%3D%26city%3D%26dist%3D%26locn%3D%26rsub%3D%26strd_s%3D%26strd_e%3D%26prcd_s%3D%26prcd_e%3D%26sfpd_s%3D%26sfpd_e%3D%26rfpd_s%3D%26rfpd_e%3D%26lupd_s%3D%26lupd_e%3D%26sort%3D&amp;token=yDkIOPgKHKrUaNsNT4h1tdlYPl9hmSm%2FYqa8AlxaCu4Afhmep3y5QkiWynEGOYTPT8CZgknMOUKyPkC%2F%2FH3F9V0aukmWglQp9S9tg11e%2BObsmZncPtzaVU7qxXdo9vY8VQb0AyrP376T2%2F%2FK4UV3kDBjKevMDozVDBVIcYlqH%2FiehC19onOgKjOo25T%2Fi%2F1uPAk5k18QvYebgak39FhbELZg5Ab7CH3wSlrAzqXBUxo%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=94751" target="_blank">NCT02783950</a>]), routine use of genomic markers in the postprostatectomy setting should not be offered. Routine monitoring of serum PSA postsurgery, and treatment with salvage RT if the PSA is observed to become detectable (0.1 ng/mL) and rising is the standard of care in this setting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prediction of benefit from ADT given in conjunction with</strong> <strong>RT</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The RTOG 9601 trial was a double-blind trial of males receiving salvage RT that demonstrated the superiority of two years of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9154" href="/d/drug information/9154.html" rel="external">bicalutamide</a> over placebo in conjunction with prostate bed RT.

GC scores were generated from 486 of the 760 randomized patients, and 352 that passed microarray quality control comprised the final cohort for analysis. Although the planned original analysis was not powered to detect a significant treatment interaction by GC score, the estimated absolute effect of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9154" href="/d/drug information/9154.html" rel="external">bicalutamide</a> on 12-year overall survival was less when comparing patients with a lower versus a higher GC score (2.4 versus 8.9 percent), which was especially prominent when the analysis was limited to males receiving early salvage RT at a PSA level &lt;0.7 ng/mL in whom the use of bicalutamide for males with a lower GC values associated with a lower overall survival as compared with those with higher values (-7.8 versus +4.6 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Prospective validation is needed before generalized use of GC score for treatment decision making on the omission of ADT can be endorsed. Preferably, validation should take place in a trial in which males with a high GC score are randomly assigned to RT alone or with ADT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk stratification in males considering active surveillance</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Decipher testing was performed on diagnostic biopsies in a cohort of 266 males with very low-, low-, and favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, and the results were compared with histologic findings at subsequent radical prostatectomy [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. After adjusting for CAPRA score at diagnosis [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], Decipher was an independent predictor of adverse pathology at prostatectomy (odds ratio 1.29 [95% CI 1.03-1.61] per each 10 percent increase). The negative predictive value (which determined the degree of confidence in the absence of adverse pathology) was 91 percent (95% CI 87-94) and 96 percent (95% CI 90-99) for Decipher thresholds of 0.45 and 0.2, respectively. These patients would be predicted to be good candidates for active surveillance.</p><p></p><p>Year 2019 clinical guidelines on molecular markers in localized prostate cancer from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) concluded that Decipher may be offered in situations in which the assay result, when considered as a whole with routine clinical factors, is likely to affect management [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. This includes informing males about the suitability of active surveillance and helping to guide risk stratification, patient counseling, and management decisions when proceeding to treatment. Decipher was the only molecular biomarker to be recommended for consideration in guiding the decision between postprostatectomy adjuvant RT and salvage RT, and the Decipher PORTOS signature is the only predictive biomarker for RT response.

A common relatively early event in the clonal evolution of prostate cancer is loss of the <em>PTEN</em> tumor suppressor on chromosome 10q [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. <em>PTEN</em> normally functions to halt the PI3K/AKT (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase 3) pathway, the activation of which leads to cell growth, survival, and motility [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Members of the PI3K/AKT pathway are altered in up to 50 percent of all primary prostate cancers and in virtually 100 percent of all metastatic lesions [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Reflective of its biologic importance, <em>PTEN</em> deletion in mouse models leads to locally invasive prostate cancer and results in rapid progression to metastatic disease when combined with additional genomic alterations (such as the deletion of <em>SMAD4</em> [mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4]) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>Using routinely collected tissue, <em>PTEN</em> loss can be measured at the DNA level with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and at the expression level with IHC.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1456145395"><span class="h4">Intended use and available data</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>PTEN</em> loss has demonstrated prognostic value in males with low-risk disease conservatively managed without definitive therapy; its utility is less certain in males managed with surgery:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Transatlantic Prostate Group (TAPG) evaluated <em>PTEN</em> loss with both IHC and FISH in a group of conservatively managed males with localized prostate cancer [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].

In total, 18 percent of this cohort had <em>PTEN</em> loss by IHC. Perhaps correlating with its biology as an early molecular event, <em>PTEN</em> loss was highly predictive of prostate cancer mortality in males with low-risk characteristics (those with low Gleason score, low PSA, low Ki-67 staining, and low extent of disease; HR of prostate cancer death 7.4, p = 0.012 in these males, p = 8.13 among males with Gleason sums less than 7). By contrast, <em>PTEN</em> loss did not correlate with prognosis in higher-risk males. This indicates that IHC identifying <em>PTEN</em> loss, as opposed to cell-cycle proliferation indices, may have an important clinical role in determining which low-risk males are inappropriate candidates for deferred treatment of their localized prostate cancer.

Indeed, in one series of close to 400 patients studied using IHC, <em>PTEN</em> loss was a significant determinant of future metastasis and death after prostatectomy on univariate analysis, but it lost significance on multivariable analysis that incorporated stage, grade, and surgical margin status [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].

If there are concerns about unsampled high-grade cancers within the prostate, MRI may be preferred to guide targeted biopsy; to optimize understanding of the natural history of a biopsy-detected intermediate-grade cancer (eg, grade group 2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)), genomics might be favored.

Use may be considered, for example, in select unfavorable intermediate-risk patients when deciding whether to add androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to radiation therapy (RT). There are no comparative data that any one test is better than another. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement", section on 'Intermediate-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3964287674"><span class="h3">Decision making for postprostatectomy radiation therapy</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In guiding the decision of postprostatectomy adjuvant RT versus salvage RT in a man with adverse pathologic features (≥T3  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), grade group 3 to 5  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), node positive) and an undetectable PSA postprostatectomy, the Decipher genomic classifier may help with risk stratification and identify those who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant versus early salvage RT. Decipher was the only molecular biomarker to be recommended for consideration in guiding the decision of postprostatectomy adjuvant RT versus salvage RT, and the Decipher Post-Operative Radiation Therapy Outcomes Score [PORTOS] signature is the only predictive biomarker for RT response.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, as noted above, given the results of more recently conducted randomized trials directly comparing both approaches, practice patterns are shifting away from adjuvant in favor of salvage RT for most males, and no genetic test of the resected prostate can accurately aid in the selection of postsurgical RT (either adjuvant or salvage RT). Routine use of genomic markers in the postprostatectomy setting should not be offered. Routine monitoring of serum PSA postsurgery, and treatment with salvage RT if the PSA is observed to be detectable (0.1 ng/mL) and rising is the standard of care in this setting.

Although associated with an increased risk of clinical endpoints, including metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, future validation in prospective trials is needed to substantiate these observations, given the relatively small number of events.

Examples include select males with high-volume low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer considering active surveillance, or for treatment intensification in males with high-risk features. In the absence of prospective trial data, routine ordering of molecular biomarkers is not recommended. (See <a class="local">'ASCO/AUA/EAU guidelines'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Beyond this guideline, prospective data are now available from a post-hoc analysis of the RTOG 9601 trial, which provides some evidence to support the use of molecular biomarkers for post-operative decision making (ie, males with a low PSA and low genomic classifier [GC] score may consider the omission of ADT during postoperative RT). However, in our view, prospective validation is recommended before generalized use of GC score for treatment decision-making on the omission of ADT is warranted.

While there are patients for whom MRI and biomarker testing can provide independent and actionable information, the increase in testing intensity from using both MRI and biomarker testing would clearly increase cost, and it is not clear which specific patients would benefit from both.
