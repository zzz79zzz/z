         Fever occurs frequently in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of neutropenic fever include the direct effects of chemotherapy on mucosal barriers and immune deficits related to the underlying malignancy or other immunosuppressive conditions or therapies. Prior to the era of empiric antibiotic therapy, infections accounted for most episodes of neutropenic fever and approximately 70 percent of the mortality in neutropenic acute leukemia patients [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Because of the routine use of prompt empiric antibiotics, infections are documented less frequently today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the majority of patients with neutropenic fever do not have a documented infection, consensus guidelines recommend that all cancer patients with neutropenic fever be promptly evaluated and treated with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. This approach is indicated since it is difficult to distinguish life-threatening infections from less serious infections in this patient population, and infection may progress rapidly in such patients. Furthermore, better outcomes are seen with prompt therapy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The recommendations below are generally in keeping with the 2010 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer and the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology/IDSA guidelines for outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy [

         Fever in neutropenic patients is defined as a single oral temperature of ≥38.3°C (101°F) or a temperature of ≥38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained over a one-hour period [

         The definition of neutropenia may vary from institution to institution, but neutropenia is usually defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500 or 1000 cells/microL, severe neutropenia is as an ANC &lt;500 cells/microL or an ANC that is expected to decrease to &lt;500 cells/microL over the next 48 hours, and profound neutropenia as an ANC &lt;100 cells/microL [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4,5
         </a>
         ]. The risk of clinically important infection rises as the neutrophil count falls below 500 cells/microL and is higher in those with a prolonged duration of neutropenia (&gt;7 days). For the purposes of this discussion,
         <strong>
          we are defining severe neutropenia as an ANC &lt;500 cells/microL.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The ANC can be calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell (WBC) count by the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and bands (

         Bacteremia is documented in only 10 to 25 percent of neutropenic fever episodes, and clinically documented infections are found in 20 to 30 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Most documented infections during neutropenia are due to bacteria. Although gram-negative organisms predominated a few decades ago, most documented infections are now due to gram-positive organisms. Factors contributing to this trend include use of long-term central venous catheters and empiric and prophylactic antimicrobials that are primarily active against gram-negative pathogens. Fungi and viruses can also be pathogens, particularly in high-risk patients. (See

         </span>
         In all cancer patients presenting with neutropenic fever, empiric antibacterial therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures have been obtained and before any other investigations have been completed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initiation of empiric therapy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         All patients should undergo a careful history and detailed physical examination as well as laboratory, microbiology, and imaging studies; the approach to the diagnostic evaluation is summarized in the following table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50509" href="/z/d/graphic/50509.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Because symptoms and signs of infection are attenuated due to the lack of an inflammatory reaction, fever may be the sole sign of infection. Thus, it is important to recognize that the absence of the typical symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings suggestive of infection typically seen in non-neutropenic patients cannot be used to exclude the possibility of infection. The evaluation should be performed promptly.

         The history should probe for the development of new symptoms that can lead to identification of a site of infection. The initial clinical evaluation also focuses on assessing the risk of serious complications. (See

         The initial clinical evaluation focuses on assessing the risk of serious complications in addition to the presence of a documented infection. The risk assessment dictates the approach to therapy, including the need for inpatient admission, intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and prolonged hospitalization.

         A thorough general physical examination should be performed. The emphasis should be on sites most likely to be infected, including the skin, catheter sites, biopsy and bone marrow aspirate sites, teeth, oropharynx and gingival surfaces, sinuses, lungs, abdomen, genitals, and perianal area. As noted above, it is important to remember that in the absence of neutrophils, signs of inflammation can be extremely subtle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Review of systems and a physical examination should be repeated daily. In patients with persistent fever, new sites of infection (eg, lungs, skin, and urinary tract) may become apparent over time. In addition, as the neutrophil count recovers, localizing symptoms and signs of infection often become evident for the first time.

         All IV catheter sites, especially central venous catheter (CVC) sites, should be carefully examined for subtle signs of infection; slight erythema or tenderness may be the only evidence of a serious "tunnel" infection. Fluctuance or exudates are unlikely since the lack of inflammatory cells inhibits the development of inflammatory reactions. IV catheters should also be assessed for any malfunction; difficulty with infusion or blood drawing can also be a sign of an infected venous thrombosis, even in the absence of a problem with the exit site. Sites of recent IV catheters should also be examined.

         In all cancer patients presenting with neutropenic fever, empiric antibacterial therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures have been obtained and before any other investigations have been completed. The microbiologic evaluation should be performed promptly. (See
         <a class="local">

         Specimens for the microbiology laboratory should include at least two sets of blood cultures  (

         </a>
         ]. Each set should have a volume of 20 mL (proportionally smaller volume in children weighing &lt;40 kg; eg, no more than 1 percent of estimated patient total blood volume). In patients with a CVC, we prefer to collect a set of blood cultures simultaneously from each lumen and from a peripheral vein site. Some experts feel that it is acceptable to collect both sets of cultures from the CVC, especially in patients with difficult peripheral venous access. In patients without a CVC, a set should be obtained from each of two separate venipuncture sites. The diagnosis of CVC infections is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         Two sets of blood cultures are typically repeated daily for persistent fevers or rigors at least during the first two days following initiation of empiric antibiotics [

          2
         </a>
         ]. Institutions may have different guidelines for the frequency of obtaining blood cultures. As an example, some centers stop collecting blood cultures or reduce the frequency of collection after several days if the initial cultures are negative for patients with a stable fever pattern. If the cultures are positive, they should be repeated until they become negative to ensure response to therapy and intermittently thereafter.

         Specimens should be obtained from other sites as clinically indicated (eg, sputum, urine, CVC exit site, CSF, skin, stool). Many neutropenic patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy are also thrombocytopenic; in such patients, platelet transfusions are often necessary in order to safely perform a lumbar puncture or other invasive procedures.

         In febrile neutropenic patients with respiratory signs or symptoms, we suggest that a chest radiograph be obtained in low-risk patients and a noncontrast intermediate- or high-resolution chest CT be obtained in high-risk patients (see
         <a class="local">
          'Risk assessment'
         </a>
         above). In contrast, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend a chest radiograph as part of the initial evaluation for neutropenic fever in patients with respiratory symptoms without distinction by risk status [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. It is important to note, however, that chest radiograph findings are often minimal or absent, even in patients with pneumonia or pulmonary nodules. Intermediate- or high-resolution chest CT is much more sensitive for detecting abnormalities in neutropenic patients. One should be mindful that detection of small nodules may represent benign granulomas in certain areas endemic for certain infections rather than active infection, and therefore caution in interpretation should be exercised.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, high-resolution chest CT demonstrated pneumonia in more than one-half of persistently febrile neutropenic patients who had normal findings on routine chest radiograph [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. It was estimated that high-resolution CT scanning resulted in the diagnosis being established five days earlier compared with the exclusive use of chest radiographs but did not improve clinical outcomes. Although CT scanning has not been shown to change clinical outcomes, one should have a low threshold for ordering a CT scan in both high- and low-risk neutropenic patients with pulmonary symptoms to help guide the selection and duration of treatment and to assess for radiographic evidence of invasive fungal disease. Repeat chest imaging should be obtained for increasing or persistent pulmonary symptoms and signs, including cough, shortness of breath, and/or hypoxia [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Radiographic findings may become evident along with an increase in symptoms as the neutropenia begins to resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
         CT scanning of other sites (head, sinuses, abdomen/pelvis) should be performed according to suggestive symptoms or other risk factors [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Fever in a neutropenic patient should be considered a medical emergency  (

         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, the evaluation of such patients should occur promptly, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given as soon as possible (within 60 minutes of presentation) and at full doses (adjusted for renal and/or hepatic function). In all cancer patients presenting with neutropenic fever, empiric antibacterial therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures have been obtained and before any other investigations have been completed.

         The aim of empiric therapy is to cover the most likely and most virulent pathogens that may rapidly cause serious or life-threatening infection in neutropenic patients [

         Persistent or recurrent fever should prompt a thorough search for a source of occult infection. Repeat cultures of blood and other cultures or diagnostic tests should be performed on the basis of symptoms and signs. Diarrhea should be evaluated with a

         Repeating and/or broadening the imaging evaluation is warranted for persistent or recurrent fever. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan should be considered to evaluate for neutropenic enterocolitis when abdominal signs are present (see

          Fever is a medical emergency
         </strong>
         − Fever during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a medical emergency requiring prompt evaluation and treatment. Fever in neutropenic patients is defined as a single oral temperature of &gt;38.3°C (101.0°F) or a temperature of &gt;38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained for &gt;1 hour. We define severe neutropenia as an absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/microL. (See

          Microbiology

         − Bacteremia is documented in only 10 to 25 percent of neutropenic fever episodes, and clinically documented infections are found in 20 to 30 percent. Most documented infections during neutropenia are due to gram-positive organisms. Fungi and viruses can also be pathogens, particularly in high-risk patients. (See
