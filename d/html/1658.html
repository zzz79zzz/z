         Pulmonary artery catheters (PACs; also called Swan-Ganz catheters) are inserted in the intensive care unit and in the operating room for the evaluation and management of critically ill patients. They are also placed in clinically stable patients (eg, in a coronary catheterization unit), most often for the diagnosis and management of some patients with suspected or known pulmonary hypertension or for unexplained dyspnea.
        </p>
        <p>
         The insertion of PACs is reviewed here. The indications, contraindications, complications, and interpretation of PAC measurements are discussed separately. (See

         The major hemodynamic indices measured on pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) are pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery occlusion (ie, wedge) pressure, right atrial and right ventricular pressure, cardiac output and cardiac index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SvO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ). (See

          "Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults", section on 'Physiologic measurements'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the routine use of PACs in critically ill patients has fallen out of favor, hemodynamic measurements obtained by PAC can be helpful in those with unexplained shock or those with unknown volume status despite active fluid resuscitation, as well as in patients with severe cardiogenic shock (eg, acute valvular disease) or those with suspected or known pulmonary artery hypertension  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68139" href="/z/d/graphic/68139.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). PACs can also be used to guide fluid resuscitation, titrate vasopressors, assess the hemodynamic effects of changes in mechanical ventilator settings, or assess response to medications (eg, pulmonary hypertension-specific medication). PACs are occasionally inserted preoperatively for high risk cardiopulmonary surgery and in rare cases are inserted for the investigation of unexplained dyspnea. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1436.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the patient with dyspnea", section on 'Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with pulmonary artery catheterization'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Absolute contraindications include infection at the insertion site, right ventricular assist device, and insertion during cardiopulmonary bypass, as well as lack of consent. Relative contraindications to the placement of a PAC include those with a coagulopathy (international normalized ratio &gt;1.5), thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50,000/microL), electrolyte disturbances (hypo- or hyper-kalemia, -magnesemia, -natremia, -calcemia), and severe acid-base disturbances (eg, pH &lt;7.2 or &gt;7.5).

         Once a decision is made to insert a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), a site should be selected, the appropriate personnel recruited, and all necessary equipment should be placed in the patient’s room. When feasible, we prefer that the PAC be placed in the right jugular vein under ultrasound guidance. Consent should be in place and laboratory studies should ensure that no severe coagulopathy, electrolyte, or acid-base disturbances exist to increase the risk of hemorrhage or arrhythmias.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The site of insertion should be selected in advance so that the appropriate equipment can be in place (eg, fluoroscopy and a longer catheter is required for femoral or antecubital vein approaches).
        </p>
        <p>
         Options include insertion into the internal jugular, subclavian, femoral, or antecubital (basilic or brachial) vein [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. We prefer to use the right internal jugular vein or as an alternative, the left subclavian vein; these approaches facilitate passage of the catheter into the pulmonary artery. The femoral and antecubital veins are generally avoided but can be used when no other access is available (eg, hematoma or altered neck and chest anatomy from prior radiation).
        </p>
        <p>
         For cardiac surgery, the right followed by left internal jugular vein is often the first-choice approaches because after sternotomy and sternal retraction, a PAC inserted by the subclavian route may be compressed and kinked under the clavicle, making it impossible to withdraw or advance the catheter, should this be required during the course of surgery. The advantages and disadvantages of each location are described in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56392" href="/z/d/graphic/56392.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15672.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         When feasible, we advise that the target vessel be visualized by using a hand-held ultrasound device to determine the optimal insertion site by allowing the clinician to see the size, configuration, and position of the blood vessels. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6315.html" rel="external">
          "Basic principles of ultrasound-guided venous access"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In some patients, a central venous catheter (CVC) that is already in place can be exchanged for PAC provided sufficient access is in place elsewhere during PAC insertion for the infusion of critical life-sustaining and life-saving medications. In such circumstances, ensuring that a sterile wire of sufficient length is used to exchange the CVC for the PAC introducer is important.
        </p>
        <p>
         Should a pacemaker be in place (usually in the left subclavian vein), a site on the opposing side is preferred to minimize pacemaker dislodgement and infection during insertion.

         Once the decision has been made to insert a PAC, an adequate number of personnel need to be recruited. This includes a clinician experienced in the insertion of PACs to insert the catheter and nursing personnel to monitor and care for the patient. A fluoroscopist may be required for PACs that require fluoroscopy for insertion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional clinicians may be necessary in the intensive care unit to care for unattended patients as PAC insertion can be time-consuming. As an example in a study of 120 insertions, the median duration from the decision to insert a PAC to the initiation of catheter-based treatment was approximately two hours [
         <a href="#rid3">

         Resuscitation equipment. Arrhythmias and vascular complications can occur during insertion, which may require emergent resuscitation. As an example an external pacing device may be necessary should complete heart block develop, or paddles (or hands-free electrode patches) may be needed should persistent ventricular tachycardia develop.

         Fluoroscopic equipment, if fluoroscopic-guided insertion is planned. Fluoroscopy may be performed in patients who have marked right atrial enlargement, right ventricular dilatation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, or a left bundle branch block. It is also generally needed for patients who have PACs placed in the femoral vein or for those with unusual anatomy (eg, persistent left superior vena cava). Portable fluoroscopic equipment may not be available at some institutions, in which case insertion in either a cardiac catheterization laboratory or radiology department may be an alternative. (See

         For internal jugular and subclavian venous access, a wide skin preparation that includes the neck and chest above the nipple line should be performed. If difficult access is anticipated, the neck and chest can be prepared bilaterally so that an alternative site can be chosen, should the initial plan fail. For femoral venous access, a wide skin preparation encompasses the anterior and medial surfaces of the proximal thigh and extends superior to the inguinal ligament.

         For all selected sites, a wide procedural field should be prepared with strict adherence to aseptic technique. This includes hand washing with antiseptic-containing soap or alcohol-based gels or foams, full barrier precautions (sterile gloves, long-sleeved surgical gown, a surgical mask, a surgical cap, a large sterile sheet drape), skin disinfection with 2 percent

         An introducer is a wide bore (8.5 F), short, central venous catheter through which the PAC is placed (eg, cordis)  (

         ). The proximal end contains a hemostatic valve (external to the skin), through which the PAC is eventually introduced to the target vein. It also has a side-arm extension that allows continuous central venous access for fluid and drug administration. Insertion of the introducer is similar to that of central venous catheters. It is generally accomplished using the modified Seldinger technique  (

         Arterial puncture during introducer needle insertion is not unusual. The risk is reduced, but not eliminated, using ultrasound. Arterial puncture with the introducer needle is typically managed by withdrawing the needle and placing pressure on the artery for 10 to 15 minutes. However, arterial dilation and cannula placement (ie, arterial cannulation) with the introducer catheter itself is considered a more life-threatening complication, in which case, the catheter should be left in place and
         <strong>
          not

         the PAC is placed.

For jugular and subclavian approaches, a chest radiograph to confirm that no pneumothorax has occurred during insertion is advisable.

         Once the introducer has been inserted into the target blood vessel, the field should be resterilized. The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) ports should be flushed; the integrity of the balloon and the ability of the PAC to transduce pressure should also be checked. With the patient in the supine position, the PAC is advanced through the introducer, and then through the superior vena cava (SVC), cardiac chambers, and pulmonary artery (PA) while the pressure at its tip is transduced  (

         ). As a general rule, during advancement the balloon may only be inflated once the pressure tracing indicates that the tip of the catheter is in the SVC or right atrium (RA). Additionally, the balloon should only be inflated whenever the catheter is advanced, and deflated whenever the catheter is withdrawn. Distinct changes in the pressure waveforms indicate transition through each cardiac chamber as well as a final pulmonary artery wedge position.

         A simple maneuver is performed by some experts to check for proper assembly and function of the PAC and monitoring system. When the tip of the PAC is held near heart level, the recorded pressure should be 0 mmHg, confirming that the transducer was correctly adjusted to the level of the heart at the beginning of the procedure. The catheter tip is then raised up straight to create a 30 cm tall vertical column, which should produce a recorded pressure of 22 mmHg (equivalent to 30 cm H

         – The catheter has graduations with distance in centimeters from the tip clearly indicated on it. We find it useful to verbally state the distance at the bedside during advancement. While advancing the catheter, it is useful to keep in mind the "rule of 10s," where anatomic and hemodynamic changes occur at approximately 10 cm intervals. As an example, when the insertion site is an internal jugular or subclavian vein, the RA is generally entered after inserting the catheter 20 cm, the RV after inserting 30 cm, the PA after inserting 40 cm, and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) after inserting 50 cm. Estimated distances from the various insertion sites to the RA, RV, and PA are shown in the table  (

         ). The balloon should be fully inflated to a maximum volume per the manufacturers recommendation (typically 1 to 1.5 mL) during advancement. Inflation is normally met with a small amount of resistance. Excessive resistance usually indicates malposition of the catheter tip, which should prompt immediate deflation, withdrawing, and repositioning before another attempt is made to inflate the balloon. Little resistance suggests rupture of the balloon, in which case the balloon should be deflated, the catheter removed and the integrity of the balloon rechecked.

        <p>
         If a RV waveform is not observed after inserting the catheter 40 cm (ie, from an internal jugular or subclavian vein approach), coiling in the RA is likely. In this situation, the balloon should be deflated, the catheter withdrawn to 20 cm, following which advancement should be repeated with the balloon inflated.

         Rarely, does the PAC enter the left atrium (LA) through a coronary sinus–left atrial communication. LA waveforms can be recognized by their higher amplitude when compared with RA waveforms as well as by their similar appearance to pulmonary capillary wedge waveforms  (

         The risk of arrhythmia is greatest while the catheter tip is in the RV. Thus, the catheter should be advanced from the RV to the PA without delay. When the catheter tip passes across the pulmonic valve (from the RV to the PA), the diastolic pressure increases and a characteristic dicrotic notch appears in the waveform  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601" href="/z/d/graphic/75601.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 15 to 25 mmHg and the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure is 4 to 15 mmHg.
        </p>
        <p>
         If more than 30 cm to 40 cm of the catheter has been inserted (assuming that the insertion site is an internal jugular or subclavian vein) and the pressure tracing still indicates that the tip is within the RV, then the catheter is probably coiling in the RV, or the RV is enlarged. In this situation, the balloon should be deflated and then the catheter should be withdrawn until the RA waveform appears usually at 20 cm. Then, the balloon can be reinflated and another attempt can be made to advance the catheter through the RV and into the PA.
        </p>
        <p>
         If persistent coiling is suspected or difficulties in transitioning into the PA occurs (eg, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation), then the balloon should be deflated and the catheter should be withdrawn until the RA waveform reappears; the patient can be repositioned in the left lateral position with the head tilted slightly upward to encourage floatation into the PA. On occasion, a catheter may be floated to the proper position by injecting 10 to 20 mL of the iced solution prepared for cardiac output measurement or cold
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         through the distal lumen "stiffens" the tip. In a patient with low cardiac output, deep inspiration during spontaneous ventilation will increase venous return and right ventricular output transiently which may also facilitate catheter flotation into the PA. Some clinicians fill the balloon with 1.5 mL of sterile saline. However, this maneuver is risky because saline, unlike air, is noncompressible, a feature that may increase the risk of pulmonary artery rupture.
        </p>
        <p>
         Owing to gravitational and anatomic factors, most catheters float to the right PA. Thus, to catheterize the left PA selectively, the patient should be positioned with the right side down.

         </span>
         Once the catheter tip has reached the PA, it should be advanced until the pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PCOP) is identified by a decrease in the pressure combined with a change in the waveform  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601" href="/z/d/graphic/75601.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

         ). The balloon should then be deflated and the PA tracing should reappear.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the PCOP tracing persists or there is any uncertainty about whether the tracing is a PCOP or PA tracing, then the catheter should be withdrawn (with the balloon deflated) until a definitive PA tracing is identified. Occasionally, the uncertainty persists despite withdrawing the catheter. In this situation, simultaneous pressure and electrocardiographic tracings may be helpful. The peak systolic pressure in the PA occurs just prior to the electrocardiographic T wave, whereas the peak V wave of a PCOP tracing occurs after the electrocardiographic T wave. The normal mean PCOP (which is reflective of left atrial pressure) is between 4 and 12 mmHg. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Once the operator has confirmed that the catheter tip is in the PA and a PCOP can be obtained, an accurate final wedge position should be confirmed and recorded (see below).

         The final position of the catheter within the PA must be such that a PCOP tracing is obtained whenever 75 to 100 percent of the 1.5 mL maximum volume of the balloon is insufflated  (

         If less than 1 mL is required to obtain a PCOP tracing, the tip of the catheter is probably in the distal PA (ie, "over wedged") and further inflation may lead to vessel rupture. In this situation, the catheter should be withdrawn 0.1 to 0.5 cm with the balloon deflated, and then the balloon is reinflated with 1 to 1.5 mL of air to check the position. If it remains over wedged, then this process should be repeated until the optimal position is found.

         </span>
         If maximal balloon inflation fails to result in a PCOP tracing, or does so only after a 2 to 3 second delay, the catheter is probably too proximal. This means that it could slip back into the RV, increasing the risk of arrhythmia and intracardiac damage. In this situation, the catheter should be advanced with balloon inflated in small increments (0.1 to 0.5 cm) until the optimal position is located. The length of the catheter that was passed (indicated by marks on the catheter at 10 cm intervals) should be documented in the patient's medical record.

         Once the desired position is reached, if a protective sleeve is to be used it should be attached to the hub of the introducer, and a secure antiseptic dressing should be applied. If a protective sleeve is not in place, the catheter can be taped to the skin with a sterile dressing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The PCOP is best measured with the patient in the supine position, at the end of expiration. In a spontaneously breathing patient, the PAC waveform has a positive deflection during expiration, while in a ventilated patient, the PAC waveform has a negative deflection during expiration. However, at end-expiration, all intrathoracic pressures are equal to atmospheric pressure which allows the PCOP to be accurately measured regardless of whether the patient is spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated. Accurate measurement of the PCOP and sources of error including the effects of respiration are discussed separately. (See

         After the PAC has been secured, a chest radiograph should be obtained to confirm the position of the catheter. The catheter tip should ideally be located in zone 3  (

         It is preferred that pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) be left in place for as little time as possible. The PAC can be removed as a separate procedure to introducer removal. For subclavian or jugular catheter removal, the patient should be placed in slight Trendelenburg position. With the balloon deflated, the catheter should be removed during exhalation in a spontaneously breathing patient or during inspiration in a patient undergoing positive pressure ventilation to prevent air embolism. The catheter should

        </p>
        <p>
         Following catheter removal, the introducer can be used as a central venous catheter (CVC) for the administration of fluids and medications, if necessary. Alternatively, it can be replaced with a fresh CVC or removed completely. For introducer removal, the patient should be placed in Trendelenburg. The sutures should be removed, light pressure applied to the site with gauze and the catheter removed during exhalation in a spontaneously breathing patient or during inspiration in a patient undergoing positive pressure ventilation. After removal, pressure is applied at the site for one to two minutes to ensure hemostasis, and a sterile dressing should be placed over the puncture site.

         The routine use of pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) in critically ill patients has fallen out of favor. However, hemodynamic measurements obtained by PACs can be helpful in selected patients such as those with unexplained shock or those with unknown volume status despite adequate fluid resuscitation, as well as in patients with severe cardiogenic shock (eg, acute valvular disease) or in those with suspected or known pulmonary artery hypertension  (

         Once a decision is made to insert a PAC, a site should be selected, the appropriate personnel recruited, and all necessary equipment should be placed in the patient’s room. We prefer that the PAC be placed in the right jugular vein or as an alternative, the left subclavian vein under ultrasound guidance. Consent should be in place and laboratory studies should ensure that no severe bleeding disorder, electrolyte, or acid-base disturbances exist to increase the risk of hemorrhage or arrhythmias. (See

         Once the introducer has been inserted into the target blood vessel, the field should be resterilized. The PAC ports should be flushed, and the integrity of the balloon and the ability of the PAC to transduce pressure should also be checked. With the patient in the supine position, the PAC is advanced through the introducer into the superior vena cava (SVC), cardiac chambers, and pulmonary artery (PA) while the pressure at its tip is transduced.

         As a general rule during advancement, the balloon may only be inflated once the pressure tracing indicates that the tip of the catheter is in the SVC or right atrium (RA)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601" href="/z/d/graphic/75601.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Additionally, the balloon should only be inflated whenever the catheter is advanced and deflated whenever the catheter is withdrawn. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General rules'
         </a>

         </span>
         Once the catheter tip is in the SVC or RA and the balloon is inflated, the PAC is advanced slowly into the right ventricle (RV) where the pressure waveform changes and the systolic pressure increases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75601" href="/z/d/graphic/75601.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Due to the increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, the catheter tip should be advanced through the RV and into the PA without delay. Entry in to the PA is easily recognized because the diastolic pressure increases and a dicrotic notch appears. Once the catheter tip reaches the PA, it should be advanced until the pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PCOP) is identified by a decrease in the pressure combined with a change in the waveform. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Advancement through cardiac chambers'
         </a>
         above.)

         </span>
         The final position of the catheter must be such that a PCOP tracing is obtained whenever 75 to 100 percent of the 1.5 mL maximum volume of the balloon is insufflated. Once the desired position is reached, it is essential that the catheter be secured to prevent migration. A chest radiograph should then be obtained to confirm the position of the catheter. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Final wedge position'
         </a>
         above.)

         A sterile technique should be used when injecting drugs, connecting tubing, or repositioning the catheter if it migrates. Dressings should be changed routinely and the site should be checked daily for the signs of erythema or purulent exudate that might indicate infection. Complications associated with insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter include trauma to the vessels and heart, valvular damage, and arrhythmias. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1593.html" rel="external">

         It is preferred that PACs be left in place for as little time as possible. The PAC should be removed separately with the patient in slight Trendelenburg and the balloon deflated. Resistance during catheter withdrawal should prompt consultation with a subspecialist (eg, invasive cardiologist, cardiac surgeon). The introducer can be removed as a separate procedure, also with the patient in Trendelenburg, following which, pressure should be applied for one to two minutes and a sterile dressing applied. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Removal'
