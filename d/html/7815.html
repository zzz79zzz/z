Based upon these observations, aggressive resection of isolated pulmonary metastases has become a widely accepted treatment for appropriately selected patients. However, acceptance is not universal, and it needs to be proven whether surgical metastasectomy substantially improves survival [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>The benefits of metastasectomy, selection criteria, preoperative evaluation, and techniques for surgical resection, as endorsed by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], are reviewed. Outcomes according to histology are discussed elsewhere, as are issues specific to resection of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2796.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7738.html" rel="external">"Surgical treatment and other localized therapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma"</a>.) </p><p>The integration of surgery into multidisciplinary therapy for patients with specific malignancies is discussed in the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">BENEFITS OF RESECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While pulmonary metastasectomy is a commonly performed operation, belief in its effectiveness is based upon registry data and surgical follow-up studies. Until well-conducted, larger trials are completed, uncertainty will remain about the effectiveness of metastasectomy compared with other forms of treatment (eg, chemotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy) [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]. </p><p>There is only one published randomized trial examining the benefits of pulmonary metastasectomy. This trial, from Great Britain (PulMicc, NCT01106261) randomly assigned 65 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to pulmonary metastasectomy or active monitoring [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The study was stopped early for low recruitment. Since the original publication, further data from 28 randomized patients have been added. Survival data based on 18 months of additional follow-up are available. Five-year survival was similar for those randomized to surgery compared with no surgery (36.4 versus 29.6 percent), and median survival was also similar (3.78 versus 3.53, respectively) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, this trial remains underpowered to conclude that no surgery and surgery are comparable but does document the long-term survival of a substantial cohort of nonsurgically treated patients. The only endpoint measured was survival with little data on need for additional therapies and local control. Another major flaw in this study was that molecular prognostic features (eg, <em>BRAF</em> and <em>RAS</em> mutations), and the contribution of systemic chemotherapy was not delineated. PulMicc has provided some additional evidence that a modest survival benefit may be associated with metastasectomy, but probably not as prominent as previous data suggests, perhaps due to roughly 30 percent five-year survival in the nonsurgical arm (a similar value to that reported in a large retrospective series of 1033 adults undergoing stereotactic radiotherapy for extracranial oligometastatic disease, 44 percent involving lung [35 percent five-year overall survival] [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]). The lack of power in this study made it disappointing and highlights the need for well-performed larger trials with surgical randomization.</p><p>There are a growing number of studies analyzing survival and long-term relapse-free survival (ie, cure) for patients who undergo pulmonary metastasectomy. Survival analysis has greatly varied among studies, and survival is likely impacted by patient selection. The results from any one study should be interpreted critically until larger randomized controlled trials are conducted. The following retrospective reviews illustrate the benefits of a complete pulmonary metastasectomy: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review from the International Registry of Lung Metastases identified 5206 patients with a variety of primary metastatic tumors (carcinomas, sarcomas, germ cell tumors, and melanomas) who underwent a pulmonary metastasectomy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This series included 4572 (88 percent) in whom complete resection was carried out [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The overall 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 36, 26, and 22 percent, respectively. Factors associated with a better prognosis included germ cell etiology, disease-free interval of 36 months, and a single metastatic lesion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>These outcomes were further corroborated by a 2017 analysis of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center database [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Over a 25-year period, 539 patients underwent 760 metastasectomies of soft tissue sarcoma with curative intent. Although the median disease-free survival of 6.8 months was short, there was a long tail to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, 34 percent surviving five years, and 23 percent surviving seven years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2796.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology", section on 'Soft tissue sarcoma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective review of 178 consecutive patients undergoing 256 surgical resections for pulmonary metastasis identified a complete resection in 248 cases [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The five-year survival based upon primary disease site and complete resection was the highest for patients with renal cell carcinomas (51.4 percent), followed by colon or rectal cancer carcinoma (50.3 percent), sarcoma (21.7 percent), and melanoma (25 percent). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another study of pulmonary metastasectomy is ongoing in Belgium and the Netherlands [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, this prospective nonrandomized phase II multicenter trial is testing the benefit of adding isolated lung perfusion with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9605" href="/z/d/drug information/9605.html" rel="external">melphalan</a> at the time of surgical metastasectomy and is not comparing surgical metastasectomy versus systemic chemotherapy, active monitoring, or local ablation. To date, 107 patients have been treated, with no operative mortality and 42 percent grade 3 morbidity. The initial three-year overall survival rate was favorable at 57 percent and the median survival time was 44 months. An update at five years reported 0 percent mortality with a median time for colorectal carcinoma to local progression, median time to progression, and median survival of 31, 14, and 78 months, respectively. In sarcoma patients, local progression was not reached, but median time to progression and median survival were 13 and 39 months, respectively. Five-year disease-free rate and pulmonary progression-free rate were 26 and 44 percent for colorectal carcinoma and 29 and 63 percent for sarcoma [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Despite the lack of randomization to resection versus systemic chemotherapy or other local forms of treatment, this study adds additional evidence that surgical resection with or without adjuvant therapy provides an opportunity for long-term recurrence-free survival. Interestingly, the Consensus Statement from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons specifically stated: "Outside of clinical research, isolated lung perfusion is not warranted for management of pulmonary metastases" [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review from a single institution from 2008 to 2018 identified 281 patients with metastases from a wide range of tumors who had undergone pulmonary metastasectomy for curative intent [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Complete resection was achieved in 97.5 percent, and five-year overall survival rate after the first metastasectomy was 47 percent. Primary tumor origin, age, and completeness of the resection were significant independent prognostic factors. Tumor of genitourinary origin and age &lt;66 years were associated with an improved prognosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a review of 476 patients treated who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for oligometastatic disease from various primary tumors from 2000 to 2017, overall survival was 88.9 percent at one year and 49.6 percent at five years [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Factors associated with improved survival included R0 resection; colorectal primary cancers; and sublobar, nonanatomic resections.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to proceed with pulmonary metastasectomy requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes the medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and thoracic surgeon [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The goal is to offer surgery to only those patients who are most likely to benefit, either in terms of prolonging survival or symptom palliation, and to optimize the timing of surgical intervention. Where possible, all cases should be reviewed at a multidisciplinary tumor board prior to scheduling surgical metastasectomy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Criteria for considering a resection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most clinicians would accept the criteria listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140030" href="/z/d/graphic/140030.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) as meeting suitability of pulmonary metastasectomy [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. </p><p>There are few published guidelines from expert groups that deal with patient selection for pulmonary metastasectomy. Available guidelines include the consensus-based guidelines for resectability of colorectal cancer lung metastases from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] and a consensus document on pulmonary metastasectomy from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p>For patients who do not meet the criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140030" href="/z/d/graphic/140030.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), stereotactic radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation offer an alternative to resection for local control. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4624.html" rel="external">"Image-guided ablation of lung tumors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89528.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment", section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1636909782"><span class="h3">Contraindications</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of brain metastases is a contraindication to pulmonary resection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>N2 nodal involvement is generally a contraindication for pulmonary metastasectomy for tumors other than renal cell cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inability to completely resect all areas of pulmonary involvement is widely considered to represent a contraindication to pulmonary metastasectomy. Nearly all reports indicate that complete resection of metastatic disease is associated with more favorable outcomes. In the International Registry series, for example, the median survival with complete versus incomplete resection was 35 versus 15 months, and the five-year survival rate was 36 versus 13 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prior pneumonectomy is a relative contraindication to contralateral resection of pulmonary metastases. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Factors that may influence the decision</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple factors influence survival following metastasectomy, although the presence of one or more of these poor prognostic factors does not necessarily constitute an absolute contraindication to metastasectomy [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Unfavorable prognostic factors include an inability to completely resect all metastatic disease, a short disease-free interval following treatment of the primary tumor, a large number of pulmonary metastases (the STS consensus group considers pulmonary metastasectomy to be best suited to patients harboring three or fewer metastases [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]) and involved lymph nodes. Tumor histology also influences outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Lymph node spread'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2796.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Disease-free interval</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outcomes are more favorable when there has been a longer disease-free interval between primary tumor treatment and presentation of metastatic disease; however, there is no absolute time frame (including synchronous presentation of metastatic disease) that is short enough that metastasectomy would not be considered. However, particularly for a presentation of synchronous metastases, we recommend repeat chest computed tomography (CT) six to eight weeks after recognition of pulmonary metastases to assure that additional target lesions (or too many target lesions) have not appeared. (See <a class="local">'Timing of surgery'</a> below.) </p><p>Although early series yielded conflicting results about the importance of disease-free interval on outcomes [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], data from the International Registry indicate higher five-year survival rates for patients with a disease-free interval of greater than 36 months (45 versus 33 percent for a disease-free interval of less than one year) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Number of lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outcomes are better with fewer metastases. However, for patients with multiple metastases, there is no consensus among thoracic surgeons as to what disease burden represents an insurmountable obstacle. The important issue is the feasibility of resecting all sites of disease, not the absolute number of metastases per se. However, the STS consensus group considers pulmonary metastasectomy to be best suited to patients harboring three or fewer metastases [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Data from the International Registry indicate better five-year survival for patients with a single metastatic focus (single focus 43 percent versus 34 and 27 percent for those with two to three, or greater than three metastases, respectively) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This observation holds true both for patients with sarcomas and epithelial tumors [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p>The inverse relationship between the number of metastases and survival is likely due to multiple factors. The higher the number of pulmonary metastases, the greater the probability of incomplete resection  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70943" href="/z/d/graphic/70943.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], the likely heavier burden of occult disease diffusely in the lung, and the greater the probability of disease recurrence in the lung [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Additionally, if several nodules need to be removed from the same lobe or a more centrally located nodule needs to be removed, a lobectomy may be required rather than wedge resection. As more lung tissue is removed, perioperative risk increases.</p><p>A more important issue than the number of metastases is the feasibility of resecting all sites of disease, although the two are related. In a series of 92 patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy for renal cell cancer, the chance of a complete resection was over 80 percent for patients with three or fewer nodules identified on preoperative CT [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In contrast, if there were more than six nodules on the CT, the chance of a complete resection was no more than 20 percent.</p><p>If resection is not feasible at the time of exploration (eg, for technical considerations such as an incomplete pulmonary fissure or proximity to a major vascular structure that was inapparent on the preoperative radiographs), intraoperative ablation using either cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) could be considered. Another alternative is the placement of fiducials for postoperative irradiation. Where available, techniques such as frameless stereotactic radiosurgery provide an opportunity to treat focal areas of the lung to high radiation doses, while preserving adjacent normal tissue [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Lymph node spread</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary metastases may be accompanied by hilar and/or mediastinal lymph node involvement  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945" href="/z/d/graphic/73945.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Lymph node involvement is an important negative prognostic factor in patients undergoing metastasectomy, regardless of histology [<a href="#rid22">22,26-32</a>]. Sarcomas and most cancers that spread to the lungs do so through the vascular system, and the metastases appear limited to the parenchyma. However, other malignancies, notably renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, have demonstrated the ability to metastasize to the lung, and then to metastasize to the ipsilateral intrapulmonary or hilar (N1) nodes. This is believed (although not proven) to represent spread through the lymphatic system, in a manner similar to primary lung cancer, and with the capability to spread further to the ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) and contralateral mediastinal (N3) nodes. The frequency of lymphatic involvement in patients with pulmonary metastases has not been fully characterized, in part because a systematic lymph node dissection has not been considered a standard approach in this setting. In retrospective reviews, unsuspected metastatic disease in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes was revealed in 5 to 33 percent of cases, depending on histology (more common in patients with carcinoma than sarcoma) [<a href="#rid3">3,26-28,33-36</a>]. </p><p>Lymph node involvement is an important negative prognostic factor for pulmonary metastasectomy, regardless of histology. Surgical or endoscopic staging of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes prior to pulmonary metastasectomy provides both diagnostic and prognostic information. We agree with guidelines from the STS that recommend regional nodal sampling for evaluation of nodal metastases prior to attempted pulmonary metastasectomy in the presence of suspicious N1 or N2 nodes on preoperative staging imaging and for clinically node-negative tumors associated with nodal disease spread (ie, renal cell, breast, colorectal carcinoma, and melanoma) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Operative staging'</a> below and <a class="local">'Lymphadenectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, N3 nodal involvement represents a contraindication to potentially curative metastasectomy for any histology. Outcomes are generally poorer for those with N2 rather than just intrapulmonary or hilar nodal involvement, and we consider N2 involvement to represent a contraindication to pulmonary metastasectomy for tumors other than renal cell cancer [<a href="#rid27">27,28,30,32,35</a>]. For patients with renal cell cancer and N2 nodal metastases, the decision to pursue pulmonary metastasectomy along with surgical lymphadenectomy must be individualized. The prognosis is also worse compared with those who have intrapulmonary or hilar nodes, but not all patients with N2 disease and renal cell cancer are destined to recur [<a href="#rid22">22,37,38</a>]. As an example, in one report of 122 patients undergoing systematic lymph node dissection prior to lung metastasectomy for renal cell cancer, median survival was shorter for those with mediastinal as compared with hilar-only nodal metastases (74 versus 32 months), but long-term survival could be achieved in some cases [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2796.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology"</a>.)</p><p>Lymphadenectomy is discussed in further detail below. (See <a class="local">'Lymphadenectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23500974"><span class="h2">Repeat metastasectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For both epithelial cancers [<a href="#rid23">23</a>] and sarcomas [<a href="#rid39">39</a>], the most frequent site of relapse following pulmonary resection is in the lung. In general, sequential resections can be carried out safely to treat isolated recurrences [<a href="#rid3">3,17</a>]. Repeat metastasectomy should be strongly considered for slow-growing or few metastases, provided the patient can tolerate repeat surgeries and will have adequate cardiopulmonary reserve [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>The role of repeat metastasectomy has been evaluated retrospectively [<a href="#rid3">3,41,42</a>]. The largest series, the International Registry of Lung Metastases, found that 53 percent of the 5206 patients undergoing resection of pulmonary metastases relapsed in the lung [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Among the 1042 patients who underwent repeat metastasectomy, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 44 and 29 percent, respectively. In contrast, the median survival among patients who were not resected following relapse in one series was eight months [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>These reports suggest that repeat surgery can reestablish control in the chest in carefully selected patients.

Metastatic nodules are typically well-circumscribed, spherical deposits with smooth margins and are predominantly subpleural or located in the outer third of the lung fields.

In patients with highly suspicious lesions that have a characteristic CT appearance (eg, round, peripheral, multiple), definitive tissue diagnosis is often made after surgical resection of the metastases. However, in many cases, preoperative CT-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a useful means to obtain tissue less invasively, particularly if the diagnosis of metastatic disease is in question, the patient is a poor or borderline operative candidate, or the patient has a primary tumor (eg, testicular germ cell tumor, lymphoma) for which surgery may not be necessary.</p><p>Particularly for lesions less than 1 cm in size, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be useful to establish a diagnosis.

Bronchoscopy should be performed preoperatively when positive findings would contraindicate operative intervention. For patients who require general anesthesia, bronchoscopy is performed in the operating room as a component of a staging procedure prior to metastasectomy.

In this manner, patients who rapidly develop extrapulmonary metastases can be spared the morbidity of unnecessary thoracic surgery. This also ensures that a small number of mature (eg, large and fairly uniform in size) target lesions have not evolved into innumerable lesions with a constellation of sizes, which may change the surgical approach. </p><p>Patients with one or more pulmonary metastases are likely to develop additional pulmonary lesions over time. Following potentially curative metastasectomy, additional lesions are identified in 50 percent of cases due to the subsequent growth of previously undetectable lesions. Smaller lesions have a shorter doubling time and, therefore, a faster growth rate than larger lesions [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. New lesions are recognized when these tumor deposits grow and become recognizable as different from surrounding lung tissue [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Delaying intervention once a pulmonary metastasis is first identified may allow initially occult metastases to become clinically apparent, permitting a more complete resection and better long-term outcomes. This was illustrated in a retrospective review of 68 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. On multivariate analysis, the only independently significant prognostic factor for survival was longer interval (greater than twelve weeks) from detection of pulmonary metastases to resection. </p><p>Timing for metastasectomy, however, may depend upon the anticipated surgical approach (open versus minimally invasive). For those with a deep nodule or numerous nodules of varying sizes that might require open thoracotomy, which is associated with longer recovery and more morbidity, allowing the full extent of disease to be revealed by delaying open surgery may be beneficial for the patient. In this situation, we delay open surgical intervention for six to eight weeks in order to evaluate the natural history of untreated disease through repeat CT scanning. On the other hand, we may choose <strong>not</strong> to delay a VATS metastasectomy for an isolated peripheral nodule in a favorable location because recovery time and surgical risk are minimal, and recurrent disease is technically easier to resect with a repeat VATS approach because of fewer adhesions. The finding of equivalent long-term survival rates for recurrent disease following VATS or open metastasectomy implies that there may be little clinical significance to micronodules missed with initial VATS that are resected at a later date [<a href="#rid55">55,56</a>].

We agree with guidelines from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) that recommend regional nodal sampling for evaluation of nodal metastases prior to attempted pulmonary metastasectomy in the presence of suspicious N1 or N2 nodes on preoperative staging imaging [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]; we also perform this for clinically node-negative carcinomas associated with a higher frequency of nodal disease spread (ie, renal cell, colorectal carcinoma, breast cancer, and melanoma). Most clinicians consider the presence of confirmed mediastinal (N2) nodal metastases to represent a contraindication to metastasectomy because of the poor long-term outcome, at least for tumors other than renal cell cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945" href="/z/d/graphic/73945.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In contrast, the presence of hilar or intrapulmonary nodal metastases is not necessarily a contraindication to metastasectomy (especially for renal cell cancer) as long as anatomic resection is possible.

Pneumonectomy should be discouraged as it is uncommonly curative in this setting. Whether to choose VATS or an open thoracotomy approach depends upon characteristics of the metastases, including their location, number, and size as well as lesion stability as judged on CT scan. A conservative approach, removing the least amount of lung tissue needed to render the patient free of disease, results in greater cardiopulmonary reserve to withstand subsequent treatments should there be a recurrence. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4076527449"><span class="h3">VATS versus open surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Open thoracotomy was traditionally the standard for resection of pulmonary metastases to allow for bimanual palpation of the lungs. However, with improved imaging techniques that can detect smaller lesions with greater accuracy, VATS is gaining popularity. In our view (and that of the STS [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]), minimally invasive approaches are preferred.</p><p>Retrospective studies have demonstrated equivalent overall survival between VATS versus thoracotomy, with the former associated with improved perioperative outcomes.

There is no clear recommendation regarding what is considered an adequate margin for metastasectomies. Various recommendations have been made over the years, with some citing a wedge-shaped resection with clear margins 0.5 to 1 cm in all directions [<a href="#rid52">52</a>] and others recommending a margin of at least 1 cm and tumor/margin ratios less than 1.7 for wedge resections [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. </p><p>An adequate margin is usually easily accomplished if the metastasis is peripheral (eg, outer third of lung field as seen on chest CT). For more centrally located lesions, an adequate margin may not be achieved, because excessive tissue tension will prevent the closure of the remaining lung tissue. Thus, central lesions are often better approached with either segmentectomy or lobectomy, and open thoracotomy may be preferred, though lobectomy can also be performed using VATS. </p><p>Wedge resection is often sufficient for peripheral nodules, but segmentectomy, lobectomy, or even pneumonectomy may be required for lesions at the hilum or in the central part of the lobe. The mortality of pulmonary surgery is related to the amount of lung tissue removed, with mortality rates of 4 to 10 percent for pneumonectomy, and consistently less than 1 percent following wedge resection. These mortality rates do not differ from those associated with resection for lung adenocarcinoma [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>In general, a wedge resection by VATS is most appropriate for stable, peripheral metastases, each of which is no greater than 3 cm in size. There should be a small number of nodules; a single metastasis is ideal. Numerous target lesions may preclude a VATS approach, although there is no consensus among thoracic surgical oncologists or sarcoma specialists as to what disease burden represents an insurmountable obstacle.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4044916853"><span class="h2">VATS procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Minimally invasive approaches to thoracic surgery have become increasingly popular and can be described as "thoracoscopic" or "video-assisted." Thoracoscopic surgery involves multiple ports, but none larger than a fingerbreadth, while video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery often incorporates a minithoracotomy incision no longer than the length of a finger (10 cm). Minimally invasive techniques are often collectively referred to as "VATS" (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery), although the literature is variable, and terminology is not standardized [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. We will use the term "VATS" to refer to techniques not using standard thoracic incisions. </p><p>The first series using VATS to perform metastasectomy was reported in 1993 [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. Thoracoscopy involves the passage of a videoscope through the chest wall, giving the surgeon a "window" for direct visualization into the chest. Additional ports are placed through the chest wall to allow for various instruments. VATS is less invasive than open thoracotomy; however, like thoracotomy, it must be performed in the operating room under general anesthesia with single-lung ventilation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4388.html" rel="external">"Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy): Equipment, procedure, and complications"</a>.)</p><p>Because of fewer and smaller incisions, VATS is associated with less pain, faster postoperative recovery, shortened hospital stay, and decreased long-term morbidity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54065" href="/z/d/graphic/54065.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Intrathoracic postoperative adhesions are milder with VATS compared with open thoracotomy. VATS has the advantage of shortened recuperation time and decreased blood loss in patients who require repeat resection after recurrence [<a href="#rid64">64</a>].</p><p>VATS can be used to resect most metastatic lesions as the majority are located in the peripheral one-third of the lung [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Conversion from a VATS approach to an open thoracotomy is appropriate for lesions located more centrally or whenever the completeness of resection is in doubt. Intrathoracic recurrence rates of clinically significant disease are reported to be between 18 and 49 percent for VATS, similar to that reported with open thoracotomy (16 to 53 percent) [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. </p><p>To avoid intrathoracic and port site seeding, the resected specimen should be placed intact into a sterile specimen bag before being delivered through the port site. It is important to examine the cut surface of the resected specimen to confirm that the resection margin is free of tumor; frozen-section histologic analysis should be undertaken when indicated. </p><p>As discussed above, there is no consensus regarding a preference for open thoracotomy over a VATS procedure. Some argue that thoracoscopic resection is a valid approach only for patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule on preoperative chest CT, where the risk of additional disease is small [<a href="#rid66">66-69</a>]. On the other hand, proponents of VATS argue that while open surgical exploration identifies radiographically occult nodules, these can be resected with VATS in the future, once they become detectable on surveillance CT scans, without adversely affecting survival. A review of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons database from 2007 to 2019 identified 8868 patients who underwent a pulmonary metastasectomy (63.5 percent thoracotomy and 36.5 percent VATS) [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. Notably, the rate of VATS procedure increased from 15 percent in 2007 to 58 percent in 2018. So, although a clear consensus has not been reached regarding preferably performing VATS versus thoracotomy for pulmonary metastasectomy, VATS is slowly gaining popularity. (See <a class="local">'Repeat metastasectomy'</a> above.) </p><p>However, a VATS option that offers access to both sides of the chest cavity as well as manual palpation involves the use of a subxiphoid port. While reportedly used for bilateral pulmonary resection, the learning curve is steeper compared with use of a standard transthoracic incision [<a href="#rid59">59,71-73</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15141.html" rel="external">"Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery", section on 'Incisions'</a>.) </p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing outcomes between open and thoracoscopic resection and few retrospective comparisons. Data suggest that patients do at least as well after VATS as after thoracotomy and imply that there is little if any clinical significance to skipped nodules. However, because these favorable outcomes from VATS were obtained predominantly in populations with a limited disease extent, many surgeons restrict VATS to patients with a single or very few pulmonary metastases. Available studies are inherently biased because patients with single metastases are more often offered VATS.</p><p>Specific data illustrating these points include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective cohort study of 186 patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy (36 with VATS and 135 via thoracotomy), five-year overall survival (70 versus 59 percent) and recurrence-free survival (67 versus 51 percent) were not worse after VATS [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].

The recurrence rate was lower for VATS patients compared with thoracotomy patients (12.7 versus 22.3 percent), but the observed difference was not significant.

Open thoracotomy exposes the chest cavity, facilitating bimanual palpation of the pulmonary parenchyma, and resection of visible and palpable metastases. </p><p>A bilateral approach is indicated only for those patients who present radiographically with bilateral metastases. For patients who appear to have unilateral disease, inspection of both hemithoraces frequently identifies occult tumor deposits. However, bilateral exploration and resection has not produced a survival advantage compared with a unilateral approach [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. Further, recurrence in the ipsilateral lung was as common as recurrence in the contralateral lung in patients who underwent bilateral exploration with complete resection to treat unilateral disease.</p><p>The open approach options to patients with known bilateral lesions are median sternotomy, bilateral anterior thoracotomies (clamshell incision), or bilateral sequential thoracotomies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54065" href="/z/d/graphic/54065.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sternotomy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86046" href="/z/d/graphic/86046.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) allows the simultaneous examination of both lungs and identification and treatment of contralateral occult disease.

In a systematic review, available studies included between 9 and 42 patients with five-year survival rates that ranged from 10 to 41 percent [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. A later retrospective review of 1027 patients who underwent lung metastasectomy included 29 patients who had extended pulmonary resections for epithelial (62.1 percent) and sarcomatous (20.7 percent) tumors [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. Procedures included three resections of the chest wall, one azygos, one diaphragm, four vascular resections/reconstructions, six sleeve resections, and 14 pneumonectomies. Perioperative morbidity (30 day) and mortality were 38 (11 of 29) and 0 percent, respectively. Only one patient had a major complication due to a bronchopleural fistula. Overall survival following a complete extended metastasectomy at two years was 66 percent, at five years was 42 percent, and at 10 years was 36 percent. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h2">Lymphadenectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The need for routine systematic lymph node sampling during pulmonary metastasectomy is controversial. We agree with guidelines from the STS that recommend regional nodal sampling for evaluation of nodal metastases prior to attempted pulmonary metastasectomy in the presence of suspicious N1 or N2 nodes on preoperative staging imaging and for clinically node-negative carcinomas associated with nodal disease spread (ie, renal cell, breast, colorectal carcinoma, and melanoma) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>As noted above, contralateral mediastinal nodal involvement represents a contraindication to potentially curative metastasectomy in a unilaterally affected lung for any histology. Outcomes are generally poorer in those with N2 (ipsilateral mediastinal) rather than just intrapulmonary or hilar nodal involvement, and we consider this to represent a contraindication to pulmonary metastasectomy for tumors other than renal cell cancer. For patients with renal cell cancer and ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) nodal metastases, the decision to pursue pulmonary metastasectomy along with surgical lymphadenectomy must be individualized. (See <a class="local">'Lymph node spread'</a> above.)</p><p>In general, there are few long-term survivors among those with N2 disease, leading many to conclude that documentation of mediastinal nodal involvement represents a contraindication to potentially curative pulmonary metastasectomy, regardless of histology [<a href="#rid27">27,28,30,32,35</a>]. However, although there are no randomized trials in which patients either did or did not undergo mediastinal node dissection prior to pulmonary metastasectomy, successful removal of involved nodes can produce a complete resection with negative margins, which may contribute to the success of the surgery. Leaving an involved node is equivalent to having a positive margin. There are at least some data that suggest that long-term survival is possible for some patients, especially those with renal cell cancer with mediastinal (N2) nodal disease, although outcomes are worse than if nodal disease is limited to the hilar and intrapulmonary (N1) nodes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945" href="/z/d/graphic/73945.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The bias at the authors' institutions has been to treat such malignancies according to their biologic behavior, which includes a willingness to diagnose N2 and N3 disease by endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or cervical mediastinoscopy. It also includes a surgical plan to resect these metastases with anatomic resections to achieve a local lymphadenectomy in the surgical specimen. Removal of perihilar nodes can frequently be accomplished by thoracoscopic enucleation, while removal of nodes between the vessels and segmental bronchi often requires segmentectomy or lobectomy. We also perform a mediastinal lymphadenectomy in these cases.</p><p>Documentation of N2 nodal diseases may make nonsurgical treatment alternatives (such as chemotherapy, radiation, or radiofrequency ablation) more attractive because of the lower perceived benefit of surgery in this situation. Although some have suggested that knowing the status of the regional nodes can guide adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], the presence of nodal metastases does not change medical management for the vast majority of tumor types metastasizing to the lung (sarcoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, germ cell tumor).

Retrospective experience has shown that the overall actuarial 5- and 10-year survival rates after complete metastasectomy are approximately 36 and 26 percent, respectively. (See <a class="local">'Benefits of resection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient selection</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For appropriately selected patients, we suggest surgical resection of lung metastases rather than palliative systemic therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Optimal outcomes are highly dependent on appropriate patient selection. Where possible, all cases should be reviewed at a multidisciplinary tumor board prior to scheduling surgical metastasectomy.

Particularly for synchronous metastatic disease, a delay of two to three months in metastasectomy is reasonable to allow the natural history of the disease to become manifest. (See <a class="local">'Factors that may influence the decision'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Outcomes are better with fewer metastases. However, there is no consensus as to what disease burden represents an insurmountable obstacle. The more important issue is the feasibility of resecting all sites of disease rather than absolute number. However, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) consensus group considers pulmonary metastasectomy to be best suited to patients harboring three or fewer metastases.

The need for delay in patients planned for a VATS procedure is less clear. We frequently choose not to delay a VATS metastasectomy for an isolated peripheral nodule in a favorable location.

This can be accomplished either with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy or mediastinoscopy prior to surgery.
