Middle ear disease may be due, at least in part, to failure or inadequacy of ET function.</p><p>A normally functioning ET ventilates the middle ear space, allows drainage of middle ear secretions, and protects the middle ear from sound and the reflux of nasopharyngeal contents [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. ET dysfunction represents a spectrum of disease ranging from obstructive dysfunction, in which there is failure to open to provide adequate ventilation to the middle ear, to the opposite extreme, patulous dysfunction, in which there is failure of the ET to close. It has become increasingly clear that the underlying pathophysiology that causes ET dysfunction may lead to either obstructive or patulous pathology, and that patients may move back and forth on this spectrum, creating difficulties in diagnosis and appropriate treatment; careful evaluation is necessary to make the correct diagnosis.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of ET dysfunction. Specific diseases associated with ET dysfunction are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6872.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15312.html" rel="external">"Chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6844.html" rel="external">"Etiology of hearing loss in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6845.html" rel="external">"Ear barotrauma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6009.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5959.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5998.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Prevention of recurrence"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87008.html" rel="external">"Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2342827"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Eustachian tube (ET) originates from the anterior wall of the middle ear cavity (called the protympanum) and passes anteroinferiorly to open into the nasopharynx  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66873" href="/z/d/graphic/66873.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef138977" href="/z/d/graphic/138977.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The nasopharyngeal and tympanic ends are wider than the middle of the ET, with the bony isthmus being the narrowest portion. The ET passes superiorly, posteriorly, and laterally from the nasopharynx to the middle ear [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Its total length in adults ranges from 36 to 38 mm. Children have shorter, more horizontal tubes, immature floppy elastic cartilage, and larger adenoids compared with adults. This places them at a higher risk for ET obstruction as well as reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions and pathogens  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63920" href="/z/d/graphic/63920.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The ET in children usually reaches adult length by age 8 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], but function may continue to mature with further development of the skull. In addition, the height of the ET orifice above the floor of the nasal cavity appears to reach adult dimension around age 18.</p><p>The ET is not a static pipe; it is a dynamic structure with a lumen, skeleton, mucosal lining, and surrounding soft tissue and muscles  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70595" href="/z/d/graphic/70595.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. The skeleton of the tube is formed of cartilage in its inferior and medial two-thirds, and bone in the superior and lateral one-third. The bony portion lies within the petrous part of the temporal bone, while the cartilaginous portion is firmly attached superiorly to the sphenoid bone [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The bony portion is normally patent and does not open and close dynamically as does the cartilaginous portion [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Within the bone and cartilage are the four muscles related to ET function: tensor veli palatini (TVP), levator veli palatini (LVP), tensor tympani, and salpingopharyngeus. The most important muscles for tube dilation are the TVP, the principal active tubal dilator, and the LVP, which sets the cartilaginous skeleton into position against which the TVP can complete the dilation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The anterolateral wall is membranous and consists of the luminal mucosa, submucosa, adipose tissue (called Ostmann’s fat pad), and the TVP muscle [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The mucosal lining of the ET is continuous with the rest of the respiratory tract.</p><p>Viewing the ET orifice from the nasopharynx with an endoscope  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53444" href="/z/d/graphic/53444.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), the lumen lies just anterior and lateral to the posterior cushion. The adenoid pad is situated in the midline of the nasopharynx [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11700761"><span class="h1">NORMAL EUSTACHIAN TUBE FUNCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Eustachian tube (ET) has three functional roles [<a href="#rid1">1,2,8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Equalization of pressure across the tympanic membrane (TM), which is considered the most important function of the ET, as gas pressure homeostasis is essential for optimal auditory function</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Protection of the middle ear from infection and reflux of nasopharyngeal contents</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clearance of middle ear secretions</p><p></p><p>These three functions are mediated by opening and closing of the ET  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66208" href="/z/d/graphic/66208.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). The tube ordinarily opens with swallowing and yawning, which occur approximately 84 times per hour while awake and less frequently during sleep [<a href="#rid8">8,10</a>], although not every swallow or yawn is accompanied by ET opening.</p><p>The recoiling memory properties of the cartilaginous ET, relaxing bulk of the tensor veli palatini (TVP) muscle, and pressure of neighboring extraluminal tissue cause the tube to close passively. The closed tube lumen is likely maintained by these factors, as well as by the overlying Ostmann’s fat pad and the surface tension of the apposed wet mucosal surfaces, which in aggregate serve as a functional valve that opens intermittently for ventilation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This functional valve in the middle of the cartilaginous portion of the tube is roughly 15 to 20 mm in length [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11700640"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction can be separated into three pathophysiologic processes: pressure dysregulation/impaired ventilation, impaired protective function, and impaired clearance [<a href="#rid1">1,2,6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2342881"><span class="h2">Pressure dysregulation/impaired ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ET may fail to open adequately to allow for ventilation of the middle ear space, leading to pressure dysregulation [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Failure of the ET to open generally occurs due to functional or anatomic obstruction.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional obstruction</strong> – Functional obstruction refers to compromise of normal tubal dilation in the absence of a fixed physical blockage of the lumen. Chronic functional obstruction is most commonly due to mucosal inflammation with edema and secretions which limit the ability of the functional valve to open.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Less commonly, failure of muscular actions may limit the dilatory ability of the ET [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Impaired muscular function is common in cleft palate and other craniofacial syndromes in which the abnormal muscular and skull anatomy lead to reduced efficiency of the dilation action [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. True muscular dysfunction or weakness can also occur in conditions such as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or myasthenia gravis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5136.html" rel="external">"Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease", section on 'Clinical symptoms and signs'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2920.html" rel="external">"Overview of craniofacial clefts and holoprosencephaly", section on 'Problems associated with clefts'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the middle ear, negative pressure is induced by the continuous absorption of middle ear gasses and can also be exacerbated under certain circumstances (eg, descent during air travel, scuba diving). It can also occur secondary to behaviors such as habitual sniffing and thumb sucking with obstructed nasal passages. Further, the negative pressure present within the elastic ET makes it more difficult for the tubal muscles to dilate the lumen. A functionally impaired ET may be able to partially open, but dilation may be insufficient to adequately ventilate the continually accumulating negative pressure within the middle ear. Once excessive negative pressure occurs within the middle ear, it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle in which the absence of ET opening makes it increasingly difficult to dilate the tube, and the failure to open further increases the negative pressure. Unless this cycle is interrupted, pressures may exceed negative 400 dekapascals (daPa) and cause transudate to fill the space. Conversely, positive middle ear pressure (relative to ambient pressure, as occurs with ascending from deep water, in an airplane, or in the mountains), facilitates opening of the tubal lumen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomic obstruction</strong> – True anatomic obstruction occurs infrequently. Intrinsic obstruction may be due to severe inflammation with swelling of mucosa, polyps, or neoplasms within the ET lumen; synechiae (intranasal adhesions or scar tissue); or congenital or acquired stenosis. ET lumen or orifice obliteration is most commonly the result of trauma but can also be a complication of surgical procedures, such as adenoidectomy, turbinectomy and maxillary osteotomy. It can also occur from inflammatory disease (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA] and mucosal pemphigus). Extrinsic obstruction can occur from a large adenoidal mass or nasopharyngeal neoplasm. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4330.html" rel="external">"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis: Respiratory tract involvement", section on 'Nasal, sinus, and ear disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3404.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, etiology, and diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83684.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pemphigus", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3117.html" rel="external">"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Ear, nose, and throat involvement'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2344336"><span class="h2">Impaired protective function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ET normally protects against the reflux of nasopharyngeal pathogens, allergy-inducing proteins, and gastric secretions into the middle ear. If refluxed gastric secretions reach the ET, there may be loss of mucosal protection; nasopharyngeal and ET mucosa do not contain the protective proteins found in the stomach mucosa. The ET also serves to limit hearing the sounds of one's own breathing and speaking (autophony).</p><p>Protection against reflux depends upon competence of the functional valve of the ET. Valve closure progresses proximally to distally (from the ear toward the nasopharyngeal orifice), creating a pumping action that further serves to prevent reflux [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>ET reflux occurs in the following conditions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An abnormally patent ET (congenital or acquired).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Short, "floppy" ETs, as typically seen in young children and in some patients with craniofacial anomalies. Bottle-fed children are at higher risk for ET reflux compared with breast-fed children, especially if conventional nonventilated bottles are used [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6021.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, and complications", section on 'Risk and protective factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated pressure in the nasopharynx can force material into the tube lumen; nasopharyngeal obstruction, blowing the nose, and crying can induce abnormal positive pressures at the nasopharyngeal end of the tube.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2344353"><span class="h2">Impaired clearance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Impaired ET mucociliary function can result in the inability to clear viscous material and pathogens from the middle ear.</p><p>Loss of ciliary function can occur from bacteria and bacterial toxins, viruses, smoking, toxin exposure, allergic disease, and other sources of inflammation [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Ciliary function may also be impaired in inflammatory conditions such as Samter's triad (ie, asthma, nasal polyps, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> sensitivity). Less commonly, primary loss of mucociliary function occurs in cystic fibrosis and other ciliary dysmotility disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6367.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Sinus and nasopharyngeal disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4338.html" rel="external">"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (immotile-cilia syndrome)", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/520.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease", section on 'Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis'</a>.)</p><p>Copious or viscous mucosal secretions within the middle ear and ET lumen may impair the adequate expulsion of pathogens from the middle ear.</p><p>ET clearance can have postural variation as well. Venous engorgement occurs when the head is in a dependent position; this may not be physiologically significant for most people, but patients with a patulous ET (in which the functional valve fails to close) may find symptomatic relief by lying down.</p><p>Impaired ET clearance may also have a seasonal variation due to the increased incidence of upper respiratory infections in the fall and winter months, as well as seasonal environmental allergies (eg, pollens in spring and summer and dust and molds in fall and winter) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2342888"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIES OF EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601998979"><span class="h2">Spectrum of Eustachian tube dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction represents a spectrum of disease ranging from obstructive dysfunction, in which there is failure of opening to provide adequate ventilation to the middle ear, to the opposite extreme, patulous dysfunction, in which there is failure of the ET to close [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Obstructive dysfunction is believed to be responsible for a large proportion of otitis media and chronic ear disease and is more common than patulous dysfunction. However, patulous dysfunction is probably far more common than previously realized [<a href="#rid20">20</a>], and it can cause bothersome symptoms that may be mistaken for obstructive dysfunction. Although the symptoms may be profoundly disturbing to patients, patulous dysfunction generally does not lead to any significant acute or chronic ear disease.</p><p>It has become increasingly clear that the underlying pathophysiology that causes ET dysfunction may lead to either obstructive or patulous pathology and that patients may move back and forth on this spectrum, creating difficulties in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. For example, in a series of 239 ETs with patulous dysfunction, 30 percent had evidence of chronic ear disease associated with past obstructive ET dysfunction, including tympanosclerosis, middle ear effusion, fixed retraction pockets, atelectasis of the tympanic membrane (TM), and cholesteatoma [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. A careful evaluation is thus necessary to establish a correct diagnosis.</p><p>In some cases, however, the etiology of ET dysfunction is not identified, and the condition may resolve spontaneously without ever being diagnosed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2342897"><span class="h3">Obstructive dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obstructive ET dysfunction is defined as the impaired ability to equalize pressure between the middle ear and nasopharynx, often associated with visible retraction of the TM or evidence of negative pressure in the middle ear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52819" href="/z/d/graphic/52819.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>There are several well-described factors that are associated with obstructive failure of the ET in both adults and children [<a href="#rid8">8,19,22</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Any cause of inflammation affecting the oropharyngeal mucosa:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infection affecting the adenoids, nasopharynx, nose, and sinuses.

It is estimated that 6 to 7 percent of the population has some degree of patulous ET dysfunction [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p>Differentiating between obstructive and patulous conditions is important in order to offer the appropriate treatment. The differential diagnosis can be challenging; patients will often complain of blockage or aural fullness or pressure and may not volunteer symptoms of autophony. Furthermore, many patients initially suffer from obstructive ET dysfunction but can progress to patulous dysfunction over time. This may be due to atrophy of the ET luminal mucosa and submucosa that also occurs within the nose and sinuses [<a href="#rid28">28-30</a>].</p><p>Several associated and causative factors have been reported [<a href="#rid11">11,31-36</a>].

The diagnosis can be confirmed by nasal endoscopy and audiology studies. Other tests assessing for the etiology of the dysfunction are conducted based upon the patient's clinical situation (eg, allergy testing in a patient with persistent allergic symptoms). When available, additional testing modalities such as tympanometry, sonotubometry, and tubomanometry may aid diagnosing ET dysfunction, although there is no gold standard diagnostic test [<a href="#rid1">1,21</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p>Many patients, particularly younger children, do not complain of ear problems but are discovered incidentally to have otitis media with effusion (OME) on a routine examination. In children ages 6 and older who have OME, allergies causing obstructive ET dysfunction should be suspected [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Additionally, in children who have delayed speech or language development or abnormal hearing screening tests, ET dysfunction should be considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2342918"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the evaluation of possible ET dysfunction, we inquire about specific symptoms, particularly those that may distinguish obstructive from patulous tubal dysfunction, as well as underlying causes and possible complications. (See <a class="local">'Complications of Eustachian tube dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Hallmarks of obstructive ET dysfunction include symptoms during baro-challenge (eg, consistent difficulty equalizing ear pressure during air travel or with altitude changes) and a history of otitis media. Additional symptoms may include ear pain, a sensation of aural fullness or pressure, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Patients commonly describe their ear(s) as feeling "plugged" and may also report ear popping and snapping noises. Vertigo and disequilibrium may be reported in severe cases of negative pressure or in association with otitis media.</p><p>Patulous ET dysfunction can be asymptomatic or may present with symptoms that range from minimal and intermittent to persistent and severely disturbing; for some patients, symptoms may be disabling. In patulous ET dysfunction, patients classically experience a loud perception of their own internal sounds (autophony), most specifically of their own voice and breathing (autophony can be simulated by listening through a stethoscope while talking, or while breathing close to the stethoscope diaphragm). The patient may describe hearing their own voice as if "talking into a barrel.” For patients, hearing one’s own voice is generally more bothersome than hearing one's own breathing sounds. Symptoms of patulous dysfunction often fluctuate. For example, they may be relieved with the head in a dependent position and may be aggravated by activities that cause mucosal dehydration, such as exercise and prolonged speaking or singing. There can be a decongestive effect on mucosa from the epinephrine-like hormones released with exercise [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Pulsatile tinnitus is also common in patulous ET dysfunction. Importantly, patients with patulous dysfunction may also complain of aural fullness similar to patients with obstructive dysfunction.</p><p>We inquire about symptoms and pertinent medical history that may suggest a direct cause of or exacerbating factors for the ET dysfunction.

In addition, forceful nose blowing or autoinsufflation can force the ET open, but repetition over time may distend and weaken the ET and potentially result in a patulous tube.</p><p>The ET dysfunction questionnaire (ETDQ-7) is a validated seven-item scoring questionnaire for rating the severity of symptoms associated with ET obstructive dysfunction. It assesses ear pressure, ear pain, sensation of clogging, ear symptoms with a cold or sinusitis, popping or crackling sensation, ringing in the ear, and muffled hearing. In a small sample of patients, it had reasonable validity in distinguishing patients with and without ET dysfunction compared with tympanometry [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. However, it is a nonspecific instrument that cannot distinguish between obstructive and patulous ET dysfunction; it cannot be used as a diagnostic aid, and it is best used to compare pre- and posttreatment symptom scores as an outcome measure [<a href="#rid1">1,40</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2342934"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We perform a focused head and neck examination, including a hearing evaluation, on every patient with a possible ET problem.

However, normal otoscopic findings do not rule out ET disease.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Otoscopy</strong> – With the patient seated upright, we perform an ear examination using an otoscope, with attention to the TM. A normal TM has a shiny translucent appearance  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626" href="/z/d/graphic/52626.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). A dull bluish gray or yellowish coloration denotes an effusion behind the TM; an air-fluid level may also be seen  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103802" href="/z/d/graphic/103802.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). A reddish coloration and engorged TM vessels may indicate inflammation, although straining (eg, a child crying or blowing their nose) can also lead to visibly engorged vessels. The light reflection on the anteroinferior quadrant of the TM is not a reliable indicator of changes in the TM, as it is often present despite significant pathology. Scarring and thickening of the TM can alter the shape of the cone of light, so the entire TM should be evaluated systematically.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The short process of malleus is visible as a mild protrusion near the "twelve-o-clock" position in the healthy transparent TM  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626" href="/z/d/graphic/52626.html" rel="external">picture 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57110" href="/z/d/graphic/57110.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). With high negative pressure, the TM is retracted, the short process appears more prominent, and the manubrium (or handle) of the malleus appears shorter because it is medially rotated  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52819" href="/z/d/graphic/52819.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>).

Any of these findings can be seen with obstructive ET dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, we observe the TM for movement with respiration. When there is an actively patulous ET, excursions of an intact (ie, nonperforated) TM will accompany the patient's breathing, especially if the contralateral nostril is held closed. Lying in the supine position may temporarily close the ET with the patulous defect and eliminate the breathing-induced excursions. Thus, it is important to perform the otoscopic examination with the patient in an upright position.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We suspect patulous dysfunction in patients who are observed to be frequently sniffing yet have evidence of negative middle ear pressure on examination. Such sniffing represents attempts to close patulous ETs by temporarily generating enough negative pressure to close the ET lumen. The resultant negative pressure, however, may be severe enough to cause retraction of the TM  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52819" href="/z/d/graphic/52819.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) and even middle ear effusion and ultimately middle ear cholesteatoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pneumatic otoscopy</strong> – The ear examination is greatly aided with pneumatic otoscopy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93798" href="/z/d/graphic/93798.html" rel="external">picture 14</a>). With gentle application of positive and then negative pressure with the pneumatic otoscope, a normal, intact (nonperforated) TM moves inwards then outwards respectively  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55117" href="/z/d/graphic/55117.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>).

In the absence of subjective hearing loss, a screening hearing evaluation can be done with a whispered voice test, or if available, a tone-emitting otoscope. For patients with subjective hearing loss or hearing loss detected with a whispered voice test or tone-emitting otoscope, tuning fork evaluation can determine if the hearing loss is conductive or sensorineural  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032" href="/z/d/graphic/58032.html" rel="external">figure 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212" href="/z/d/graphic/74212.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For all patients with hearing loss, formal audiology testing is necessary to determine the nature and extent of the hearing loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6850.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of hearing loss in adults", section on 'Office hearing evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6297.html" rel="external">"Hearing loss in children: Screening and evaluation", section on 'Evaluation of the child with hearing loss'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Conductive hearing loss commonly occurs with obstructive, but not typically with patulous ET dysfunction. However, patients with patulous ET might complain of subjective hearing loss as their hearing is being “distracted” (ie, masked) by autophony.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nasal endoscopy</strong> – Nasal endoscopy, typically performed by an otolaryngologist, may provide helpful diagnostic information in some patients, such as those with severe ear complaints (eg, significant hearing loss or intense otalgia), recurrent otitis media (including acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion [OME]), and persistent unilateral otitis media with effusion. Endoscopy can be used to evaluate the nasopharynx as well as ET anatomy and function. (See <a class="local">'When to refer to a specialist'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We find it useful to begin the examination using the flexible endoscope and, if more detailed views are needed, the rigid endoscopes (30 or 45 degree view angle) may be used to provide the optimal view. The flexible endoscope is first used to survey the nasal cavity and inspect the sinus orifices for inflammation, secretions, or allergic manifestations. The nasopharynx is also examined for evidence of enlarged or inflamed adenoids or other masses. The relationship of any adenoidal mass to the posterior cushion is noted to determine if may cause impingement on tubal opening at rest or with swallowing. The endoscope is then passed towards the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx to check for evidence of acid reflux, such as thickening, edema, and erythema of the vocal cords.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Examination of the ET is performed last. The best view into the ET lumen is often obtained by passing the flexible endoscope from the contralateral nares, curving around the vomer bone to come in line with the longitudinal axis of the ET  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52732" href="/z/d/graphic/52732.html" rel="external">picture 15</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79152" href="/z/d/graphic/79152.html" rel="external">picture 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53444" href="/z/d/graphic/53444.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Patients are asked to perform a series of swallows and yawns to assess the quality and dynamics of the opening of the tube  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66208" href="/z/d/graphic/66208.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). The lumen is inspected with an angled view to assess for inflammation and compromise of valve function. We also assess whether hypertrophy of the adenoid or tubal tonsil tissue may compromise opening of the ET during swallows due to the muscular compression exerted from the lateral pharyngeal wall. Hypertrophy of the torus tubarius or adenoid may cause anterior thrusting of the torus due to this compression, paradoxically forcing the lumen closed when it should be opening. This dynamic process will be missed unless an angled view is obtained and observation done during swallows and yawns.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tympanometry and audiometry</strong> – Both tympanometry (to measure the middle ear pressure) and pure tone audiometry (to assess for hearing loss) are important tools in evaluation of ET dysfunction; they can be used both to help diagnose ET dysfunction and to provide an objective measurement of response to therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Tympanometry is a reliable instrument that determines normal versus abnormal pressures within the middle ear; it can indirectly measure middle ear pressure by comparing changes in TM compliance with changes in external ear canal pressure. The presence of a middle ear effusion stiffens the system (decreases the compliance). Actively patulous ETs can sometimes be identified on tympanometry by a sawtoothed pattern; this reflects changes in TM compliance as the patient's breathing causes shifts in middle ear pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although audiometry is important in measuring the impact that ET dysfunction may have on hearing, these changes do not correlate with the severity of tubal pathology. Mild to moderate conductive hearing loss is expected in cases of TM retraction and middle ear effusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional testing options may assist in the diagnosis of challenging cases or in the evaluation of the severity of persistent ET dysfunction but are not universally available for clinical use. As examples, nine-step tympanometry (repeated tympanometry with a series of changes in ear canal pressure followed by swallows), sonotubometry, and tubomanometry can indicate opening of the ET, but these tests have not been shown to have a strong correlation for predicting clinical outcomes for middle ear function. Among these tests, tubomanometry has been found to be the most reliable in detecting opening of the ET; during such testing, a dry swallow yields stronger ET opening than swallowing liquids [<a href="#rid1">1,43-46</a>]. In a review of the accuracy of available tests, it was determined that each test measures different components that contribute to overall ET function, but no single test serves as a gold standard for diagnosing disorders of ET function [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H344874929"><span class="h2">Imaging for patients with persistent unilateral symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with more than three months of unilateral symptoms and a persistent middle ear effusion, imaging is indicated to rule out neoplasm, especially in adults.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast of the nasopharynx has the greatest sensitivity for neoplasms, although, if this protocol is not available, sinus or temporal bone MRI with contrast is generally acceptable.

Most nasal sprays will not reach the ET orifice in the nasopharynx; therefore, proper application of topical drops is important.</p><p>To achieve the best result, the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> drops should come directly into contact with the tubal orifice. Patients are instructed to lie supine on a bed or couch with their head just off the edge of the surface at approximately 15 degrees of neck extension. Three to four drops of saline are placed into the ipsilateral nostril with the neck still extended, the head rotated 45 degrees toward the floor to allow gravity to direct the drops to the ET orifice. (The final position resembles the Hallpike position, but with only 15 degrees of neck extension.) The patient should feel a "twinge" radiate to the ipsilateral ear when the solution makes contact with the ET orifice, although the saline does not typically enter the ear. Some patients may require more drops (ie, five to six) to feel an effect; application should be done a minimum of twice daily and as often as needed to achieve symptom control. This is done for eight weeks to achieve a lasting benefit, although we do not advise chronic use.</p><p>If regular <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> is ineffective, a hypertonic saline solution (prepared with 4 teaspoons of table salt in a cup of tap water) can be used. It is more irritating and will generate more tissue edema and mucus secretion, although not all patients can tolerate it. If necessary, the concentration can be reduced to improve tolerability.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H383461068"><span class="h4">Other</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For refractory cases, a topical ascorbic acid preparation can be used, although this is even more irritating and not tolerated by all patients [<a href="#rid84">84,85</a>].</p><p>For patients with allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, or other nasal congestion symptoms, nasal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> nasal irrigations can be helpful. </p><p>Mass loading of the tympanic membrane has been shown to help many patients, and this can be done in an office setting [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. Originally done by placing blue tack on the posterior surface of the TM, it can be more practically done by placing topical ointment or one or more stacked layers of reinforced adhesive skin closure strips.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2344699"><span class="h3">Surgery for severe, persistent symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical management of patulous dysfunction is reserved for patients with severe symptoms who do not respond to medical management (eg, adequate hydration, treatment of the underlying etiology, intranasal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tympanostomy tubes</strong> – For patients who do not respond to medical therapy, tympanostomy tube insertion may provide symptomatic relief. In our experience, patients who are bothered more by breath autophony than voice autophony are more likely to benefit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The reason for benefit from tympanostomy tube is not clear, but there is some evidence that mass loading of the tympanic membrane alters its mechanical resonance properties [<a href="#rid87">87</a>], and up to 50 percent of patients may experience symptomatic improvement [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. To determine if a patient is a candidate, a dab of ointment or a moistened paper patch can be applied to the posterior aspect of the TM as a test; if the patient derives significant relief of symptoms, we offer tympanostomy tube insertion. Sometimes patients may experience troublesome hearing distortion, however, and the tympanostomy tube can be removed if desired.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eustachian tube shim placement</strong> – For<strong> </strong>patients with patulous dysfunction who have persistent, severe symptoms despite medical therapy and tympanostomy tubes, we generally offer treatment with placement of an intraluminal catheter, or shim.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With shim placement, a sealed intravenous catheter is placed within the lumen to partially obstruct the patulous ET  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72681" href="/z/d/graphic/72681.html" rel="external">picture 18</a>). The catheter wedges into the isthmus but is not intended to completely obstruct the tube lumen; sufficient air should still be exchanged around the catheter. The shim can be sutured to the anterior pillar (anterolateral wall of the nasopharyngeal orifice) for added stability. In several case reports, this method was effective in eliminating or reducing bothersome autophony in most patients [<a href="#rid8">8,32,88</a>]. In a study evaluating different surgical procedures for patients with patulous ET, three-quarters of patients undergoing shim placement as a primary procedure had resolution of symptoms at 12 months [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. 12 percent of shims spontaneously dislodged, but symptoms did not always recur. The catheter is inert and can remain in place for long periods of time, even decades [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In the event that the shim causes obstructive ET dysfunction, a tympanostomy tube can be placed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eustachian tube augmentation</strong> – ET augmentation using calcium hydroxyapatite cement is occasionally used as another option. It is only suitable for small, favorably located defects involving the anterolateral ET wall. Most patients have a defect that is either unfavorably located in the roof of the lumen where the mucosa is too thin to hold a filler, or the defect is too large to be adequately managed using a filler. Calcium hydroxyapatite is injected under direct endoscopic view in a submucosal plane within the lumen of the ET. It increases the soft tissue bulge of the mucosal walls within the ET valve, restoring valvular competence. The filler is absorbed over approximately eight months; as the microspheres of calcium resorb, a variable amount of scar may replace some of the volume, such that repeat injections are not always required.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eustachian tube reconstruction</strong> – Reconstruction of the patulous defect using cartilage grafting is another option for patients who have persistent symptoms despite medical therapy. In cartilage grafting, endoscopic approaches are used for reconstruction of the patulous defect while preserving ET function.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cartilage grafts (eg, conchal or septal autologous cartilage or irradiated rib cartilage) are implanted to augment the concave defects that occur mostly within the posterolateral wall of the lumen. The cartilage can be implanted into a submucosal pocket, most commonly into the posteromedial wall where the cartilage skeleton of the torus tubarius serves to brace the implants. Cartilage can also be implanted into the opposite anterolateral wall (or both walls as required). Although long-term outcome data are not available [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], in observational studies the procedure has shown success, with all patients experiencing immediate relief of autophony, but with some return of symptoms in 66 percent by 12 months. In the event of return of bothersome symptoms, a second stage implantation of cartilage into the anterolateral wall may be offered, although data from staged reconstruction is not available [<a href="#rid21">21,35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Eustachian tube obliteration</strong> – For patients with persistent, intolerable symptoms despite medical therapy and all other surgical interventions, complete obliteration of the ET is a treatment of last resort. Because complete, irreversible obstruction of the ET is achieved, chronic middle ear effusions with associated autophony are common sequelae. As such, permanent tympanostomy tubes are generally required to avoid complications, including severe TM retraction, permanent effusion, or cholesteatoma [<a href="#rid32">32,35</a>]. Chronic thick mucoid effusions which can block the tympanostomy tubes can occur [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1596840350"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS OF EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications of Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction include conductive hearing loss, acute and chronic otitis media, tympanic membrane (TM) perforation, otitis media with effusion (OME), and cholesteatoma.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hearing loss</strong> – In the initial stages of ET dysfunction, the retracted TM or middle ear effusion will cause a conductive hearing loss. Restoration of tubal function at this stage will usually reverse the hearing loss and permit normal hearing function. If ET dysfunction continues, permanent TM retraction may occur, in which case full restoration of the conductive hearing loss may not occur.

For most patients with acute rupture of the TM, treatment consists of systemic antibiotics and water precautions (preventing water from entering the ear canal). TM perforations will often heal spontaneously within six weeks. However, patients with TM perforation and associated hearing loss, otorrhea, nystagmus, or persistent perforation should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

Cholesteatomas are potentially destructive to the middle and inner ear, particularly when they become infected.

The ET is a dynamic structure with a lumen, skeleton, mucosal lining, and surrounding soft tissue and muscles. The ET has three functional roles: equalization of pressure across the tympanic membrane (TM), protection of the middle ear from infection and reflux of nasopharyngeal contents, and clearance of middle ear secretions. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Normal Eustachian tube function'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spectrum of Eustachian tube dysfunction: Obstructive versus patulous</strong> – ET dysfunction represents a spectrum of disease ranging from obstructive dysfunction (failure of ET opening to provide adequate ventilation to the middle ear) to the opposite extreme, patulous dysfunction (failure of the ET to close).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Obstructive dysfunction is responsible for a large proportion of otitis media and chronic ear disease and is more common than patulous dysfunction. However, patulous dysfunction is more common than previously realized and can cause bothersome symptoms that may be mistaken for obstructive dysfunction, but generally does not lead to any significant acute or chronic ear disease. The underlying pathophysiology may lead to either obstructive or patulous pathology and patients may move back and forth on this spectrum, creating difficulties in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. (See <a class="local">'Spectrum of Eustachian tube dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical evaluation and diagnosis</strong> – ET dysfunction is a generally a clinical diagnosis, which can be further evaluated and confirmed with nasal endoscopy and audiology studies. When available, additional testing modalities such as tympanometry, sonotubometry, and tubomanometry may aid diagnosing ET dysfunction, although there is no gold standard diagnostic test. (See <a class="local">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – Obstructive dysfunction should be differentiated from patulous dysfunction during the evaluation; treatments for obstructive dysfunction used in patients with patulous dysfunction will not improve symptoms and may potentially exacerbate them. Medical treatment for "nonspecific" ET dysfunction (ie, ET dysfunction without an identified underlying etiology) is not effective.

(See <a class="local">'If the cause of obstructive dysfunction is unknown'</a> above and <a class="local">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">For patients with obstructive ET dysfunction of unknown etiology, we suggest intermittent ET insufflation rather than other interventions (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). When performed on a regular basis, this be effective in improving symptoms of obstructive ET dysfunction and aid in relieving retraction of the TM or middle ear effusion.

Treatment should be directed at the underlying cause (allergies, LPR, temporomandibular disorders [TMD], anxiety, neuromuscular disorders); appropriate therapy can improve tube function and reduce or eliminate symptoms.
