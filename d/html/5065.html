Maintenance fluid therapy and management of hypovolemia in older infants and children are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6122.html" rel="external">"Maintenance intravenous fluid therapy in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6103.html" rel="external">"Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p>Neonatal acute kidney injury is also discussed separately.

The use of BW to determine the degree of prematurity may be misleading when the infant is either small or large for GA. As a result, GA has become the standard used to indicate the degree of prematurity, as it is more reflective of organ maturation, including kidney function. </p><p>The classification based upon GA is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Late preterm birth – GA between 34 and less than 37 weeks</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate preterm birth – GA between 32 and &lt;34 weeks</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Very preterm (VPT) birth – GA between 28 and 31 6/7 weeks</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extremely preterm (EPT) birth – GA less than 28 weeks</p><p></p><p>Preterm infants are also classified by BW:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low birth weight (LBW) – BW less than 2500 g</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Very low birth weight (VLBW) – BW less than 1500 g</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) – BW less than 1000 g</p><p></p><p>BW by percentile for the appropriate GA have been established (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81379" href="/d/graphic/81379.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The above definitions are used throughout this review.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1024902783"><span class="h1">WATER AND ELECTROLYTE HOMEOSTASIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Water and electrolyte balance in a healthy individual is primarily dependent on kidney function and fluid intake versus losses. However, a newborn is more susceptible to derangements in water and electrolyte homeostasis because of the normal postnatal changes in body water components, functional immaturity of the neonatal kidney, increased insensible water losses compared with older individuals, and an inability to independently access water. In particular, the magnitude of postnatal diuresis, immaturity of kidney function, and insensible fluid loss is higher at lower gestational age (GA). Thus, it is important for the clinician caring for the neonate, especially very preterm (VPT) infants, to have an understanding of the basic physiologic mechanisms that regulate and maintain water and electrolyte balance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115961794"><span class="h2">Changes in total body water</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Total body water (TBW) is composed of extracellular fluid (ECF), which includes intravascular and interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. The amount of TBW as a percentage of body weight and its distribution in various fluid compartments increase with decreasing GA [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In newborn term infant, the TBW is 75 percent of the body weight as compared with 80 to 90 percent in an infant born &lt;27 weeks gestation; the ECF volumes are 45 and 70 percent, respectively. </p><p>After birth, there is a physiologic diuresis of ECF resulting in a weight loss during the first week of life. Fluid loss results primarily from an isotonic reduction in extracellular water, although the mechanism for this process is uncertain. The magnitude of diuresis and relative weight loss decreases with increasing GA. Normal weight loss varies between infants and may be as much as approximately 10 to 15 percent of birth weight in preterm and 4 to 7 percent of birth weight for term breastfed infants in the first day of life [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The postnatal diuresis is approximately 1 to 3 mL/kg per hour in term infants and is greater in preterm infants. Since fluid administration among ill or preterm infants is entirely regulated by caregivers, recognition of the normal physiologic fluid loss is a major determinant for fluid management. In addition, other concomitant fluid losses vary depending on the clinical setting. (See <a class="local">'Sources of water loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Prospective studies involving very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW ≤1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW ≤1000 g) demonstrated a consistent pattern of fluid and sodium balance despite varying intakes of sodium and water over the first five to seven days of life [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Results demonstrated that in preterm neonates there were three consistent phases of water and sodium changes based on day of life. In these studies, day 0 is the date of birth, and it will be of variable length depending on the hour of birth. Day 1 begins at 0001 on the calendar day that follows the birth date, and subsequent days follow accordingly. However, there is natural variation in the actual time that an individual infant moves between phases. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pre-diuretic phase</strong> – Birth through day 1 of life is characterized by oliguria.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diuretic and natriuretic phase</strong> – Days 2 to 3 of life are characterized by increases in both urine output and sodium losses. In this second phase, lung fluid is thought to be absorbed, resulting in increased extracellular volume. This leads to an increase in urine output.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Post-diuretic phase</strong> – Days 4 to 5 are characterized by varied urine output dependent upon changes in fluid intake compared with days 2 to 3. </p><p></p><p>As a result, monitoring of intake and output and body weight is important to ensure adequate fluid intake to maintain fluid balance. For the term infant, prior to discharge, parents are counseled on assessing intake and urinary output, and a follow-up appointment is scheduled within 48 to 72 hours after discharge to monitor weight loss and fluid intake. (See <a class="local">'Intake and output'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding", section on 'Assessment of intake'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5068.html" rel="external">"Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant", section on 'Follow-up visit'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3067593569"><span class="h2">Kidney function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neonatal kidney function is varied due to the following factors (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4989.html" rel="external">"Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Normal neonatal kidney function'</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Developmental immaturity – Kidney function improves with increasing GA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postnatal hemodynamic changes at birth that affect kidney function. The magnitude and rate of changes vary with GA.</p><p></p><p>Developmental immaturity, especially in the preterm infant, affects the following kidney functions, which can result in water and electrolyte imbalance:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Glomerular filtration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to concentrate urine</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tubular reabsorption of sodium and bicarbonate and secretion of potassium and hydrogen</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H430088980"><span class="h3">Urinary concentration and other tubular functions</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urinary concentration</strong> – Urine concentrating ability is limited in the newborn compared with older infants and children. The maximum urine concentration that can be achieved increases from 400 mosmol/kg in the first few days after birth to 1200 mosmol/kg at one year of age. As a result, the risk of volume depletion is increased in the newborn because of the inability to maximally concentrate urine and due to increased insensible fluid loss compared with older individuals. If fluid repletion is inadequate, this results in hypovolemia and hypernatremia. (See <a class="local">'Sources of water loss'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Limited concentrating ability in newborn infants is due to the following [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Limited the medullary osmotic gradient – This is due in part to the short loop of Henle in newborns that restricts the countercurrent multiplication that forms the osmotic gradient from the corticomedullary junction to the inner medulla. In addition, tonicity within the medullary interstitium is limited by reduced availability of osmolar molecules (eg, urea) due to a low dietary intake of sodium and protein from human milk and formula and reduced urea synthesis due to the typical anabolic state of the newborn.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diminished response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also referred to as arginine vasopressin) – ADH increases the water permeability of the collecting tubule by activation of its receptors. In the newborn, the collecting tubule is relatively unresponsive to changes in ADH, and the response diminishes with decreasing GA [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Concentrating ability matures after birth, but the pace of this maturation is lower in infants of lower GA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sodium</strong> – In the neonate, maximum reabsorption of sodium is limited due to tubular immaturity and tubuloglomerular imbalance, which improves with increasing GA. Limited sodium reabsorption is in part due to reduced responsiveness to aldosterone [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. Sodium transport throughout the kidney also depends on the Na-K-ATPase pump located on the basolateral membrane of various sections of the tubule and membrane transporters. In the neonate, especially VPT infants (GA &lt;32 weeks), the immature developmental expression and function of the Na-K-ATPase pump and membrane transporters result in decreased sodium reabsorption [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. As a result, the fraction of the filtered sodium that is excreted (FENa) is as high as 5 percent in preterm infants less than 30 weeks gestation, compared with less than 2 percent in older infants and children. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bicarbonate</strong> – Bicarbonate resorption in the proximal tubule is reduced due to decreased expression and activity of the NA-K-ATPase pump and carbonic anhydrase and sodium-hydrogen antiporter. This leads to a lower resorptive threshold for bicarbonate of 19 to 21 mmol/L in term infants and 16 to 20 mmol/L in preterm infants, which in turn leads to a lower serum bicarbonate level [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Potassium</strong> – Potassium excretion primarily occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, with only approximately 10 to 15 percent excreted in the urine. In the neonate, this excretion is dependent largely on the NA-K-ATPase pump. Low renal excretion is due to the decreased expression and activity of this pump, decreased responsiveness of the neonatal kidney to aldosterone, and lower GFR. This leads to higher normal values of potassium (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501" href="/d/graphic/86501.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and an increased risk of hyperkalemia, especially in ill preterm infants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14274.html" rel="external">"Causes, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of hyperkalemia in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H156739825"><span class="h3">Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Embryogenesis is complete by approximately 35 weeks gestation, at which time there are between 0.6 and 1.2 million nephrons in each kidney. As a result, GFR in preterm infants with GAs below 35 weeks is lower. So, for example, a full term infant has a GFR of approximately 26 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, whereas a preterm infant at 27 weeks gestation will have a GFR of 13.4 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4989.html" rel="external">"Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Normal neonatal kidney function'</a>.)</p><p>GFR increases at birth in all infants due to recruitment of superficial nephrons and a substantial increase in kidney blood flow (RBF) due to a decrease in renal vascular resistance and increases in systemic blood pressure. However, the velocity of change is greater in term infants compared with preterm infants, especially VPT infants. So for term infants, GFR doubles by two weeks of age to 54 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> compared with a GFR of 16.2 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>for a neonate born at 27 weeks gestation. </p><p>Lower GFR may result in higher potassium levels and sodium and water retention. </p><p>GFR is measured clinically by serum creatinine (SCr) values. Similar to GFR, SCr normally varies with GA and postnatal age. At birth, SCr concentration is the same as the concentration in the mother (usually less than 1 mg/dL [88 micromol/L]), and normally falls over time. For term infants, the decline is rapid to nadir values (SCr 0.2 to 0.4 mg/dL [18 to 35 micromol/L]) by the first or second week of life. For preterm newborns, the decline is slower, and may take up to two months to reach normal baseline (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111831" href="/d/graphic/111831.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).The diagnosis of either acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is suspected with an abnormally elevated SCr for GA and postnatal age or increasing SCr from a previous baseline. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4989.html" rel="external">"Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Serum creatinine'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4989.html" rel="external">"Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6115.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease in children: Definition, epidemiology, etiology, and course", section on 'Children less than two years of age'</a>.)</p><p>In preterm infants, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is not a reliable marker for kidney function or protein intolerance, especially for infants who receive parenteral amino acid [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Sources of water loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Water loss is divided into insensible losses through the skin and lungs, and sensible losses through the kidney (urine output). The absolute and relative amounts of water loss through these routes change with GA. Other fluid losses may include stool and gastric, ileostomy, or thoracostomy drainage.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Kidney</strong> – After birth, most neonates demonstrate low urinary volume &lt;1 mL/kg per hour) in the first day of life [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. After 24 hours of life, urine output (sensible losses) increases and is approximately 45 mL/kg per day, or 2 mL/kg per hour. As noted above, neonates have a limited ability to concentrate their urine. (See <a class="local">'Urinary concentration and other tubular functions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Skin</strong> – Evaporation through the skin can result in large insensible water losses in newborns. These may be excessive in extremely low birth weight (ELBW; BW &lt;1000 g) or extremely preterm (EPT, GA &lt;28 weeks) infants with very thin skin (increased skin permeability). In addition, the surface area-to-volume (related to body weight) ratio increases with deceasing GA, which also increases fluid loss.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As the skin matures with increasing GA and postnatal age, the surface area-to-volume ratio decreases and evaporative loss is reduced. These factors are less significant for infants born after 28 weeks GA. For EPT infants, these losses become less important one week after birth. As an example, insensible water loss in an infant born at 24 weeks gestation may be as high as 200 mL/kg per day compared with a loss of 20 mL/kg per day for a term infant. Water loss also may be excessive in conditions in which skin integrity is compromised (eg, epidermolysis bullosa, abdominal wall defect) [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other factors that may increase skin losses include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Radiant warmers, which increase evaporative water loss by approximately 50 percent [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Use of humidification and plastic wrap may minimize this loss [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Newer incubators that provide humidification and easier access to infants have been developed, resulting in a decreased use of radiant warmers [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Heat-emitting phototherapy devices, which increase transepidermal water loss [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. However, these devices are rapidly being replaced by newer ones using high-intensity gallium nitride light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy, which have no effect on transepidermal water loss [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory</strong> – With the typical ambient humidity in the nursery, approximately one-half of insensible losses in term infants are caused by water loss through the respiratory system [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Respiratory loss increases with increasing respiratory rate and decreases for infants who receive warmed humidified air, including those who are intubated and mechanically ventilated. Although respiratory water loss increases with decreasing GA, transepidermal loss increases even more [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Thus, in preterm infants, skin water loss is greater than respiratory loss. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Effect of antenatal glucocorticoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antenatal administration of glucocorticoids to promote lung maturation in preterm infants also results in maturation of the skin and kidneys (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6796.html" rel="external">"Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery"</a>). </p><p>In one report, water and sodium homeostasis during the first week after birth were compared in ELBW infants exposed and not exposed to antenatal glucocorticoids [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Exposed infants had lower insensible water loss, less hypernatremia, and an earlier diuresis and natriuresis than unexposed infants. These changes were thought to result from enhanced epithelial cell maturation that improved the barrier function of the skin. In experimental studies, glucocorticoid exposure resulted in maturation of ion channels in the proximal renal tubular epithelium [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].</p><p>In another report, exposure to antenatal glucocorticoids prevented nonoliguric hyperkalemia that frequently occurs in ELBW infants [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

Monitoring and consideration of the various concomitant and changing factors are essential to correcting and maintaining optimal balance of fluid and electrolytes in newborns. The monitoring tools used to evaluate the neonate's fluid and electrolyte status are serial physical examinations including measurements of body weight, monitoring intake and output, and frequent serial assessments of serum sodium. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical examination begins with a general assessment of the patient, including determining GA and postnatal age. These factors affect the degree of water loss (especially skin loss) (see <a class="local">'Sources of water loss'</a> above). Other factors that will influence fluid losses and need to be considered include loss of skin integrity and the use of humidified air or radiant heater. As care proceeds, serial examination should include daily weights, signs of cardiovascular stability (heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill), state of hydration (skin turgor, mucus membrane status, fullness of the anterior fontanelle), and the presence or absence of edema. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1780984960"><span class="h3">Body weight</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Body weight should be measured at least daily and in some cases more frequently. There is an expected physiologic weight loss in the first several days of life of 5 to 10 percent in term infants [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and as high as 15 percent in preterm infants [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Nomograms illustrating the normal range of weight loss over the first several days have been developed for healthy term infants based on the route of delivery [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Where clinical concern exists, it may be helpful to consult these nomograms directly. However, similar data are not available for preterm infants or ill term infants. </p><p>With appropriate nutrition and fluid intake, weight typically reaches a nadir at approximately three to four days and rebounds to near birth weight (BW) by seven days, although a significant percentage of otherwise normal infants may not regain BW for 14 days or longer. The absence of this normal weight loss or weight gain over the first few days suggests excess fluid intake or abnormally low losses. When calculating fluid intake, it makes practical sense to employ a standard convention that avoids limiting fluids during the period of normal expected postnatal weight loss. Many neonatal care units use the BW for the first seven days, while others continue to use BW until the measured weight exceeds that value. </p><p>However, it is important to note that body weight measurements in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) may be unreliable, or subject to technical errors or estimates of the added weight of items such as intravenous boards or other small equipment. Built-in electronic scales in modern beds minimize these errors, but clinicians should be vigilant about accepting measured weights that vary excessively from the accepted pattern. </p><p>When weight measurements are available, changes are obviously dependent on adequate nutrition as well as hydration status. Body weight changes often in conjunction with serum sodium concentration are the best measure of fluid status.

Fluid and electrolyte therapy must account for these factors when determining maintenance requirements and correction of any abnormalities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After birth, there is a physiologic diuresis of extracellular fluid (ECF) resulting in a weight loss during the first week of life. The magnitude of diuresis and relative weight loss increases with decreasing gestational age (GA). Normal weight loss is approximately 5 percent for term infants and is approximately 10 to 15 percent in preterm infants. (See <a class="local">'Changes in total body water'</a> above and <a class="local">'Body weight'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Kidney function is affected by both GA and postnatal age. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is low in neonates and decreases with lower GA. Although GFR increases in all infants after delivery, the rate of rise decreases with lower GA. (See <a class="local">'Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tubular function is immature in the neonate, resulting in limited ability to concentrate urine, reduced sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption (leading to increased kidney losses), and low kidney potassium excretion. (See <a class="local">'Urinary concentration and other tubular functions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The neonate has a proportionally greater insensible fluid loss compared with older individuals. This is primarily due to increased evaporative losses through the skin, which increase with decreasing GA and with the use of radiant heaters. (See <a class="local">'Sources of water loss'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitoring to maintain the correct balance of fluid and electrolytes in the neonate consists of the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Physical examination to assess the infant's GA and other factors that contribute to fluid loss (eg, loss of skin integrity). Sequential physical examinations to assess fluid status that include evaluation of cardiovascular stability, daily weights, and the presence of edema. Normal weight loss over the first three to five days should be expected. Volume overload is suggested by inadequate weight loss in this time period or excessive weight gain, edema, and increased blood pressure. Inadequate fluid administration may be accompanied by excessive weight loss, tachycardia, poor capillary refill, and, in severe cases, hypotension. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Monitoring fluid intake and output of urine and stool. (See <a class="local">'Intake and output'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For infants receiving parenteral fluids, serial measurement of serum sodium. During the first days of life, changes in sodium concentration primarily reflect changes in water intake with hyponatremia associated with excess water (hypervolemia) and hypernatremia with excessive water loss (hypovolemia). The frequency of monitoring is dependent on the infant's clinical condition and GA. (See <a class="local">'Serum sodium'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Calculation of fluid and electrolyte requirements must account for correction of fluid abnormalities (deficit or excess water) and ongoing maintenance requirements. Maintenance fluid requirements are those needed for neutral water balance after accounting for obligatory losses (eg, urine and stool) and insensible losses (eg, skin and lungs) (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80805" href="/d/graphic/80805.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) and are influenced by postnatal age and birth weight (BW), environmental factors, kidney function, and ventilator dependence. (See <a class="local">'Fluid and electrolyte management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintenance requirements for sodium, potassium, and chloride are approximately 2 to 3 mEq/kg per day. For infants receiving intravenous fluids, these electrolytes are not given during the first 48 hours after birth. Additional electrolyte losses beyond maintenance requirements should be replaced. (See <a class="local">'Initial prescription'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the newborn, particularly preterm infants, electrolyte disorders are common and include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hyponatremia (see <a class="local">'Hyponatremia'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypernatremia (see <a class="local">'Hypernatremia'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypokalemia (see <a class="local">'Hypokalemia'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hyperkalemia (see <a class="local">'Hyperkalemia'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H275993503"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Jochen Profit, MD, MPH, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Young A, Brown LK, Ennis S, et al.
