         Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is a rare small vessel vasculitis that affects glomerular capillaries, pulmonary capillaries, or both. Most patients present with rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis, although some patients may present with relatively mild kidney impairment. In general, this disorder is typically associated with severe kidney injury that, if untreated, progresses quickly to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment and prognosis of anti-GBM disease are discussed in this review. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed elsewhere. (See

         <strong>
          Early

         diagnosis and intervention are key determinants of the response to therapy and long-term prognosis of patients with anti-GBM disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. There is a direct correlation between the initial plasma creatinine concentration and the percent of glomeruli with crescents; in particular, crescents are usually present in more than 75 percent of glomeruli when the plasma creatinine concentration is above 5 mg/dL (442 micromol/L). In addition, there is a direct correlation between anti-GBM antibody levels and the plasma creatinine at presentation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Avoidance of maintenance dialysis is uncommon in patients who require dialysis within 72 hours of presentation, particularly in those who have crescents involving all glomeruli [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. By comparison, prevention of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) can usually be achieved in less severe cases, although some do progress. A low proportion of preserved glomeruli and the presence of oligoanuria may be the best determinants of poor prognosis for recovery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A common clinical question is whether to start empiric therapy in patients with suspected anti-GBM disease before the diagnosis has been confirmed by serologic testing or kidney biopsy. We do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         delay therapy in these patients and initiate therapy within 24 hours of a presumptive diagnosis. The results of diagnostic testing may take several days to become available, and delaying treatment may increase the patient's risk of developing irreversible kidney damage.

         Whether to treat patients who present with dialysis-dependent kidney failure without pulmonary hemorrhage is a more challenging decision. Some experts do not treat these patients, since there is a very low likelihood of kidney response, especially if the patient has 100 percent crescents on kidney biopsy [

         ]. As an example, findings such as a purpuric rash and arthralgias are suggestive of a concurrent vasculitis since they are uncommon in anti-GBM disease alone. (See

         Our rationale to treat all patients with kidney involvement who do not require immediate dialysis is based upon observational evidence that immunosuppressive therapy may also benefit patients who present with high plasma creatinine concentrations. In a retrospective analysis of 71 patients with anti-GBM disease who were treated with plasma exchange,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9808" href="/z/d/drug information/9808.html" rel="external">

         , patient and kidney survival varied with the severity at presentation:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         For patients who presented with a plasma creatinine concentration of less than 5.7 mg/dL (500 micromol/L), patient and kidney survival were 100 and 95 percent at one year and 84 and 74 percent at last follow-up (median period of 90 months), respectively.

         </span>
         For patients who presented with a plasma creatinine concentration greater than 5.7 mg/dL (500 micromol/L), but who did not require immediate dialysis (within 72 hours of presentation), patient and kidney survival were 83 and 82 percent at one year and 72 and 69 percent at last follow-up, respectively.

         For patients who required immediate dialysis, patient and kidney survival were 65 and 8 percent at one year and 36 and 5 percent at last follow-up, respectively. All such patients who had crescents in all glomeruli on kidney biopsy required long-term maintenance dialysis. By comparison, two patients with significant acute tubular necrosis plus crescents on biopsy eventually recovered long-term independent kidney function.

         Once a decision is made to treat (see
         <a class="local">
          'Whom to treat'
         </a>
         above), we recommend treatment with plasmapheresis combined with immunosuppressive therapy, rather than immunosuppressive therapy alone. Plasmapheresis removes circulating anti-GBM antibodies and other mediators of inflammation, and the immunosuppressive agents minimize new antibody formation. In most cases, we advocate for inpatient admission to initiate therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no large, randomized trials to support this approach, and most studies have been uncontrolled. In general, the available data suggest that approximately 30 to 45 percent of patients treated with plasmapheresis combined with immunosuppression will benefit by not progressing to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,10-13
         </a>
         ]. However, recovery is much more likely in patients who begin treatment before oligoanuria ensues and is uncommon in patients who require dialysis or who have 100 percent crescents on biopsy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Whom to treat'
         </a>
         above.)

        <p>
         The only available randomized trial evaluated outcomes among 17 patients who were treated with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone

          cyclophosphamide
         </a>
         with or without plasmapheresis [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. At the end of treatment, two of eight patients in the plasmapheresis group, compared with six of nine in the immunosuppression-alone group, became dialysis dependent (25 versus 67 percent, respectively). The authors concluded that, although there may have been some benefit from plasmapheresis, the percent of crescents on initial kidney biopsy and entry plasma creatinine correlated better with outcome. Regardless of therapy, patients with less than 30 percent crescents and a plasma creatinine below 3 mg/dL (265 micromol/L) did well, while those with severe crescentic involvement and a plasma creatinine above 4 mg/dL (354 micromol/L) did poorly. In observational studies, the use of plasmapheresis has been associated with improved patient and kidney survival [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16

        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the absence of definitive evidence of benefit, plasmapheresis is generally recommended for the treatment of patients with anti-GBM disease. Two factors are considered by many experts to justify this recommendation:

         Our preferred initial plasmapheresis prescription is daily 4 liter exchanges for two to three weeks [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3,17
         </a>
         ]. However, alternate day plasmapheresis has been used by some, especially after the initial two weeks of treatment. Plasmapheresis using either centrifugal or membrane separation methods is considered to be equally efficacious [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In general, albumin is given as the replacement fluid. If, however, the patient has had a recent kidney biopsy or has pulmonary hemorrhage, then one to two liters of fresh frozen plasma should be substituted for albumin at the end of the procedure to replete coagulation factors that may have been depleted by plasmapheresis [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         At the end of this two- to three-week regimen, the need for further plasmapheresis is determined by the patient's clinical status and serum anti-GBM antibody titers (see
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring the response to therapy'
         </a>
         below). Further plasmapheresis may be unnecessary if the patient has improved and serum anti-GBM antibody titers have markedly declined and are undetectable or nearly undetectable. By comparison, continued plasmapheresis may be required if the patient still has active pulmonary disease (eg, hemoptysis), if antibody titers are not declining substantially, or if antibody titers rebound after stopping plasmapheresis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A potential complication with fresh frozen plasma (14 percent citrate by volume) is the development of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolism of the administered citrate generates bicarbonate, the excretion of which may be limited by kidney failure. Citrate-induced metabolic alkalosis can be corrected by hemodialysis if needed.

         Most patients with anti-GBM disease who experience remission do not require maintenance immunosuppressive therapy given the low rate of recurrent disease. An exception to this is the patient who is double-positive for anti-GBM antibodies and ANCA. Such patients have a higher risk of relapse of vasculitis and should receive maintenance therapy similar to that used for ANCA-associated vasculitis. (See

         – During the acute phase of the disease (first two to three weeks), when most patients are admitted to the hospital for treatment, we monitor the serum creatinine level, a complete blood count, and urine output daily. If the patient has pulmonary hemorrhage, serial chest radiographs are reasonable to monitor for worsening alveolar hemorrhage. When the patient's condition is stable enough for discharge from the hospital, we typically schedule follow-up visits weekly for the first two to four weeks. In patients who continue to remain stable, the duration between follow-up visits can then be extended to every two to four weeks.

         Patients who are double positive for anti-GBM antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) should be managed initially as for anti-GBM disease since that is the more severe lesion. However, unlike patients with single-positive anti-GBM disease, double-positive patients will require maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for ANCA disease because of the tendency of vasculitis to relapse [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         ]. Because of reports that double-positive patients may be more likely to recover from dialysis than single-positive anti-GBM disease, treatment with plasmapheresis plus immunosuppressive therapy should be considered for those presenting with dialysis-requiring kidney failure [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

        <p>
         Observational studies have shown that double-positive patients have similar outcomes to those with single-positive anti-GBM disease but experience higher rates of relapse because they have ANCA-associated vasculitis [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,34
         </a>
         ]. As an example, one study that included 41 patients with single-positive anti-GBM disease and 37 double-positive patients reported 12-month kidney survival rates of 44 and 53 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Kidney recovery at one year was greater among double-positive patients than among those with anti-GBM disease (29 versus 17 percent). However, while no single-positive anti-GBM disease patients experienced disease relapse, approximately one-half of double-positive patients had recurrent disease over a median of 4.8 years, suggesting that maintenance immunosuppressive therapy may be beneficial in these patients, as in those with ANCA-associated vasculitis.

          Importance of early intervention
         </strong>
         – If left untreated, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease usually progresses rapidly to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for achieving the best response to therapy since the percent of crescents on initial kidney biopsy and the pretherapy plasma creatinine concentration correlate best with outcome. Recovery of kidney function is rare if dialysis is required at initiation of treatment. (See

This includes all patients with pulmonary hemorrhage (hemoptysis), independent of the presence and/or severity of kidney involvement, and all patients with kidney involvement who do not require immediate dialysis. In selected patients who require immediate dialysis and do not have pulmonary hemorrhage, such as those with very acute disease, those with biopsies showing focal crescents and tubular damage, or those with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and clinical signs of systemic vasculitis, a trial of therapy can be considered.

          Plasmapheresis

         – We perform daily 4 liter exchanges for two to three weeks. In general, albumin is given as the replacement fluid. If, however, the patient has had a recent kidney biopsy or has pulmonary hemorrhage, then one to two liters of fresh frozen plasma should be substituted for albumin at the end of the procedure to replete coagulation factors that may have been depleted by plasmapheresis.

         (1 mg/kg per day to a maximum of 60 to 80 mg/day), which can be tapered once remission is induced. Some clinicians choose to administer oral prednisone without an IV pulse. The initial cyclophosphamide dose is 2 mg/kg per day orally. We typically reduce the dose by 25 percent in older adults (age &gt;60 years) and frail patients and adjust the dose appropriately for impaired kidney function (

          Supportive measures

         – In addition to plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive therapy, patients with severe disease may require organ supportive care. Patients presenting with life-threatening hemoptysis, for example, may require intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as measures to control the bleeding. (See

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – Anti-GBM antibody levels should be monitored weekly for the first six weeks until they are undetectable on two consecutive occasions. We subsequently monitor anti-GBM antibody levels every other week for four weeks, and if they remain persistently undetectable, we monitor levels once monthly for six months. In addition, we check antibody levels if the patient experiences clinical signs suggestive of recurrence (see

          Recurrent disease
         </strong>
         – Relapses are uncommon. In cases of recurrence with kidney involvement, we repeat a kidney biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and exclude concomitant pathologies such as ANCA-associated vasculitis and membranous nephropathy. In confirmed cases of recurrent anti-GBM disease, we retreat with plasmapheresis combined with glucocorticoids and
