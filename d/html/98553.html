For these women, alternative pathways to parenthood have included adoption or foster parenting and, in countries where available, use of a gestational carrier. However, gestational carrier pregnancy has limited availability worldwide and, for some women, the desire to carry and birth a child make the option of uterus transplantation appealing. This topic will discuss the ethics, indications, and patient selection for uterus transplantation, an experimental approach to restoring fertility in women with AUFI. The purpose of this topic is to provide information on this developing technology for clinicians and patients; the topic is not intended to be used for treatment decisions.</p><p>Specific discussion of the procedures for uterus transplantation and general issues related to organ transplantation can be found in the following topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110868.html" rel="external">"Uterus transplantation for absolute uterine factor infertility: Surgery, immunosuppression, and obstetric management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7346.html" rel="external">"Transplantation immunobiology"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3542.html" rel="external">"Prevention of graft-versus-host disease", section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender diverse individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3112229210"><span class="h1">PROCEDURE OVERVIEW AND HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Uterus transplantation is an experimental procedure to treat AUFI. Once the intended uterus recipient and organ donor have been identified, the process begins with in vitro fertilization (IVF) to create and freeze embryos for the intended recipient [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Next, the organ donor undergoes a radical-type hysterectomy followed by transplantation of the donor organ into the recipient. After at least 6 to 10 months of immunosuppressive treatment, the recipient undergoes embryo transfer, pregnancy, and, if the pregnancy is successful, delivery via cesarean delivery. At the conclusion of childbearing, the transplanted organ is removed to avoid the need for lifelong immunosuppression.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Procedure history</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>First procedure</strong> – The first human uterus transplantation was performed in 2000 in Saudi Arabia, with a uterus from a living donor, and reported to the public in 2002 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This attempt resulted in uterus removal three months after transplantation because of necrosis. Necrosis may have been related to the surgical preparation of the donor uterus; the short pedicles of the uterine arteries and veins were elongated with saphenous vein grafts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Second procedure</strong> – The second human uterus transplantation was performed in September 2011 in Turkey [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A 21-year-old women with uterine agenesis received a uterus from a 23-year-old deceased woman. During the organ harvesting surgery, the uterus was prioritized as the first organ to be flushed and removed, with the goal of minimizing damage from warm ischemic time. Embryo transfers started 18 months after transplantation and during the initial period the patient conceived at least two pregnancies, but both ended in early miscarriage [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Ultimately, the patient delivered a healthy infant nine years after transplant [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Prior to this birth, the patient underwent 12 embryo transfers, experienced five pregnancy losses, was diagnosed with partially obstructed blood flow, and underwent a saphenous graft between the utero-ovarian vein of the graft and the left ovarian vein to resolve of venous congestion. The pregnancy was complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes at 19 weeks gestation and a live-born infant was delivered at 28 weeks. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Subsequent procedures</strong> – Since the initial reports, uterus transplantation has been successfully performed in Sweden, the United States, Brazil, Serbia, India, Czech Republic, China, Lebanon, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. In a review of 33 US uterus transplant recipients, the one-year graft survival rate was 74 percent (23 of 31) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Birth history</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>First live birth</strong> – In 2014, the world's first live birth occurred, from a uterus transplanted by the Swedish team (transplant performed in 2013) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The 35-year-old recipient had congenital absence of the uterus (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) and received a uterus from a living, 61-year-old woman who had previously had two live births. The donor had been postmenopausal for seven years prior to donor hysterectomy. Prior to the transplantation, the patient and her male partner underwent IVF to create embryos and also to confirm that conception was possible for the recipient. Approximately one year after the uterus transplantation, the patient then underwent transfer of one previously frozen embryo. The patient developed preeclampsia and a male infant was subsequently born at 31 weeks and 6 days of gestation via cesarean delivery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Subsequent live births</strong> – Additional live births from uteri transplanted by the Swedish team have since occurred, including a birth for a woman who received a uterus from her own mother [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The first birth from a transplanted uterus in the United States occurred in November 2017 [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In December 2018, a team in Brazil reported the first live birth following a deceased-donor uterus transplant performed in a woman with congenital absence of the uterus [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The uterus came from a 45-year-old parous three donor who had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and was declared brain dead. In the US, a deceased-donor pregnancy and subsequent birth was achieved despite the patient being initially treated for grade 3 rejection [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2234035391"><span class="h1">ABSOLUTE UTERINE FACTOR INFERTILITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H838267979"><span class="h2">Definition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AUFI refers to infertility that is completely attributable to the uterus because of absence (congenital or surgical) or abnormalities (anatomic or functional) that prevent embryo implantation or completion of a pregnancy to term. AUFI is the primary indication for uterus transplantation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3370090664"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is estimated that 1 in 500 women of childbearing age are affected by AUFI, defined as an absent or non-functional uterus [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Models predict there are over 12,000 affected women in the United Kingdom and 150,000 women in Europe [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. While the prevalence of uterine factor infertility can be estimated, the percentage of such women who would desire uterus transplantation to carry a pregnancy is not known.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4009535648"><span class="h2">Absent uterus</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uterine agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome</strong> – MRKH syndrome is the congenital absence of a uterus or the presence of a rudimentary solid bipartite uterus in combination with absence of the vagina above the hymenal plane. MRKH syndrome accounts for less than 3 percent of all müllerian malformations and has an estimated prevalence of 1:4500 females [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Females with MRKH syndrome have a normal karyotype, and they can have normal offspring without urogenital malformations when they pursue gestational carrier pregnancy using their own eggs [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. A study from a United States transplant center reported that, of the 92 percent of recipient candidates who had an anatomical lack of the uterus (from any cause, including hysterectomy), 36 percent had a congenital malformation [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5418.html" rel="external">"Congenital uterine anomalies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Women with the typical (ie, type A or women with two kidneys) MRKH syndrome are ideal candidates for uterus transplant, but some programs accept women with a single kidney. Patients with a single kidney may have a higher risk of having obstetric complications such as severe preeclampsia [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In the Swedish series, all women who developed preeclampsia had a single kidney, but one of these women with a single kidney did not develop preeclampsia in her second pregnancy, which resulted in a live birth.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hysterectomy</strong> – Hysterectomy during the reproductive period is the most common cause of acquired AUFI. Approximately 600,000 procedures are performed annually in the United States alone, with more than 40 percent of the surgeries occurring in women under 44 years of age [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In one clinical trial in the United States that initially screened 239 women for uterus transplantation, 64 percent had undergone hysterectomy while 32 percent presented with congenital anomalies [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Of the women with prior hysterectomy, 50 percent were performed for benign indications, 25 percent for malignancy, and 25 percent for obstetric complications. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Discussion of these common indications for hysterectomy are presented in detail separately:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3246.html" rel="external">"Management of early-stage cervical cancer", section on 'Type of surgery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16917.html" rel="external">"Overview of resectable endometrial carcinoma", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5395.html" rel="external">"Peripartum hysterectomy for management of hemorrhage"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5478.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Treatment overview", section on 'Traditional surgery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transgender women</strong> – The role and feasibility of uterus transplantation in transgender women are not yet known [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In a survey study of 182 transgender women, 99 percent reported the belief that a uterus transplant would lead to greater happiness [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Respondents reported a desire to become pregnant and give birth in the future (94 percent); that the ability to gestate and give birth would enhance perceptions of their femininity (94 percent); and that having a transplanted, functioning vagina would improve their sexual experience (90 percent), improve their quality of life (90 percent), and help them feel more like a female (92 percent). Research into the feasibility of uterus transplant into genetic males, human or animal, has not been done.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3094500010"><span class="h2">Nonfunctional uterus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with uterine factors that contribute to, but do not exclusively cause, infertility would not typically be candidates for uterus transplantation because established medical and surgical infertility treatments exist. Uterus transplantation could be considered for these women only when all other therapeutic options have failed.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Müllerian malformations</strong> – Congenital uterine malformations occur because of disturbances during fetal life in the formation, development, or fusion of the müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef134638" href="/d/graphic/134638.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef134639" href="/d/graphic/134639.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). These malformations can increase the risk of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes as well as cause infertility [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. A summary of the estimated prevalence of the most frequent müllerian malformations and their potential impact on fertility is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110955" href="/d/graphic/110955.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Further information and comprehensive reviews of uterus malformations and their management can be found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5418.html" rel="external">"Congenital uterine anomalies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3292.html" rel="external">"Congenital uterine anomalies: Surgical repair"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrauterine adhesions</strong> – Intrauterine adhesions, or intrauterine synechiae, result when scar tissue develops within the uterine cavity, typically in response to intrauterine surgery or infection. Intrauterine adhesions accompanied by symptoms (eg, infertility, amenorrhea) are also referred to as Asherman syndrome [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]. Asherman syndrome occurs in approximately 1.5 percent of reproductive-age women. Of affected women, approximately 50 percent have infertility and, for those who do conceive, approximately 40 percent miscarry [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. The main treatment is hysteroscopic adhesiolysis, which varies in efficacy from 30 to 90 percent, depending on the severity of the adhesions. Thus, approximately 30 percent of affected women are unable to conceive and could potentially be candidates for hysterectomy followed by uterus transplantation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3285.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radiation injury</strong> – Radiotherapy, given either as total body irradiation or as local irradiation of the pelvis, causes up to a 60 percent reduction in uterine volume that is irreversible [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>]. This volume reduction, and possible effects on the endometrium, contributes to an inability to conceive, increased rate of early miscarriage, and increased rate of late pregnancy loss [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Radiation therapy also causes scarring, adhesions, and impaired healing, which may make these women suboptimal candidates for uterus transplantation [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Moreover, the gonadotoxic effects of radiation on the ovaries, and the need for oocyte donation, have to be taken into consideration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4801.html" rel="external">"Overview of infertility and pregnancy outcome in cancer survivors"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Repeated unsuccessful implantation </strong>– Endometrial receptivity refers to the transient state when the uterine epithelium is suitable for blastocyst attachment and implantation [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation (WOI) is crucial for achieving pregnancy. Infertility can result when endometrial receptivity is not synchronized with the WOI. While in vitro fertilization with individually-timed embryo transfer can overcome this discrepancy in most women, approximately 25 percent of women remain infertile, mostly as a result of age and ovarian factors [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. However, those with infertility related to uterus dysfunction may be candidates for hysterectomy and uterus transplantation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myoma not requiring hysterectomy</strong> – Uterine leiomyomas (ie, fibroids) are more common in women with infertility than in the general population (27 versus 8 percent) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Submucous and intramural fibroids are associated with decreased implantation and pregnancy rates; the impact of subserosal fibroids on fertility is controversial [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. One meta-analysis of 11 studies reported a 21 percent relative reduction in live birth rate for women with non-distorting fibroids compared with women without fibroids [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. While myomectomy is the treatment of choice, women who remain infertile despite myomectomy could be treated with hysterectomy and uterus transplantation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3430596340"><span class="h1">ETHICAL ISSUES OF UTERUS TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Key ethical points in considering uterus transplantation include the non-life-saving nature of the procedure; existence of proven alternatives to family building; the experimental nature of uterus transplantation; and the risks and benefits to the donor, recipient, developing fetus, and newborn. As gestational carrier pregnancy and adoption both exist as alternative paths to parenthood for women with AUFI, even though they are not available in all regions of the world, the ethics of performing uterine transplantation are often considered in context with these two established options. However, these options differ from uterus transplantation in that adoption does not allow a genetic link between the mother and child and neither adoption nor gestational carrier pregnancy allows the women to have the emotional and physical experiences of pregnancy [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. In addition, the risks to a gestational carrier must be considered.</p><p>The original and revised Montreal Criteria initially provided a theoretical framework to guide uterus transplantation. However, the recommendations were limited because they could not address the practical issues of the still-developing surgery and patient-reported outcomes of uterus transplantation [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. Uterus transplantation is unique in that the rights of multiple parties must be considered and balanced: the living donor or the immediate family of a deceased donor, the recipient, the genetic father (if partnered with the uterus recipient), and the intended child(ren). Major ethical issues specific to uterus transplantation include [<a href="#rid41">41-43</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Life-enhancing transplant</strong> – Uterus transplantation is considered a life-enhancing, rather than life-saving, surgery, similar to transplantation of a face, limb, abdominal wall, trachea, or larynx [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Thus, rigorous scientific and ethical justification are required to conduct procedures that are designed to improve life compared with life-saving transplantation procedures. Alternative pathways to parenthood already exist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The procedure is considered investigational. Thus, informed consent for research participation is required from the living donor and recipient. As with any developing technology, there is a potential for therapeutic misconception during the informed consent process [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. For this reason, the informed consent process must be conducted by those who are familiar with clinical research.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Deceased-donor consent</strong> – Transplantation of deceased-donor organs involves the challenges of consent, procurement, and confidentiality [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Some families will consent to donation of all organs except the uterus [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. As uterus transplantation is new, the patient who consented to traditional organ transplantation may not have considered the implications of uterus transplantation [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Thus, additional steps may be needed to assist potential surrogate decision-makers in the decision to consider uterus donation for the deceased patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Multiple surgeries for recipient</strong> – The organ recipient will undergo, on average, three to four abdominal surgeries, including the transplant itself, cesarean delivery (or deliveries), and hysterectomy once childbearing is complete. Additional surgeries may be needed if complications are encountered. Significant potential complications include bleeding, infection, and venous thromboembolism. The participant must be aware of these risks prior to undertaking uterus transplantation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Temporary transplant</strong> – Uterus transplantation is the first temporary transplant procedure. The reason is that, by removing the transplanted organ after childbearing, the recipient will avoid the needs and risk of lifelong immunosuppression. However, as the organ is part of the recipient once transplantation is complete, removal requires consent of the participant. Allowances must be made for the participant who declines postpregnancy hysterectomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy and outcomes</strong> – Procedure efficacy and related outcomes are being elucidated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Swedish trial of nine uterus transplant procedures</strong> – The initial Swedish uterus transplantation trial included nine patients with AUFI [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Two patients had their grafts removed within the first six months (one-year graft survival 78 percent); six patients continued through IVF and delivered a total of nine infants (three women gave birth twice) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. The cumulative birth rates were 86 percent for surgically successful transplant recipients and 67 percent for all transplant recipients. Mean duration of gestation was 35+3 weeks (range 31+6 to 38+0 weeks) and mean deviation from birth weight by gestational age was -1 percent (range -13 to + 23 percent).

Options include regulation as an organ transplantation under the Uniform Network for Organ Sharing or as an assisted reproductive technology, potentially through a free-market system [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

Moreover, the donor and recipient have time to minimize the influence of modifiable risk factors such as smoking and excess weight. In the Swedish research protocol, five of the donors were mothers of the recipients, which improves the likelihood of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match as well as confirms a reproductively functional uterus [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].

The rationale for the first two criteria was that they did not want to transplant a structurally normal uterus that is not fully functional for reproduction. They also limited the number of cesarean deliveries in the donor to one, via transverse lower-uterine segment incision, because of the increased risk of abnormal placentation (placenta previa and accreta) and risk of uterine rupture [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

In the trial of nine uterus transplantation procedures, four donor women were premenopausal, two were postmenopausal &lt;5 years, and three were postmenopausal ≥5 years [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Postmenopausal uterus donors were treated with estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy prior to surgery to ascertain menstrual functionality of the uterus prior to transplantation and to potentially increase the uterine artery blood flow [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

The research protocol included consultation by the following services: gynecology, transplantation surgery, psychology, clinical immunology, anesthesiology, and radiology [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Unique to uterus transplantation, the recipient also undergoes a preoperative fertility evaluation and in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle to create embryos. One protocol for preoperative testing of the organ recipient, by medical specialty, is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110960" href="/d/graphic/110960.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Psychological evaluation is extensive and includes assessment of cognition, social support, mental illness, substance use, and relationship stress [<a href="#rid60">60-62</a>]. In the research trial, the uterus donor and recipient underwent similar testing, but different psychologists evaluated each woman. The organ recipient must have the mental capacity to undergo IVF, multiple surgeries, immunosuppressive treatment, and the challenges of pregnancy, all for a procedure that is not life-saving. In addition, the recipient must be prepared for the possibility that the graft could fail, she could have complications requiring graft removal (including termination of a viable pregnancy), or she could have a successful transplant but still not achieve a live birth. Despite these challenges, preliminary data suggest that patients and their partners remain psychologically stable throughout the process [<a href="#rid60">60,63</a>]. Psychological testing typically occurs as part of the evaluation for IVF and is presented below.

Previous CMV and EBV infections are, in some programs, relative contraindications, if the donor is positive but the recipient is negative. Transmission of CMV via an infected organ can cause fever, pneumonia, gastrointestinal ulceration, hepatitis, and graft dysfunction. EBV-infected B-cells may proliferate uncontrollably during T-cell immunosuppression, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) can result. PTLD can occur when the transplant recipient experiences a primary EBV infection or in reactivated infections. PTLD, itself a serious complication, can also progress to a malignant lymphoma [<a href="#rid64">64,65</a>].

Concern exists that the oviducts could sustain ischemic damage during the transplantation process, which could then increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy in the setting of spontaneous conception. Were an ectopic pregnancy to develop, it would be extremely difficult to treat laparoscopically because presence of adhesions. In addition, it is not clear that the oviducts would be functional because the ovaries are lateral to the external iliac vessels in women with uterine agenesis, and the distance between the ovaries and the fallopian tubes may be too great to allow the fimbriated ends to pick up an ovulated oocyte.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3959043391"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – Uterus transplantation is a complex, multi-step procedure for the treatment of absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI). AUFI refers to infertility that is fully attributable to the uterus because of absence (congenital or surgical) or abnormalities (anatomic or functional) that prevent embryo implantation or completion of a pregnancy to term. (See <a class="local">'Procedure overview and history'</a> above and <a class="local">'Absolute uterine factor infertility'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ethical considerations</strong> – Keys ethical points in considering uterus transplantation include the non-life-saving nature of the procedure; existence of proven alternatives for family building; the experimental nature of uterus transplantation; and the risks and benefits to the donor, recipient, and developing fetus. While gestational carrier pregnancy and adoption both exist as alternative paths to parenthood, these options are not available in all regions of the world and not congruent with all patients' values and needs with respect to family building. (See <a class="local">'Ethical issues of uterus transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comparison of living and deceased organ donors</strong> – The uterus donor may be alive or deceased. Advantages of living donors include larger potential supply of organs and ample time for preoperative testing, screening, and assembly of a multi-specialty surgical team. The main disadvantage is the extensive pelvic surgery for organ removal. Use of deceased donors avoids the donor's surgical risk and allows for a more extensive graft harvest. Disadvantages of a deceased-donor organ include the limited availability of organs, unpredictable timing of organ procurement, potential that the donor uterus has not yet produced a term pregnancy, and potential ethical uncertainties regarding consent. (See <a class="local">'Use of living or deceased donor'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inclusion criteria and testing</strong> – As human uterus transplantation is in the experimental stages, the optimal inclusion and exclusion criteria for both donors and recipients are not yet known. Living donors and recipients undergo extensive testing to ensure medical and psychological appropriateness. The authors’ protocol includes consultation by the following services: gynecology, transplantation surgery, psychology, clinical immunology, anesthesiology, and radiology. (See <a class="local">'Selection and evaluation of recipient and donor'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preoperative imaging</strong> – Prior to removal, the donor uterus is evaluated with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (if technically possible) to estimate the size of the uterus, rule out uterine pathology, exclude müllerian anomalies, and evaluate the vasculature. (See <a class="local">'Donor uterus evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of planned genetic father</strong> – The goals for the evaluation of the future genetic father are to exclude male-factor causes of infertility, exclude infectious diseases that could be transmitted to the immunosuppressed mother, and to identify relationship challenges that could negatively impact the outcome of uterus transplantation. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of genetic father'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Informed consent process</strong> – As part of the informed consent process, the uterus donor must be free from coercion; be fully informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives for both the donor and the recipient; have access to an independent donor advocate; and be informed of the early and late surgical risks. The uterus recipient must be educated to the risks and benefits of uterus transplantation and then consented for the multiple steps of the process that will ultimately result in a live-born child, including gonadotropin stimulation, egg retrieval for the creation of embryos, uterus transplantation, immunosuppression, embryo transfer, pregnancy, cesarean delivery, and uterus removal. The consent for the genetic father mainly pertains to the in vitro fertilization treatments that he must undergo to create embryos prior to uterus transplantation. (See <a class="local">'Consent'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Jones BP, Saso S, Yazbek J, Smith JR.
