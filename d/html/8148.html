         Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141103" href="/z/d/graphic/141103.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The number of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States has increased from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1987 to 17.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018. There are considerable racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related mortality [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A multidisciplinary cardio-obstetrics team, including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, a cardiologist, and an obstetrical anesthesiologist, is required to provide optimal medical care to high-risk patients. The American Heart Association has published a scientific statement entitled "Cardiovascular Considerations in Caring for Pregnant Patients" [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, rheumatic heart disease was the most common form of cardiac disease in pregnant people; it still predominates in developing countries and in immigrant populations in the United States. Congenital heart disease is now the most common form of heart disease complicating pregnancy in the United States, in part because advances in the treatment of congenital heart disease have made it possible for more affected children to reach adulthood and attempt pregnancy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1422.html" rel="external">
          "Pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease: General principles"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, many women are postponing childbearing until the fourth and fifth decades of life [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ], often made possible with IVF therapies. With advancing maternal age, underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia become more common and increase the incidence of acquired heart disease complicating pregnancy. For example, conditions associated with spontaneous coronary artery dissection during pregnancy include advanced maternal age and infertility treatments [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Arrhythmias are more frequent in pregnant people 41 to 50 years of age [

         Pregnancy is associated with several cardiocirculatory changes that can significantly impact underlying cardiac disease. These changes begin early in pregnancy (within the first five to eight weeks), reach their peak during the late second trimester, and then remain relatively constant until delivery [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Knowledge of these cardiovascular adaptations is required to correctly interpret hemodynamic and cardiovascular tests during pregnancy, labor, and delivery; to predict the effects of pregnancy on the woman with underlying cardiac disease; and to understand how the fetus will be affected by maternal cardiac disorders. There are changes in cardiac output, blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, and changes in blood volume which may have a significant impact on a pregnancy depending on the underlying cardiac disease, as discussed separately.

         Normal physical findings may include prominent distended neck veins related to the increased blood volume and compression of the IVC, basilar rales due to an elevated diaphragm, a prominent but not displaced left and right ventricular apical impulse due to the increased blood volume and cardiac output, exaggerated heart sounds, and a new systolic ejection flow murmur best heard over the mid or lower left sternal border. Preexisting murmurs will be louder. A physiologic S3 gallop may be appreciated in a young patient but would be abnormal in a 40 year old woman. Peripheral edema will be present in the last trimester due to the increased blood volume and inferior vena cava compression. One of the challenges for the clinician is how to distinguish between these normal signs of pregnancy and similar signs that may indicate underlying heart disease (eg, heart failure, previously undiagnosed valvular heart disease) in the mother. The maternal cardiac evaluation is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Women with acquired heart disease are at risk for cardiac complications during pregnancy. Their risk can be assessed by evaluating the severity of their valve lesions and the degree of ventricular dysfunction. The history, physical examination, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram form the foundation of cardiac evaluation in all patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         A commonly used risk assessment tool is CARPREG II, which is based on data from 1938 pregnancies in two large Canadian hospitals [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In the study population, 63.7 percent of patients had congenital heart disease, 22.9 percent had acquired heart disease, and 13.4 percent had isolated cardiac arrhythmias. 13.6 percent had at least mild left ventricular systolic function and 2 percent had coronary artery disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CARPREG II risk score includes 10 predictors of risk for the development of cardiac complications.

         Five are general predictors; prior cardiac events or arrhythmias (3 points), poor functional class or cyanosis (3 points), high risk valve disease or LVOT obstruction (2 points), systemic ventricular dysfunction defined as an ejection fraction less than 55 percent (2 points) and no prior cardiac intervention (1 point).

         Four are lesion specific predictors; mechanical valves (3 points), high-risk aortopathy with aortic dimension &gt;45 mm (2 points), pulmonary hypertension (2 points) and coronary artery disease (2 points).

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac complications, primarily arrhythmias and heart failure, occurred in 16 percent of the study patients. The risk of a primary cardiac event was 5 percent for 0-1 point, 10 percent for 2 points, 15 percent for 3 points, 22 percent for 4 points, and 41 percent for &gt;4 points.

         The 2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy recommended the use of the modified WHO classification for risk stratification [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>

         There is insufficient information to determine whether pregnancy might be better tolerated in some groups than in others based upon the etiology of the cardiomyopathy. A study of 26 women from Brazil suggested that cardiac complications were higher in the idiopathic group than in the group with peripartum cardiomyopathy and persistent left ventricular dysfunction [

All maternal cardiac events occurred in women with moderate or severe LV systolic dysfunction (defined as left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt;45 percent) and/or New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV and/or a prior cardiac event.

         Patients with known or suspected left ventricular dysfunction should have an echocardiogram before conception, or as soon as possible after pregnancy is confirmed, to determine baseline ventricular function.

         There is little published information about the optimal management of pregnant people with preexisting ischemic heart disease. This would include females with a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary interventions, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), coronary artery bypass surgery, and CAD from a systemic process such as vasculitis. SCAD is the most common cause of myocardial infarction in females &lt;50 years old [

         In a retrospective population-based cohort study looking at the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in pregnant people in the United States from 2010 to 2019, the prevalence of ischemic heart disease was 4.9 out of 10,000 patients, with stable ischemic heart disease accounting for the majority of cases [

         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         For females with a history of ischemic heart disease, it is recommended that prior to pregnancy, baseline left ventricular function should be determined, and stress testing may be beneficial to rule out active ischemia. Medications should be reviewed. ACE inhibitors and ARBS are contraindicated. Beta blockers and

         Intramuscular or intravenous opiates may be used to relieve pain and apprehension, but are not highly effective. Lumbar epidural anesthesia is highly effective for controlling labor pain and is recommended because it lowers pain-induced elevations of sympathetic activity, reduces the urge to push, and provides excellent anesthesia for operative procedures. The epidural should be dosed slowly with epidural solution (eg, local anesthetic plus opioid) to maintain stable hemodynamics and adequate uteroplacental blood flow since venous return can be reduced by the anesthetic. Intravenous fluid administration must be monitored carefully to avoid over or under hydration. (See

         Spontaneous onset of labor is preferred to induced labor for most women with heart disease [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Pregnant people with cardiac disease who are considered functionally normal or well-controlled should be allowed to go into labor spontaneously. If there are any concerns about the functional adequacy of the heart and circulation, induction of labor under controlled conditions is suggested. A planned daytime induction is the most practical. The timing of induction is individualized, taking into account the gravida's cardiac status, inducibility of the cervix, and fetal lung maturity. A long induction in a woman with an unfavorable cervix should be avoided. From a practical point of view, it may be useful to plan the induction so that delivery occurs during the working day when all hospital services are readily available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Induction of labor in a gravida with a favorable cervix usually requires only

          oxytocin
         </a>
         administration and artificial rupture of the membranes. An unfavorable cervix should be ripened with a prostaglandin E analogue. The softened, dilated cervix is more responsive to subsequent induction of labor and permits the normal physiologic sequence of softening and dilatation before the onset of uterine contractions. Prostaglandin analogues are absorbed into the systemic circulation and can lower systemic vascular resistance, lower systemic pressure, and increase heart rate [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. These effects are more frequent with E2 than E1 and when the drugs are used in the higher doses required for termination of pregnancy. Laminaria or a Foley catheter balloon can also be used for cervical ripening. (See

         Once in labor, the woman should be placed in a lateral decubitus position to attenuate the hemodynamic fluctuations associated with major uterine contractions and the supine position. The obstetrician should allow uterine contraction to descend the fetal head to the perineum, unassisted by maternal pushing, to avoid the undesirable circulatory effects of the Valsalva maneuver. Delivery may then be assisted by low forceps or vacuum extraction, as needed.

         A reduction in uterine blood flow and placental oxygen delivery typically occurs during uterine contractions; however, the fetus is adapted to extract enough oxygen to maintain fetal health. Complications of labor (eg, abruption, cord compression) or maternal hemodynamic instability may subject the fetus to decreased oxygenation and lead to fetal acidosis or death. The growth restricted fetus is especially vulnerable to hypoxia during labor. For this reason, continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring is recommended to assess fetal well-being during labor and allow timely intervention if nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns occur [

         Delivery is associated with hemodynamic changes that can lead to heart failure in women with preexisting cardiovascular disease (see

          "Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes"
         </a>
         ). As a result, hemodynamic monitoring of the mother is warranted for 12 to 24 hours after delivery [

         In patients requiring prolonged bed rest, meticulous leg care, elastic support stockings, and early ambulation are important preventive measures that reduce the risk of thromboembolism postpartum.

          Introduction and epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141103" href="/z/d/graphic/141103.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Care of high-risk patients requires a cardio-obstetric team, including at least a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, cardiologist, and obstetrical anesthesiologist. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction and epidemiology'

          Assessing risk
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Risk assessment of the patient with cardiac disease should be done using clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data. A commonly used risk assessment tool is CARPREG II. The modified WHO classification can also be used to predict risk.

         <strong>
          Brain natriuretic peptide
         </strong>
         – An elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) during pregnancy has been shown to be a predictor of cardiovascular events. BNP levels should be interpreted in the clinical context during pregnancy, as levels generally increase approximately twofold during uncomplicated pregnancy. A negative BNP is helpful to exclude heart failure. High-risk patients should have baseline and serial BNP levels monitored. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Brain natriuretic peptide'

         <strong>
          Cardiomyopathy
         </strong>
         – Women in their childbearing years may present with ventricular dysfunction from a number of etiologies: prior viral infection, HIV infection, peripartum cardiomyopathy, or drug-induced cardiomyopathy (eg, cocaine,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">
          doxorubicin
         </a>
         ). Women with prior peripartum cardiomyopathy in whom left ventricular function has returned to normal still remain at significant risk for morbidity during subsequent pregnancies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cardiomyopathy'

         <strong>
          Mode and timing of delivery
         </strong>
         – Most gravidas with cardiac disease can expect to attempt vaginal delivery because it poses less cardiac risk than cesarean delivery. Cesarean delivery should be reserved for standard obstetric indications such as failure to progress in labor, placenta previa, or fetal intolerance to labor. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mode and timing of delivery'
