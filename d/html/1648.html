Some blood gas analyzers also measure the methemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and hemoglobin levels. Such information is vital when caring for patients with critical illness, respiratory, or metabolic diseases.</p><p>The sites, techniques, and complications of arterial sampling and the interpretation of ABGs are reviewed here. Interpretation of venous blood gases and detailed discussion of acid-base disturbances are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2352.html" rel="external">"Simple and mixed acid-base disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16991.html" rel="external">"Venous blood gases and other alternatives to arterial blood gases"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H454078742"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ABGs are frequently used for the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification and monitoring of acid-base disturbances</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measurement of the partial pressures of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of the response to therapeutic interventions (eg, insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Detection and quantification of the levels of abnormal hemoglobins (eg, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Procurement of a blood sample in an acute emergency setting when venous sampling is not feasible (most tests can be performed from an arterial sample)</p><p></p><p>Absolute contraindications for ABG sampling include the following [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An abnormal modified Allen's test (see <a class="local">'Ensure collateral circulation'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Local infection, thrombus, or distorted anatomy at the puncture site (eg, previous surgical interventions, congenital or acquired malformations, burns, aneurysm, stent, arteriovenous fistula, vascular graft)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe peripheral vascular disease of the artery selected for sampling</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active Raynaud syndrome (particularly sampling at the radial site)</p><p></p><p>If a contraindication is present, in many cases an alternative site or consideration for using venous blood should be sought for sampling.</p><p>Supra therapeutic coagulopathy and infusion of thrombolytic agents (eg, during streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator infusion) are relative contraindications to arterial needle stick and absolute contraindications to indwelling catheter insertion. Although no cutoff has been suggested by any international societies, we suggest avoiding repeated arterial needle sticks when the international normalized ratio is ≥3 and/or the activated partial thromboplastin time is ≥100 seconds.</p><p>Similarly, arterial needle stick and catheterization can be performed in patients with thrombocytopenia a platelet count &gt;50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, but is generally avoided in those whose count is ≤30 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L. For those with counts between 30 and 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L limited needle stick sampling is sometimes performed, when necessary, with increased compression time. A platelet count &lt;50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L is generally a contraindication to arterial catheter insertion.</p><p>A history of Raynaud disease or Raynaud disease without active spasm, as well as evidence of poor peripheral perfusion (eg, cyanotic digits), are also considered by most experts as relative contraindications to radial arterial sampling.</p><p>Therapeutic anticoagulation is not a contraindication for arterial needle puncture, although the risk of bleeding is higher, but it is a relative contraindication for the insertion of an indwelling catheter. Increased vessel compression is appropriate in such patients. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> or other antiplatelet agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>) are not a contraindication for arterial vascular sampling in most cases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H454078749"><span class="h1">TECHNICAL CHALLENGES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ABG sampling may be difficult to perform in patients who are uncooperative or in whom pulses cannot be easily identified (eg, shock, vasopressor infusion, arteriosclerosis from end-stage kidney disease, calcification of the vessel wall). Difficulties can also arise when the patient cannot be positioned appropriately (eg, cannot fully extend the wrists for radial artery access due to tremor or joint contractures) or in patients with obesity or who are edematous in whom large amounts of subcutaneous tissue may obscure the usual anatomic landmarks. In some of these scenarios, ultrasound may be useful to locate the artery and reduce potential complications of repeated puncture and consequent injury to the target vessel and surrounding tissue.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ARTERIAL SAMPLING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arterial blood is required for an ABG. It can be obtained by percutaneous needle puncture or from an indwelling arterial catheter. Written consent is not usually required for arterial needle stick puncture but is required for the insertion of an indwelling catheter. Regardless, the risks and benefits of each procedure should be explained to the patient.</p><p>Ultrasound is not routinely used but can be used to direct access when sampling by the standard approach has been unsuccessful or is not feasible (eg, weak pulses, patient on multiple vasopressors, patients with obesity). When used, ultrasound-guided access may increase the operator's ability to enter the vessel and helps minimize injury to the artery and adjacent nerves and veins.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Needle puncture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Percutaneous needle puncture refers to the withdrawal of arterial blood via a needle stick. It needs to be repeated every time an ABG is performed, since an indwelling catheter is not inserted. Thus, it is suitable for patients who require a limited number of arterial draws (eg, daily or less than once daily during an admission to hospital). If recurrent sampling (eg, more than four draws in 24 hours) is required, clinicians should, at minimum, rotate puncture sites (eg, right and left radial) or consider placing an indwelling catheter. (See <a class="local">'Indwelling catheters'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8174.html" rel="external">"Intra-arterial catheterization for invasive monitoring: Indications, insertion techniques, and interpretation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Site selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial step in percutaneous needle puncture is locating a palpable artery. Common sites include the radial, femoral, brachial, dorsalis pedis, or axillary artery. There is no evidence that any site is superior to the others. However, the radial artery is used most often because it is accessible and more comfortable for the patient than the alternative sites. The radial artery is also typically used for outpatients, while all sites can be used for inpatients who require an ABG.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radial artery</strong> – The radial artery is best palpated between the distal radius and the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis when the wrist is extended (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55221" href="/d/graphic/55221.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82119" href="/d/graphic/82119.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Although infrequently performed, the arm can be taped (at the level of the forearm and palm) to an armboard with the palm facing upward; a large roll of gauze also can be placed between the wrist and the armboard in a position that extends the wrist. Over extension should be avoided as extension of the overlying flexor tendons may make the pulse difficult to detect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Brachial artery</strong> – The brachial artery is best palpated medial to the biceps tendon in the antecubital fossa, when the arm is extended and the palm is facing up (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57543" href="/d/graphic/57543.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The arm is placed on a firm surface (an armboard can be used similar to that described for the radial artery above) with the shoulder slightly abducted, the elbow extended, and the forearm in full supination. The needle should be inserted just above the elbow crease at a 30-degree angle (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69312" href="/d/graphic/69312.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). It is usually harder to access because it runs deeper in the arm than the radial artery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Femoral artery</strong> – The femoral artery is best palpated just below the midpoint of the inguinal ligament, when the lower extremity is extended and the patient is lying supine (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75120" href="/d/graphic/75120.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The needle should be inserted at a 90-degree angle just below the inguinal ligament (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50204" href="/d/graphic/50204.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Axillary artery</strong> – The axillary artery is best palpated in the axilla, when the arm is abducted and externally rotated (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55334" href="/d/graphic/55334.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). The needle should be inserted as high into the apex of the axilla as possible (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67106" href="/d/graphic/67106.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dorsalis pedis</strong> – The dorsalis pedis artery can be occluded by the forefinger followed by compression of the nail bed of the great toe and assessment of the rapidity with which color returns to the nail bed after pressure is released from the great toe (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54240" href="/d/graphic/54240.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). The needle can be inserted at a 30-degree angle lateral to the extensor tendon at the level of the midfoot.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Ensure collateral circulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One of the risks associated with arterial puncture is ischemia distal to the puncture site (see <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below). Although rarely performed in practice, identifying collateral flow to the region supplied by the artery can be used by clinicians prior to puncture. While limited studies have found variable accuracy associated with such evaluations, we believe that patients, and in particular high risk patients, undergoing radial or dorsalis pedis artery puncture should have the collateral flow to those vessels evaluated [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Our belief is based upon the concept that it avoids potential harm by identifying patients who have impaired collateral circulation and who are therefore at increased risk of an ischemic complication, and in whom an alternative site should be sought. In addition, the evaluation can be performed quickly at the bedside and at no cost.</p><p>Radial and dorsalis pedis artery puncture are at highest risk of this complication (because they are small in diameter). They receive collateral supply from the ulnar and lateral plantar artery, respectively. It is this collateral supply that is identified by the following tests:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radial artery</strong> – The Allen's test or modified Allen's test are bedside tests that can be performed in patients undergoing radial artery puncture to demonstrate collateral flow from the ulnar artery through the superficial palmar arch (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55221" href="/d/graphic/55221.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Modified Allen's test</strong> – The patient's hand is initially held high with the fist clenched. <strong>Both</strong> the radial and ulnar arteries are compressed firmly by the two thumbs of the investigator (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70306" href="/d/graphic/70306.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). This allows the blood to drain from the hand. The hand is then lowered and the fist is opened (the palm will appear white). Overextension of the hand or wide spreading of the fingers should be avoided because it may cause false-normal results. The pressure is released from the ulnar artery while occlusion is maintained on the radial artery. A pink color should return to the palm, usually within six seconds, indicating that the ulnar artery is patent and the superficial palmar arch is intact. Although the timing of return of circulation to the palm varies considerably, the test is generally considered abnormal if ten seconds or more elapses before color returns to the hand (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79685" href="/d/graphic/79685.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>The Allen's test</strong> – The Allen's test (from which the modified Allen's test evolved) is performed identically, except these steps are executed twice: once with release of pressure from the ulnar artery while occlusion is maintained on the radial artery, and once with release of pressure from the radial artery while occlusion is maintained on the ulnar artery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other</strong> – Finger pulse plethysmography, Doppler flow measurements, and measurement of the arterial systolic pressure of the thumb have been described but are not routinely used [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dorsalis pedis artery</strong> – An Allen's<strong> </strong>test to assess the collateral circulation of the posterior tibialis is performed by elevating the leg until the plantar skin blanches followed by compression of dorsalis pedis pulse by the clinician's thumb and lowering of leg to dependency. The foot rapidly resumes its normal color if the posterior tibial artery flow is adequate.</p><p></p><p>The risk of ischemic complications is low for the axillary artery because the arm receives good collateral flow through the thyrocervical trunk and subscapular artery. Thus, no collateral supply testing is typically performed prior to arterial puncture. However, assessing distal brachial and radial artery pulses is appropriate in patients who have had anatomic, pathologic abnormalities of the thoracic outlet; if distal pulses are weak, an alternative site should be sought.</p><p>The femoral artery is large such that ischemia is rare. However, the distal pedal pulses of the lower limb should be assessed first. If pedal pulses are severely diminished or absent, peripheral arterial disease may be present and an alternative arterial puncture site should be sought.</p><p>Similarly, pulses distal to the brachial artery must be assessed prior to the procedure. In patients with absent pulses at the wrist (ie, in the radial and ulnar arteries), an alternative site for arterial sampling should be sought.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H454079094"><span class="h3">Equipment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As for all procedures, the equipment necessary should be brought to the bedside prior to the procedure. This includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonsterile gloves</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antiseptic skin solution (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> and povidone-iodine are solutions)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ABG kit OR a pre-heparinized 3 mL ABG syringe with a 22 to 25-gauge needle and syringe cap</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2 × 2-inch sterile gauze</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adhesive bandage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Plastic hazard bag with ice (if not provided in the kit)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sharp object container</p><p></p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">Lidocaine</a> (eg, 1 or 2 percent) without epinephrine may be required should the clinician feel that anesthesia is necessary or the patient requests it.</p><p>ABG kits (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103744" href="/d/graphic/103744.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) are used by clinicians in most institutions to draw arterial blood. Kits contain a heparinized plastic syringe with the plunger already pulled back to allow for the collection of 2 mL of blood, a protective needle sleeve, a needle, syringe cap, and ice bag. The sleeve, while attached to the syringe, locks the needle within itself to prevent direct contact between operator and needle. It is removed to expose the needle. The prefilled heparin is expelled (incomplete dismissal of heparin falsely lowers the partial pressure of carbon dioxide), and the plunger is then repositioned at the 2 mL mark.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alternatively a heparinized ABG syringe can be used. Approximately 2 mL of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9566" href="/d/drug information/9566.html" rel="external">lithium</a> heparin (1000 units/mL) can be aspirated into a syringe through a 22 to 25-gauge needle and then pushed out; the plunger should be left leaving a small empty volume (eg, usually 2 mL) in the syringe.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a palpable artery has been located, blood is withdrawn using the following steps.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The planned puncture site should be sterilely prepared.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Local analgesia with injectable 1 to 2 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> can be administered but is not usually performed [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. If local anesthesia is employed (eg, requested by the patient, difficult or prolonged needle stick is preempted), 0.5 to 1 mL of the anesthetic is injected to create a small dermal papule at the site of puncture; using larger amounts or injecting the anesthetic into deeper planes may distort the anatomy and hinder identification of the vessel [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Traditionally, it was believed that the injection of lidocaine is as painful as the procedure itself so many clinicians avoid using it for this reason. However, in our experience, when performed by personnel experienced in arterial draws, no anesthesia is typically needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although no anesthesia is typically performed, one study that compared levels of pain associated with the procedure reported that patients who received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9610" href="/d/drug information/9610.html" rel="external">mepivacaine</a> and cryoanalgesia had less pain than those who received no anesthetic [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Topical anesthetic cream did not appear to have a significant effect on pain. Another study reported analgesic effect with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8930" href="/d/drug information/8930.html" rel="external">ethyl chloride</a> spray [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ABG kits are used by clinicians in most institutions to draw arterial blood. Alternatively, a heparinized syringe can be used. The kit or syringe is prepared as described above. (See <a class="local">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One or two fingers should be used to gently palpate the artery while holding the needle in the other hand. Both fingers should be proximal to the desired puncture site; placing the nondominant middle finger distally and the nondominant index finger proximally, with the needle insertion site in between, is not recommended, because of the increased risk of needle stick injury. The artery should be punctured with the needle at a 30 to 45-degree angle (radial, brachial, axillary, dorsalis pedis) or at a 90-degree angle (femoral artery) relative to the skin.

(See <a class="local">'Ensure collateral circulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Technique</strong> – Once the target artery has been identified, the planned puncture site should be sterilely prepared. Injectable <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> is typically not used. The artery should be punctured with a small needle and syringe, 2 to 3 mL of blood should be withdrawn, and then the needle should be removed. Finally, pressure should be applied to the puncture site for five minutes or longer. (See <a class="local">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Complications due to percutaneous needle puncture are rare but include pain, bleeding, bruising, hematoma, nerve injury, and vasospasm. Infection, limb ischemia, and compartment syndrome are rare but serious complications. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indwelling catheters</strong> – Indwelling catheters provide continuous access to arterial blood, which is helpful when frequent blood gases are needed (eg, patients in respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, patients requiring serial ABGs for monitoring acid-base disorders). The sample preparation and care are the same as for ABGs drawn using a needle. (See <a class="local">'Indwelling catheters'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8174.html" rel="external">"Intra-arterial catheterization for invasive monitoring: Indications, insertion techniques, and interpretation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Avoiding error</strong> – Regardless of the method used to withdraw the arterial blood, the amount of heparin solution should be minimized, at least 2 mL of blood should be obtained, air bubbles should be removed, and the specimen should immediately be placed on ice and analyzed as quickly as possible. Results are usually available within 5 to 15 minutes. (See <a class="local">'Sources of error'</a> above and <a class="local">'Transport and analysis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interpretation</strong> – When interpreting ABGs, we consider the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Normal ranges</strong> – The range of normal values varies among laboratories. In general, the normal pH is 7.35 to 7.45, the normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> is 35 to 45 mmHg (4.7 to 6 kPa), and the normal HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration is 21 to 27 mEq/L. Normal PaO<sub>2</sub> and SaO<sub>2</sub> have not been defined; however, it seems reasonable to consider a resting PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;80 mmHg (10.7 kPa) and SaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;95 percent normal, unless the new values are substantially different than prior values. (See <a class="local">'Normal values'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Assessing abnormal values</strong> – Measurement of the PaO<sub>2</sub> and SaO<sub>2</sub> provide data on oxygenation (hypoxemia or hyperoxia). Measurement of the pH, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and base excess provide sufficient data to accurately assess ventilation (respiratory acidosis and alkalosis) as well as assess complex and simple acid-base disturbances (metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis). Measurement of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin is rarely indicated but should be assessed when abnormally high levels are suspected (eg, carbon monoxide poisoning, lidocaine-induced methemoglobinemia, respectively). (See <a class="local">'Oxygenation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ventilation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Acid-base balance'</a> above and <a class="local">'Abnormal hemoglobins'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sources of error</strong> – Sources of error include gas diffusion (falsely low PaO<sub>2</sub>), incomplete dismissal of heparin (falsely low pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub>), and air bubbles (falsely high PaO<sub>2</sub> and a falsely low PaCO<sub>2</sub>). ABGs estimate the systemic acid-base balance but may not reflect the acid-base status at the tissue level in states of shock.
