AF is generally associated with an irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm and absence of distinct P waves. This topic will provide a broad overview of the classification, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and sequelae of AF, including new-onset AF.</p><p>The initiation and maintenance of AF reflect electrophysiologic alterations in atrial myocardium. The pathophysiology of AF is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16402.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology of AF including prevalence, risk factors, and associated chronic conditions is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1004.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p>The following topics provide detail about specific types of AF and other management issues:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1045.html" rel="external">"Management of atrial fibrillation: Rhythm control versus rate control"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/938.html" rel="external">"Control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have heart failure: Pharmacologic therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AF can be classified according to its duration and length of episodes; these were described in the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines on AF management [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Paroxysmal (ie, self-terminating or intermittent) AF</strong> – Paroxysmal AF is defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within seven days of onset. Episodes may recur with variable frequency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/956.html" rel="external">"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Persistent AF</strong> – Persistent AF is defined as AF that fails to self-terminate within seven days. Episodes often require pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. While a patient who has had persistent AF can have later episodes of paroxysmal AF, AF is generally considered a progressive disease. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-standing persistent AF</strong> – Long-standing persistent AF refers to AF that has lasted for more than 12 months.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Permanent AF</strong> – Permanent AF is a term used to identify persistent AF for which a joint decision by the patient and clinician has been made to no longer pursue a rhythm control strategy. Acceptance of persistent AF may change as symptoms, therapeutic options, and patient and clinician preferences evolve [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p></p><p>While AF typically progresses from paroxysmal to persistent states, patients can present with both types throughout their lives. </p><p>AF can also be classified based by the way it presents or whether specific valvular conditions are present:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subclinical or</strong> <strong>occult AF </strong>– This refers to AF that is largely asymptomatic and only becomes apparent in the setting of a thromboembolic event, acute heart failure exacerbation, other medical illness, or upon routine electrocardiogram (ECG) done for other purposes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1090.html" rel="external">"Cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)", section on 'Occult atrial fibrillation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1083.html" rel="external">"Overview of the evaluation of stroke", section on 'Monitoring for subclinical atrial fibrillation'</a> and <a class="local">'Common scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Screening for AF is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Screening'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Valvular AF </strong>– This refers to patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis; these patients have a higher risk of stroke than patients without this condition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lone AF </strong>– The term "lone AF" is a historical term that is now disfavored, as it may be confusing and does not enhance patient care [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The term lone AF has been used to describe AF in younger patients (eg, ≤60 years) with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF who have no structural heart disease or cardiovascular risk factors. These characteristics identify a group of individuals with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of "0" and who are at lowest risk for thromboembolism from AF. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128998.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Selection of candidates for anticoagulation", section on 'CHA2DS2-VASc score'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3822365820"><span class="h1">SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not currently screen asymptomatic patients for AF. In a general population and among persons &gt;65 years of age, screening has not been shown to be better than usual care (eg, pulse palpation on physical examination) for AF detection. Furthermore, screening showed modest to no benefit on reducing cardiovascular outcomes and death in one of two randomized studies. Screening may lead to more anticoagulation, but this has not been shown to be associated with robust protection from stroke or thromboembolic events [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) also does not recommend screening for AF.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effects on cardiovascular outcomes and death</strong> – Two randomized studies of screening for AF (with either single-lead ECGs or implantable loop recorders) showed only a modest or no reduction in clinical events and are also limited in that they included a narrow patient population that may not be widely generalizable. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A randomized, unmasked, parallel group study in Sweden (STROKESTOP) of 28,768 individuals aged 75 to 76 years compared outcomes (ie, a composite of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding leading to hospitalization, and all-cause death) in patients who underwent two-week intermittent ECG screening with subsequent anticoagulation strategy versus those who received usual care [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. After a median follow-up of 6.9 years, somewhat fewer outcomes occurred in the intervention group than in the control group (5.45 versus 5.68 events per 100 years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.96; 95% CI 0.92-1.00), but the overall risks and absolute benefit are very low. However, despite this low absolute risk reduction, an analysis using a Markov model based on the STROKESTOP study suggested that screening for AF in this older adult population may still be cost effective and possibly even cost saving [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the LOOP study, 6004 individuals with stroke risk factors were randomly assigned to either implantable loop recorder monitoring (also called implantable cardiac monitor) or usual care [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Those in the implantable loop recorder group had three times the rates of AF detection and anticoagulation initiation but no change in rates of stroke or arterial embolization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>AF detection </strong>–<strong> </strong>Data are mixed as to whether screening for AF increases the number of new AF cases detected; however, the potential benefit appears to be small at best. The choice of test used to detect AF and population characteristics likely impacts these results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the VITAL-AF trial, 16 primary clinics were randomly assigned either to AF screening using a handheld single-lead ECG (AliveCor KardiaMobile) during vital sign assessments or to usual care [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. More than 30,000 patients ≥65 years of age were followed for one year for the development of new-onset AF. New AF diagnosis in the screening and control groups was similar (1.72 versus 1.59 percent). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of persons aged ≥85 years, new AF diagnoses were more frequent in the screening versus control group (5.56 versus 3.76 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a meta-analysis of three cluster randomized studies (not including VITAL-AF), screening identified more cases of AF compared with no screening when using one-time approaches (pulse palpation, ECG, and/or Holter monitor [absolute risk difference range 0.06 to 0.60 percentage points; relative risk range 1.04 to 1.58]). However, this difference was small and statistically significant in only one of the studies in the meta-analysis [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The Apple Watch in combination with iPhone application was evaluated in over 400,000 individuals without a history of AF [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Irregular pulse notifications were sent to 2161 participants (0.52 percent). Of these, 450 participants were sent and returned an ECG patch and were not otherwise excluded per study protocol. AF was present in 34 percent of 450 patients. Among those who were notified of an irregular pulse on the watch while wearing the patch, 84 percent were concordant with AF. The Apple Watch study did not employ the gold standard reference of 12-lead ECG analyzed by two cardiologists, which limits interpretation of device accuracy for AF detection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Accuracy of detection method </strong>–<strong> </strong>The accuracies of specific AF detection tests were reviewed by the USPSTF [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In most studies, test accuracy was measured against the reference of 12-lead ECG (interpreted by two cardiologists). Sensitivity and specificity were generally high for single-lead ECG and oscillometric blood pressure monitors. Implantable cardiac monitors are more sensitive than ECG and external monitoring [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ECGs do not appear more effective than pulse palpation at AF detection. A USPSTF review of randomized trials and observational studies (17 studies and 135,300 patients age 65 years and older) found that systematic screening with ECG identified more cases of AF than no screening (absolute increase from 0.6 to 2.8 percent over 12 months) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, systematic screening with ECG did not detect more cases than a systematic approach using pulse palpation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Enrichment of population to be screened </strong>–<strong> </strong>Although at this time there is no sufficient evidence to screen for AF in broad populations, focusing screening efforts on patients at significantly higher risk for development of AF may be more fruitful. Using the CHADS2-VASc score can be a starting point, but risk scores such as the CHARGE-AF score derived from clinical variables [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], or a polygenic risk score derived from genetic testing [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] may potentially be more effective.</p><p></p><p>The role of evaluating patients with cryptogenic stroke for AF is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1090.html" rel="external">"Cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)", section on 'Occult atrial fibrillation'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1622109113"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2071526543"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AF may or may not have associated symptoms, and the spectrum of symptoms is broad and nonspecific. Typical symptoms include the following: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpitations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tachycardia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weakness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dizziness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lightheadedness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced exercise capacity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased urination</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mild dyspnea. </p><p></p><p>Some patients have more severe symptoms. These include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dyspnea at rest</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Angina</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presyncope or rarely syncope </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms of stroke or other systemic embolic event </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea on exertion, peripheral edema, weight gain, and abdominal swelling from ascites)</p><p></p><p>The severity and extent of symptoms are affected by the patient's underlying cardiac condition, age, presence of diabetes [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>], and rapidity and regularity of the ventricular response. For example, one study of 2400 AF patients showed that the 420 patients with diabetes felt fewer AF-related symptoms (eg, palpitations, dizziness, exercise intolerance [odds ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.92]), but had a worse quality of life (beta = -4.54; 95% CI -6.40 to -2.68) than those without diabetes [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Quality of life was measured on the 100-point European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D).</p><p>The hemodynamic consequences of AF are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1041.html" rel="external">"Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3124257742"><span class="h2">Common scenarios</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A new diagnosis of AF may result from several clinical scenarios that are described below:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At the time of a routine examination, during which the patient complains of symptoms possibly due to AF or is being evaluated for another reason and is found to have an irregularly irregular pulse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On an ECG obtained for other reasons such as a preoperative evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1014.html" rel="external">"The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A patient with a stroke or other arterial thromboembolism can be found to have AF that had not been previously diagnosed [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In some cases, AF is detected during extended monitoring in an attempt to diagnose the cause for the stroke. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1059.html" rel="external">"Stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1090.html" rel="external">"Cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)", section on 'Occult atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Subclinical AF can be also detected by intracardiac, implantable, or wearable monitors [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Subclinical AF usually occurs in individuals without characteristic symptoms of AF and without a prior diagnosis. Most of these individuals will have paroxysmal AF. A scientific statement from the American Heart Association on subclinical and cardiac implantable electronic device-detected AF was published in 2019 [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/956.html" rel="external">"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation", section on 'Evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/921.html" rel="external">"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: Overview of indications, components, and functions", section on 'ECG monitoring and storage'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The ASSERT study of 2580 patients (65 years or older) with either a dual-chamber pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, hypertension, and no history of AF found that at three months, subclinical AF was detected in about 10 percent of patients [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Clinical AF developed in about 16 percent of patients with subclinical AF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a study of 590 individuals with stroke risk factors but without AF who underwent screening with an implantable loop recorder for an average of 40 months, 35 percent of participants were found to have AF [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>During ECG monitoring with a 24-hour ambulatory monitor obtained for some other reason or during interrogation of an implanted cardiac rhythm device.

When one assesses the rates of the left ventricular apex and the radial pulse simultaneously, the radial pulse rate may be less than the apical heart rate. Since the heart rate is irregular, some ventricular contractions will occur, preceded by shorter periods of diastole in which there is a reduction in left ventricular filling. This results in ventricular beats with insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave to the arm. Variation in cuff blood pressure readings is also common during AF due to changes in the beat-to-beat cadence and changes in left ventricular filling and stroke volume. It is often necessary to measure the blood pressure multiple times and average these values to obtain a more accurate blood pressure readings. In addition, automated blood pressure machines may have difficulty in accurately measuring blood pressure during AF, so a manual blood pressure check is recommended. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Electrocardiogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with suspected new-onset AF, we obtain a 12-lead ECG.

If rate control does not work and the patient remains hemodynamically unstable, we pursue cardioversion; if we decide to perform emergency cardioversion, the risk for a thromboembolic event needs to be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/906.html" rel="external">"Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation", section on 'AF duration less than 48 hours'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Stable patients</strong> – For stable patients, usually in the nonacute care setting, we discuss the need for possible cardioversion, need for acute and long-term anticoagulant therapy, the cause (if known), and natural history of AF. (See <a class="local">'Sequelae'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">We consider consultation with a cardiologist.

Lifestyle modification with reducing alcohol consumption, weight reduction, and increasing physical activity can reduce AF burden and decrease recurrence. (See <a class="local">'Long-term management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sequelae </strong>–<strong> </strong>In the absence of a reversible precipitant, AF is typically recurrent. AF is associated with increased risk of mortality, stroke, silent cerebral ischemia, cognitive impairment, dementia, and heart failure. Physical activity and higher cardiorespiratory fitness may protect against mortality in AF.
