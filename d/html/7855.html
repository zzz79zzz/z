The clinical manifestations of central hypothyroidism are similar to but sometimes milder than those of primary hypothyroidism.

Thyroid hormone has been administered to euthyroid patients with several clinical problems in whom it was hoped that outcome would be improved. These include T3 therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and in those with refractory depression in an attempt to enhance the response to antidepressant drug therapy. A meta-analysis on the efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy in depressed patients was equivocal [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Although there was evidence for overall benefit, the analysis limited to randomized, double-blind trials revealed no benefit of synthetic T3. In addition, T3 did not help in an open-label study of patients with severe depression [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Finally, T4 therapy in euthyroid patients with "hypothyroid symptoms" was no more effective than placebo in ameliorating symptoms [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2890829890"><span class="h2">Goals of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of therapy are to: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ameliorate symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Normalize serum TSH secretion</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduce goiter size (if present)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis)</p><p></p><p>We aim to keep serum TSH within the normal reference range (approximately 0.5 to 5.0 mU/L). However, it is important to note that there is an age-related shift towards higher TSH concentrations in older patients (eg, ≥70 years), with an upper limit of normal of approximately 7.5 mU/L in 80 year olds. Among patients with goiter, approximately 50 percent will have some decrease in goiter size, which lags behind the fall in TSH secretion [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. </p><p>There is considerable controversy as to the appropriate upper limit of normal for serum TSH [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Most laboratories have used values of approximately 4.5 to 5.0 mU/L. However, others have argued that the upper limit of normal of the euthyroid reference range should be reduced to 2.5 mU/L because 95 percent of rigorously screened, young, euthyroid volunteers have serum values between 0.4 and 2.5 mU/L [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In contrast, others have reported that age-adjusted upper limits of normal for TSH should be higher than 4.5 to 5 mU/L, especially for patients over age 70 years [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Until there are data demonstrating an adverse biologic impact for serum TSH values between 2.5 and 5.0 mU/L, the wisdom of labeling such patients as hypothyroid is questionable [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This topic is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7891.html" rel="external">"Laboratory assessment of thyroid function", section on 'Serum TSH'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to patients with persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism despite adequate treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> (eg, a normal serum TSH level) is reviewed below.

T4 is a prohormone with very little intrinsic activity. It is deiodinated in peripheral tissues to form T3, the active thyroid hormone. This deiodination process accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total daily production of T3 in normal subjects. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of a dose of T4 is absorbed and, because the plasma half-life of T4 is long (seven days), once-daily treatment results in nearly constant serum T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations when a steady state is reached [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">T4 formulations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>T4 is available in tablet, soft gel, and liquid formulations [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Either a generic or a brand-name formulation of T4 is acceptable. The brand-name and most generic formulations are available in color-coded tablets at small increments in hormone content to allow precise titration of the dose according to the serum concentration of TSH.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tablet versus soft gel capsule or liquid</strong> – Most patients are treated with a T4 tablet. While in one study, the pharmacokinetics of the soft gel capsule were similar to tablets in healthy individuals [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], in other studies, the soft gel capsule was less dependent upon gastric pH than a branded tablet [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. Thus, the soft gel capsule or liquid is an option for patients with suspected poor absorption of the standard solid tablet [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], especially in the presence of atrophic gastritis. It may also be better absorbed after bariatric surgery [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, another, less costly option is to increase the dose of a generic T4 tablet with monitoring of TSH.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Generic versus brand name</strong> – Either a generic or a brand-name formulation of T4 is acceptable [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There has been considerable controversy about the bioequivalence of the various T4 formulations. In the past, variation in the T4 content of brand-name and generic formulations led many experts to prefer a specific manufacturer [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In 1997, a study of two brand-name and two generic formulations of T4, using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended methodology for determining bioequivalence, reported that all four were equivalent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The methodology used to determine bioequivalence in the study is considered by some to be flawed since endogenous T4 concentrations were not taken into account [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although the use of brand-name T4 products might be preferred theoretically to avoid the issue of variable bioavailabilities when there is interchange of different generic manufacturers by the pharmacy, often this is not possible, because of cost considerations. In addition, it has yet to be shown that switching among various generic manufacturers is a clinical problem. In the United States, the manufacturer of the generic formulation is included on the label. (See <a class="local">'Switching between T4 manufacturers'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Dose and monitoring</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3269250293"><span class="h3">Initial dose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The average full replacement dose of T4 in adults is approximately 1.6 mcg/kg body weight per day (112 mcg/day in a 70-kg adult), but the range of required doses is wide, varying from 50 to ≥200 mcg/day. T4 requirements correlate better with lean body mass than total body weight [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In one study, the average full replacement dose after thyroidectomy was 1.76 mcg/kg body weight for body mass index (BMI) &lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 1.47 mcg/kg for BMI 25 to 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 1.42 mcg/kg for BMI 30 to 34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 1.27 mcg/kg for BMI 35 to 39 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 1.28 mcg/kg for BMI over 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>The initial dose can be the full anticipated dose (approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day) in young, healthy patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131462" data-inline-graphics="131462" href="/z/d/graphic/131462.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Older patients (eg, &gt;60 years) or those with coronary heart disease, in whom the duration of hypothyroidism is unknown, should be started on a lower dose (25 to 50 mcg daily). If the duration of hypothyroidism is known to be short, eg, less than approximately two months, starting doses in older patients or in those with coronary heart disease can be two-thirds to three-quarters of the anticipated dose needed to achieve a euthyroid state. (See <a class="local">'Older patients or those with coronary heart disease'</a> below.)</p><p>In one prospective study of different starting doses of T4, 50 hypothyroid patients (mean age 47 years but some patients were in their 70s and 80s) were randomly assigned to receive a full starting dose of T4 (1.6 mcg/kg/day) or T4 25 mcg/day with dose adjustments every four weeks. Euthyroidism was achieved more rapidly in the full-dose group, but signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and quality of life improved at a similar rate in the two groups. No adverse cardiac effects were seen in either group, but the subjects in the study, including the older patients, had been carefully screened to rule out cardiovascular disease prior to enrollment [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In another study of post-thyroidectomy patients, only 285 of 951 (30 percent) who received initial weight-based dosing of T4 met their TSH goal at the first postoperative assessment [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In a validation cohort, a T4 dose calculator based on weight, height, age, sex, and calcium supplementation and developed using machine learning methods was able to modestly increase the number of patients meeting their TSH goal to 43.2 percent (329 of 762 patients). Further validation of the calculator is needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Timing of dose</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>T4 (tablets, gel capsules, or liquid) should be taken on an empty stomach with water, ideally 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>T4 (tablets, gel capsules, or liquid) should not be taken with other meds that interfere with its absorption (eg, bile acid resins, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9185" href="/z/d/drug information/9185.html" rel="external">calcium carbonate</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8444" href="/z/d/drug information/8444.html" rel="external">ferrous sulfate</a>).

The proximity to food ingestion, rather than time of day, is the more critical parameter. A meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in effectiveness of morning versus bedtime dosing based on TSH measurements [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. In some studies, serum TSH concentrations were lower and less variable with standard fasting administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> than with nonfasting administration (eg, mean serum TSH 1.06±1.23, 2.93±3.29, and 2.19±2.66 mU/L if taken one hour before breakfast, with breakfast, or at bedtime two hours after the last meal, respectively) [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. In another small study, there was no difference in serum TSH levels after ingestion of liquid T4 at breakfast compared with the same dose 30 minutes prior to breakfast [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. In some studies, consumption of coffee and tea within one hour of levothyroxine intake interfered with tablet absorption [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. In two small studies, espresso coffee, in comparison with water, appeared to interfere with T4 absorption of levothyroxine tablets [<a href="#rid32">32</a>] but not soft gel capsules [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Initial monitoring and dose adjustments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who are treated with T4 usually begin to improve symptomatically within two weeks, but complete recovery can take several months in those with severe hypothyroidism. Although symptoms may begin to resolve after two to three weeks, steady-state TSH concentrations are not achieved for at least six weeks. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations increase first and then TSH secretion begins to fall because of the negative feedback action of T4 on the pituitary and hypothalamus.</p><p>After initiation of T4 therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient with symptomatic improvement should be re-evaluated and serum TSH measured in four to six weeks  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131462" href="/z/d/graphic/131462.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). If the TSH remains above the reference range, the dose of T4 can be increased by 12 to 25 mcg/day in older patients, or it can be increased by a higher dose in younger patients based on the degree to which the initial dose increased free T4 concentrations and reduced TSH concentrations. The patient will require a repeat TSH measurement in six weeks. (See <a class="local">'Adjustment of maintenance dose'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient with persistent symptoms after two to three weeks should be reevaluated and a serum free T4 and TSH measured in three weeks. If the serum free T4 is below normal, the dose can be increased at three weeks without additional testing, but it should be recognized that serum T4 (and TSH) concentrations at this time are not steady-state values, and serum TSH levels may still be falling despite normal (or even high) serum T4 concentrations. Given the one-week plasma half-life of T4, it takes approximately six weeks (six half-lives) before a steady state is attained after therapy is initiated or the dose is changed.</p><p></p><p>This process of increasing the dose of T4 every three to six weeks (depending upon the patient's symptoms) should continue, based upon periodic measurements of serum TSH (and free T4 if steady-state conditions have not yet been achieved), until the high values of TSH in patients with primary hypothyroidism return to the reference range. (See <a class="local">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The maintenance dose may vary according to the cause of hypothyroidism. In a study of patients receiving chronic T4 therapy who were clinically euthyroid and had serum free T4 index values within the upper half of the normal range and normal serum TSH concentration, 73 patients with hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis or radioiodine therapy were receiving less T4 (118 mcg/day, 1.6 mcg/kg/day) than 36 patients with thyroid cancer after near-total thyroidectomy (152 mcg/day, 2.1 mcg/kg/day) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. In 36 patients with central hypothyroidism and similar serum free T4 index values, the T4 dose was higher (155 mcg/day, 1.9 mcg/kg/day). These results suggest that both normal amounts of TSH and the presence of residual thyroid tissue are determinants of T4 dose in patients with hypothyroidism.

In fact, T3 serum levels may be elevated three to four hours after the last dose (eg, at noon if the dose is taken at 8 AM) and low if T3 is measured before the next dose.

Since T3 is approximately four times as metabolically active as T4, 9 mcg T3 is equivalent to approximately 36 mcg T4; therefore, 1 grain would be equivalent to approximately 74 mcg T4. However, in a randomized trial comparing T4 with desiccated thyroid extract, 1 grain (60 mg) of extract was equivalent to 88 mcg of T4 [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. Both of these conversions result in lower amounts of T4 than traditionally recommended; the United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information suggests 1 grain (60 mg) is roughly equivalent to 100 mcg of T4 [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. Therefore, many clinicians use a simple conversion factor of 1 grain = 100 mcg T4. For a patient who is taking 1.5 grains (90 mg) of desiccated thyroid, an equivalent T4 dose ranges from 112 to 150 mcg. Some clinicians prefer to begin with the higher dose (150 mcg) and slowly taper the dose if the TSH measured six weeks after switching remains below the reference range.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1415516327"><span class="h3">Converting from combined T4 and T3 therapy to T4 monotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients converting from T4-T3 combination therapy back to T4 monotherapy, the equivalent dose of T4 can be calculated by considering that T3 is three to four times more potent metabolically than T4.

(See <a class="local">'Initial dose'</a> above and <a class="local">'Timing of dose'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial monitoring and dose adjustments</strong> – After initiation of T4 therapy, the patient should be reevaluated and serum TSH should be measured in six weeks and the dose adjusted accordingly  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131462" href="/z/d/graphic/131462.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Symptoms may begin to resolve after two to three weeks, but steady-state TSH concentrations are not achieved for at least six weeks. After identification of the proper maintenance dose, the patient should be examined and serum TSH measured once yearly or more often if there is an abnormal result or a change in the patient's status  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60325" href="/z/d/graphic/60325.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

However, switching from one manufacturer of T4 to another is usually not a clinical problem. If a switch from one manufacturer to another is made by the pharmacy and the patient is concerned regarding equivalent efficacy of the formulations, or if maintaining the serum TSH within a narrow range is important (eg, thyroid cancer treatment), we measure a serum TSH six weeks after changing to document that the serum TSH is still within the therapeutic target. (See <a class="local">'T4 formulations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Persistent symptoms on T4 monotherapy</strong> – The possibility of an inadequate current T4 dose should be verified by measuring serum TSH before the dose is increased. In addition, clinicians should evaluate for alternative causes of the symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Persistent symptoms on T4 monotherapy (normal or minimally elevated TSH)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>TSH in upper half to just above reference range</strong> – If a patient has possible hypothyroid symptoms and the serum TSH is confirmed by repeat measurement to be at the upper limits or above the reference range, it is reasonable to increase the dose and to aim for a serum TSH value in the lower half of the normal range; however, improved symptoms with higher doses may be based on expectation of benefit rather than a true physiologic advantage. (See <a class="local">'TSH in upper half of or above reference range'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>TSH in mid to lower half of reference range</strong> – For most patients with persistent symptoms with normal TSH, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using combination T4-liothyronine (T3) therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). For selected patients, however, a trial of T4-T3 combination therapy may have some benefit. A therapeutic trial using separate pills of T4 and T3 is most reasonable in patients who have not felt well since thyroidectomy or ablative therapy with radioiodine, or in patients with hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis who do not feel well and who have serum T3 near or below the lower end of the reference range. We discourage the use of combined therapy in older patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease in whom excessive T3 levels might precipitate an arrhythmia or other adverse cardiovascular events, and in pregnant women.
