The pregnancy heart team should include, at a minimum, a cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist/obstetrician, cardiovascular surgeon, anesthesiologist, and provider with expertise in genetics (genetic counselor or geneticist) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1841657316"><span class="h1">RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2772654126"><span class="h2">Maternal risks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnant patients with HTAD are at risk for cardiovascular (particularly aortic) complications and obstetric complications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3139908205"><span class="h3">Cardiovascular complications</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4079695316"><span class="h4">Aortic complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with HTAD are at increased risk for aortic aneurysm, dissection, and rupture during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Aortic root dilation can also lead to worsening aortic regurgitation. Complications can occur at any time during or after pregnancy, but are most often seen during the third trimester or postpartum period [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>].</p><p>The association between pregnancy-related aortic dissection and HTAD was illustrated by a study of 29 individuals with aortic dissection during or within 12 weeks after pregnancy reported in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) from 1998 to 2018 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Twenty of these individuals (69 percent) had HTAD or a family history of disease of the aorta: 13 with MFS, two with LDS, two with bicuspid aortic valves, two with family history of aortic disease, and one with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In 47 percent of cases, aortopathy was diagnosed only after aortic dissection.</p><p>Most data available about pregnancy-related aortic dissection with HTAD comes from individuals with MFS. There are few data on pregnancy for other HTADs, so the risk of aortic rupture or dissection during pregnancy and postpartum in individuals with these disorders is difficult to quantify.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MFS</strong> – For individuals with MFS, the risk of aortic dissection associated with pregnancy has been estimated as approximately 2 to 4 percent [<a href="#rid4">4,9-13</a>]. In a report from the GenTAC registry of 227 pregnancies in 94 individuals with MFS, the rate of aortic dissection (type A or B) was higher during pregnancy and the postpartum period than during nonpregnancy time periods (5.4 versus 0.6 per 100 person-years; rate ratio 8.4, 95% CI 3.9-18.4) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ACTA2</strong> – While there is much less information for nonsyndromic HTAD, a retrospective study examined the risk associated with 137 pregnancies in 53 individuals with <em>ACTA2</em>, a gene associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Eight patients (6 percent of pregnancies; 20 percent of patients) experienced an acute aortic dissection during the third trimester or postpartum period. One patient had a myocardial infarction prior to aortic dissection. Of note, none of the patients with aortic dissection were diagnosed with <em>ACTA2</em> mutation prior to their dissections, despite a family history of dissection in six patients.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3479477198"><span class="h4">Risk factors for aortic complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data on risk factors for aortic complications come largely from studies of individuals with MFS:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aortic size </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Type A dissection </strong>– Individuals with MFS with an aortic root diameter &gt;40 mm (particularly &gt;45 mm) and/or rapidly increasing aortic root size (≥3 mm per year) are at greater risk of ascending aortic (type A) dissection and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but there is some risk of dissection even with an aortic root diameter &lt;40 mm [<a href="#rid1">1,3,6,13,15-17</a>]. In a review of 36 cases of aortic dissection associated with pregnancy in individuals with MFS, eight cases occurred with an aortic root diameter ≤40 mm [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The risk of dissection or other serious complications such as endocarditis or heart failure during pregnancy has been estimated to be approximately 1 percent in patients with MFS with an aortic root diameter ≤40 mm [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Type B dissection</strong> – Unlike type A dissections, type B aortic dissections are often not associated with significant thoracic aortic dilation, and no predictive factors have been identified to date [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior aortic dissection or aortic root replacement </strong>– Patients with a prior aortic dissection or prophylactic aortic root replacement are considered at high risk for aortic dissection during pregnancy, but there are insufficient data to quantify the risk since only case reports are available in this population of patients [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-term effects of pregnancy</strong> – In addition to the risk of complications during pregnancy, limited data suggest that pregnancy may increase the long-term rate of aortic dilation in patients with MFS. One small study of females with MFS found a higher rate of aortic root growth in those who experienced pregnancy compared with controls that had not been pregnant (0.36 versus 0.14 mm per year) only among those with baseline aortic diameter ≥40 mm [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In a larger study of females with MFS, aortic root size was significantly larger among those who had experienced pregnancy compared with controls who had not been pregnant, although baseline aortic root sizes were similar [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In addition, in a subset of females with echocardiograms prior to, during, and after pregnancy, the rate of aortic root growth increased significantly during pregnancy and declined following delivery, though remaining above the baseline rate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The increased risk of aortic dilation and aortic complications during pregnancy may be due to increased arterial wall stress associated with the hypervolemic and hyperdynamic circulatory state and/or hormonal effects on aortic wall composition [<a href="#rid4">4,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4187681868"><span class="h4">Other cardiovascular complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with MFS are at risk for additional cardiovascular disorders which may pose risks during pregnancy, including mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse, new or worsening arrhythmia, and heart failure due to ventricular dysfunction (such as may be associated with valve disease). The assessment and management of these conditions during pregnancy are discussed separately.

There is also a risk of transmission from affected parent to child. HTADs are generally autosomal dominant conditions with a 50 percent risk of transmission to offspring, with the potential for intrafamilial phenotypic variability. (See <a class="local">'Counseling'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8150.html" rel="external">"Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>MFS</strong> – Limited data are available on fetal and neonatal complications associated with pregnancy in patients with HTAD. A literature review of case reports and series published between 2005 and 2015 included 1112 pregnancies in 852 patients with MFS [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The fetal mortality rate was 5.6 percent and 41 percent of births were cesarean deliveries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a retrospective multicenter study of 111 completed pregnancies among 63 patients with MFS, there was a high rate of premature deliveries (15 percent), mainly due to preterm prelabor rupture of membranes and cervical insufficiency, which resulted in a markedly increased combined rate of fetal and neonatal mortality (7 percent; 5 percent accounted for by preterm prelabor rupture of membranes) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the above-referenced series of 29 pregnancies in 21 patients with MFS, babies born to mothers with MFS were delivered earlier than those born to the control group (median 39 versus 40 weeks of gestation) and were significantly more likely to be small for gestational age (24 percent in the MFS group versus 6 percent in the controls) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].

Most individuals with aortic dissection related to pregnancy have an underlying aortopathy (heritable or nonheritable) but the aortopathy is commonly not recognized until after aortic dissection [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Lack of knowledge of the diagnosis of HTAD prior to pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/448.html" rel="external">"The preconception office visit"</a>.)</p><p>Preconception (or earliest possible) assessment of risk in an individual with HTAD includes a history (including family history of aortic dissection or sudden death attributable to aortic disease) and cardiovascular imaging and may also include prenatal genetic testing, after discussion of the goals as well as potential benefits, limitations, and cost of such testing.

Prenatal diagnostic testing is feasible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in the family.</p><p>However, the severity of disease in a child who inherits a pathogenic variant (eg, in the <em>FBN1</em> gene) is somewhat unpredictable; on average the phenotype of an affected child broadly reflects the severity of disease seen in the affected parent, but extreme intrafamilial clinical variability may occur. Analysis of the gene of interest from cells or tissue obtained during preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) using in vitro fertilization techniques, or with chorionic villus sampling during the first trimester of pregnancy or amniocentesis during the second trimester, can be informative. However, such analyses are time consuming, costly (generally not covered by insurance carriers), and carry a very low but measurable risk to the embryo or fetus. Resources for genetic testing are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Among patients with LDS, the threshold aortic diameter for repair is lower for <em>TGFBR1</em>, <em>TGFBR2</em>, or <em>SMAD3</em> variants than for <em>TGFB2</em>- and <em>TGFB3</em>-related LDS variants because studies have suggested that patients with <em>TGFBR1</em>, <em>TGFBR2</em>, and <em>SMAD3</em> variants have more severe aortopathy with aortic dissection risk at lower aortic diameters [<a href="#rid6">6,31-34</a>].
