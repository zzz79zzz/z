         Symptoms related to anemia can result from decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and, in patients with acute, severe bleeding, the added insult of hypovolemia. Symptoms of anemia such as dyspnea and fatigue may be difficult to distinguish from symptoms of HF. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7133.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnostic approach to anemia in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms from reduced oxygen delivery due to anemia generally occur only with severe anemia, but may occur at less severely reduced hemoglobin levels in patients with HF. Since the extraction of oxygen by tissues can increase from 25 to approximately 60 percent with anemia or hypoperfusion, in individuals with normal hemodynamics, normal oxygen delivery is preserved by extraction alone down to a hemoglobin concentration of approximately 8 g/dL. The hemodynamic effects of chronic anemia were evaluated in a right heart catheterization study [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Normal cardiac hemodynamics were maintained in patients with hemoglobin values as low as 7 g/dL; the cardiac output increased at lower hemoglobin concentrations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In healthy individuals, acute, isovolemic reduction in the hemoglobin concentration induces a variety of compensatory changes including increases in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac index along with enhanced tissue oxygen extraction [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The net effect is that oxygen delivery can be maintained at rest at a hemoglobin concentration as low as 5 g/dL (equivalent to a hematocrit of 15 percent) if intravascular volume is maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with HF, oxygen delivery may be impaired due to reduced cardiac output, and thus symptoms may arise at higher hemoglobin levels in patients with anemia and HF.

         Severe anemia is a rare cause of high-output HF. High-output HF in the setting of anemia is more likely to occur in the setting of impaired cardiac reserve associated with an underlying cardiac abnormality such as valvular heart disease or left ventricular dysfunction. Only severe degrees of anemia (ie, hemoglobin &lt;5 g/dL) can produce HF in the absence of underlying heart disease. (See

         Inflammation may contribute to the anemia seen in chronic HF. This view is supported by the finding of increased levels of circulating cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in patients with HF, and increased levels of the acute phase reactants C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum ferritin [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-13
         </a>
         ]. Such changes are consistent with those found in patients with the anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation (ACD/AI) as well as in some older adults with unexplained anemia. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         While the regulatory peptide hepcidin plays a central role in the anemia of inflammation, its role in the anemia seen in patients with HF is uncertain [

         Individuals with HF may have increased plasma volume that causes a decrease in hemoglobin despite a normal red blood cell mass, referred to as dilutional anemia [
         <a href="#rid16">

         In a report of 37 patients with HF and anemia in whom the plasma volume was directly determined using iodine-131 labeled albumin, 17 had anemia on the basis of hemodilution (ie, an expanded plasma volume) [

        <p>
         In another study in 99 patients with HF, those with anemia had significantly increased plasma volume and no significant reduction in red cell volume, as measured by a chromium-51 assay [

         Iron deficiency may be more common in HF patients than is suggested by iron studies alone since the ferritin level may underestimate iron stores. This has been illustrated in series of patients with HF who have been tested simultaneously with bone marrow iron staining and serum iron studies. As examples:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">

         In a 2018 series of 42 individuals with HF (mean left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 38 percent, mean age 68 years, 76 percent male), 17 (40 percent) had absent bone marrow iron [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Among those with iron deficiency, serum ferritin levels ranged from 44 to 162 ng/mL. Serum iron ≤13 plus TSAT &lt;20 had the best diagnostic performance.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In a 2006 series of 37 patients with advanced HF (mean LVEF 22 percent; mean New York Heart Association class 3.7) and anemia, there was no stainable bone marrow iron (ie, iron deficiency) in 27 (73 percent) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Serum ferritin levels, however, were reduced in only two of the iron deficient patients, indicating that elevated serum ferritin levels do not reliably exclude iron deficiency in this population.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These studies reinforce the importance of evaluating for iron deficiency in individuals with HF and anemia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation of cause of anemia'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether these results reflect the prevalence of iron deficiency in populations with less severe HF is not known. In addition, the benefit of iron replacement was not assessed in these studies. Additional details of testing and treatment are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7150.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The other major cause of microcytic anemia other than iron deficiency is thalassemia. Individuals with thalassemia can develop HF due to iron overload, even if they have not had transfusions. (See

         Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which prolong survival in patients with HF, also appear to induce anemia in selected patients. These drugs also reduce the hematocrit following renal transplantation and have been used to treat erythrocytosis in these patients. (See

         ]. At one year after randomization, the rate of new anemia (hematocrit ≤39 percent in men and ≤36 percent in women) was significantly higher in the enalapril group (11.3 versus 7.9 percent with placebo, adjusted odds ratio 1.56). The difference in hematocrit between the two groups was evident as early as six weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         The effect of ACE inhibitors on hematocrit may be mediated by Ac-SDKP (goralatide), a tetrapeptide that inhibits erythropoiesis. Ac-SDKP is metabolized by ACE and would be expected to accumulate in the presence of an ACE inhibitor, thereby inhibiting erythropoiesis.

         A serum ferritin &lt;41 ng/mL or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt;20 percent is strongly suggestive of iron deficiency in patients with HF. The ferritin threshold is slightly higher than in individuals who lack chronic inflammatory conditions because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. (See

         In patients with HF who do not have symptoms attributable to anemia, we suggest using a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy (reserving transfusion for a lower hemoglobin level rather than transfusing at a higher hemoglobin level). In general, transfusion should be considered when the hemoglobin is ≤7 to 8 g/dL, with the specific threshold matched to the clinical trial population most closely matched by the patient, as summarized in the table  (

        <p>
         Some patients may require transfusion at higher levels if they have symptoms related to anemia such as ischemic chest pain or signs of hemodynamic compromise due to anemia. Transfusion is appropriate when symptoms are severe enough and clearly related to the anemia rather than to HF or another underlying condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Transfusion thresholds in HF are based on low-quality evidence. No large randomized controlled trials have been published on the relative efficacy of a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion threshold specifically in HF (stable or decompensated). A systematic review from 2013 focused on individuals with heart disease identified six trials evaluating transfusion thresholds in other populations that included patients with HF; patient-level meta-analyses did not show a survival benefit from a more liberal transfusion approach (relative risk [RR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.61-1.42) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Additional details regarding the individual trials are presented separately. (See

         When red cell transfusion is required in a patient with HF, careful attention to volume status is recommended, including adjustment of transfusion rate and supplemental diuretics as needed to avoid volume overload. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7919.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is consistent with a systematic review of the literature and practice guideline published by the American College of Physicians (ACP) in 2013 [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. The guideline suggests using a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy (trigger hemoglobin threshold of 7 to 8 g/dL), rather than a more liberal threshold, in hospitalized patients with coronary heart disease. We agree with using a restrictive threshold in most patients with heart disease who lack symptomatic anemia, with individualized transfusion decisions based upon clinical judgment, including assessment of whether the patient appears to have symptoms from anemia rather than the underlying cardiac condition. Links to this and other guidelines are listed below. (See

         For most patients with HF who have iron deficiency, we suggest intravenous iron, typically

        </p>
        <p>
         Once iron stores are repleted, iron supplements should be stopped, as excess iron deposition is cardiotoxic. In patients whose iron deficiency does not improve with oral supplementation, intravenous iron is the next step in management. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation for the cause of iron deficiency should be performed, and any causes of anemia should be appropriately treated to prevent recurrent anemia. (See

         Professional societies suggest that iron replacement is reasonable for patients with HF who are iron deficient, but they differ on the benefits of iron replacement; the American guidelines suggest that iron replacement may improve quality of life, while the European guidelines suggest that iron therapy may reduce hospital admissions [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is based on the notion that patients with a deficiency of key minerals should undergo replacement of that element and evidence that iron supplementation reduces the risk of HF hospitalization in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Trials have not shown a survival or quality-of-life benefit of iron supplementation when compared with placebo. Only patients with HFrEF were included in trials of iron supplementation; the effect of iron supplementation on outcomes in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction is unknown. Intravenous and oral iron have not been directly compared in patients with HF. However, trials that showed beneficial effects of iron replacement have used intravenous iron.

Those assigned to FCM had a median increase in hemoglobin of 0.8 g/dL, compared with 0.3 g/dL in the placebo group. Therapy was well tolerated, with serious adverse events, mostly cardiac, occurring in 45 percent of those assigned to FCM and 51 percent of those assigned to placebo.

         A randomized trial comparing oral iron versus placebo involved 225 individuals with HFrEF (LVEF ≤40 percent) and iron deficiency (ferritin &lt;100 ng/mL or ferritin 100 to 299 ng/mL plus TSAT &lt;20 percent) [

         ]. The mean baseline hemoglobin was 12.6 g/dl. At 16 weeks of observation, there was a slightly greater increase in ferritin level in patients receiving oral iron (18 versus 1 ng/mL). The change in hemoglobin levels was not reported. There was a trend towards an increase in the six-minute walk test that did not reach statistical significance (-13 meters; 95% CI -32 to 6 meters). Limitations included the relatively high baseline hemoglobin level, the small sample size, the short duration of follow up, and the high dropout rate (22 individuals [10 percent]).

         In patients with HF, anemia is associated with increased mortality, although it remains uncertain whether anemia is an independent predictor of outcomes or reflects more advanced disease and more extensive comorbidities. In a meta-analysis from 2021 that included over 50,000 individuals with HF, the odds ratio for mortality in individuals with concomitant anemia was 1.43 (95% CI 1.29-1.84) [
         <a href="#rid40">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of retrospective studies have evaluated the relationship between anemia and mortality in patients with HF [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,7,20,41-52
         </a>
         ]. Three studies found a J-shaped or U-shaped relationship between mortality and hemoglobin, with increased mortality associated with hemoglobin levels &lt;13 to 14 or &gt;15 to 17 g/dL [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51-53
         </a>
         ]. Some studies have suggested that anemia independently predicts worse outcomes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,7
         </a>
         ]. However, the largest observational study that controlled for the greatest number of possible confounding variables found that anemia was not an independent predictor of outcome [

        </p>
        <p>
         The independent prognostic significance of anemia in HF patients was suggested in a review of 1061 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF  (

         On multivariate analysis, a low hemoglobin concentration was an independent predictor of mortality (relative risk 1.13 for each 1 g/dL fall in hemoglobin concentration).

         Similarly, in an analysis from the SOLVD trial, a low hemoglobin concentration was an independent predictor of mortality [

          2
         </a>
         ]. At a mean follow-up of 33 months, each percentage point reduction in hematocrit was associated with a 3 percent increase in mortality. These effects were seen in patients treated with

          enalapril

         or placebo. As noted above, the incidence of anemia was higher in the enalapril-treated group [

          20
         </a>
         ]. (See

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The time course of anemia appears to affect its prognostic significance. In a review of 6159 patients with chronic HF, anemia was present at baseline in 17.2 percent [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. At six-month follow-up, persistent anemia was associated with higher mortality risk than no anemia (58 versus 31 percent), while transient anemia, which was present in almost one-half of anemic patients, conferred no excess mortality risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         These analyses, however, do not establish a causal role for anemia in worse outcomes in HF. Among the possible confounding variables is the possibility that advanced HF exacerbates anemia. If this were the case, anemia would be a marker for advanced disease. Two studies evaluated patients with new onset HF, in whom the anemia would be less likely to be due to the HF. Results from these observational studies were conflicting as to whether anemia is [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] or is not [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ] an independent predictor of outcome. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a larger study, anemia was not an independent predictor of outcomes in over 50,000 HF patients ≥65 years of age who were admitted to the hospital with a principal diagnosis of HF, either new or recurrent [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Although anemia was a significant predictor of one-year mortality, it was also associated with a wide range of possible confounding factors, including cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities, indices of HF severity, age, sex, and nursing-home residence. In a multivariate analysis incorporating these variables, there was no difference in one-year mortality between patients with a normal hematocrit (40 to 44 percent) and those with severe anemia (hematocrit ≤24 percent). The authors suggested that prior studies were limited by exclusion criteria, small sample size, and, most importantly, failure to incorporate the broad range of possible confounders.

          Causes of anemia in HF

         – Anemia is common in patients with heart failure (HF). Multiple factors, including increased levels of circulating cytokines, hemodilution, iron deficiency, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, reduced kidney function, and poor nutrition may be present in an individual patient.

          Iron deficiency
         </strong>
         – A serum ferritin &lt;41 ng/mL or a TSAT &lt;20 percent is strongly suggestive of iron deficiency in patients with HF. For individuals with values above these thresholds for whom there is a strong suspicion of iron deficiency, additional testing such as soluble transferrin receptor may be appropriate. (See

          Transfusion
         </strong>
         – We suggest using a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy (eg, trigger hemoglobin threshold of 7 to 8 g/dL), rather than a more liberal threshold (such as &lt;10 g/dL) in patients with HF (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
