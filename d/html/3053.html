Patients may present with persistent microscopic hematuria or intermittent gross hematuria during an upper respiratory infection, termed "synpharyngitic" to differentiate it from the timing of postinfectious glomerulonephritis that is commonly associated with streptococcal infections. IgA nephropathy can be associated with preserved kidney function, proteinuria, progressive chronic kidney disease, or crescentic glomerulonephritis. If associated with systemic symptoms such as a vasculitic rash involving IgA deposits, arthralgias, or abdominal pain, it is termed IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura). IgA nephropathy is not usually associated with a family history of kidney disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3095.html" rel="external">"IgA nephropathy: Pathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3112.html" rel="external">"IgA nephropathy: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3048322302"><span class="h2">Alport syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alport syndrome (also referred to as hereditary nephritis) is an inherited progressive form of glomerular disease that is often associated with sensorineural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. Alport syndrome is a primary basement membrane disorder arising from variants in genes encoding several members of the collagen IV protein family. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6093.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6086.html" rel="external">"Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)"</a>.)</p><p>The classical presentation of Alport syndrome is based upon clinical manifestations of affected males with X-linked disease. These features include glomerular disease that progresses to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), ocular abnormalities (eg, anterior lenticonus), sensorineural hearing loss, and a positive family history of kidney failure and hearing loss. However, it is not unusual for male patients with Alport syndrome, including adults, to present with isolated hematuria. Although patients with autosomal recessive disease presenting in adulthood will often exhibit chronic kidney disease and extrarenal features, they may also present with isolated hematuria. Females with X-linked disease and patients with autosomal dominant disease have a more varied course, ranging from isolated microscopic hematuria to progressive kidney failure, and hearing loss and ocular abnormalities may also be present [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2284683736"><span class="h2">Thin basement membrane nephropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TBMN (also called thin basement membrane disease) is considered a relatively common disorder. In most patients, the only abnormal finding on kidney biopsy is diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membranes (GBMs) requiring electron microscopy (EM) for the diagnosis. Historically, these patients were often described as having benign familial hematuria; however, because of the increased risk of developing kidney failure, this terminology is not favored and should no longer be used. Some patients given a diagnosis of TBMN also exhibit a focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) lesion on the kidney biopsy.</p><p>TBMN is often familial, with a family history of hematuria being noted in 30 to 50 percent of cases. TBMN seems to account for most cases of what has been called benign familial hematuria. Numerous heterozygous variants in the collagen IV genes <em>COL4A3</em> and <em>COL4A4</em>, as well as hemizygous and heterozygous variants in <em>COL4A5, </em>have been identified in patients with so-called TBMN. Although variants in these genes are not identified in all patients given a diagnosis of TBMN, no other loci for this condition have been identified. Some clinicians, including the authors of this topic, consider hematuria and thin GBM associated with <em>COL4A3</em>/<em>COL4A4</em> variants to be autosomal dominant Alport syndrome and use the term "hematuria with thin glomerular basement membranes" for patients in whom mutations in collagen IV genes cannot be identified. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3038.html" rel="external">"Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1515182596"><span class="h2">Less common causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although mild postinfectious glomerulonephritis can also lead to isolated glomerular hematuria, there is usually rapid resolution of the urinary abnormalities within three to six months in this setting. In addition, C3 glomerulopathy occasionally produces isolated hematuria although decreased glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria is usually present and C3 levels may be normal or low. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6118.html" rel="external">"Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3090.html" rel="external">"C3 glomerulopathies: Dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1048271466"><span class="h1">CONFIRMATION OF ISOLATED AND PERSISTENT GLOMERULAR HEMATURIA</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H940192239"><span class="h2">Exclusion of nonglomerular hematuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria, it is important to exclude nonglomerular causes of hematuria as part of the evaluation. Such workup may include imaging of the upper and lower urinary tract and cystoscopy. Patients with evidence of glomerular hematuria by urine microscopy (eg, red blood cell [RBC] casts, dysmorphic appearance of some RBCs) may <strong>not</strong> need to be evaluated for potentially serious urologic disease unless the patient has clinical risk factors for a urologic cause of microscopic hematuria [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. In patients with normomorphic RBCs in the urinary sediment or for whom reliable examination of the urinary sediment (ie, by a nephrologist or other experienced examiner) is not available, urologic causes of hematuria must be considered.

If such tests have not yet been performed or if the results are not available, we obtain these tests to confirm that the patient has isolated hematuria. Patients with a urine albumin excretion above 30 mg/day and/or an elevated serum creatinine level should not be considered to have isolated hematuria and should be evaluated for glomerular disease.

Thus, clinicians should clearly discuss the benefits and risks of kidney biopsy with their patients and provide patients with the option of conservative management and pursuing kidney biopsy only if they show signs of progressive kidney disease (eg, proteinuria, hypertension, deterioration in kidney function). However, as mentioned above, a kidney biopsy is indicated if the patient is being actively evaluated as a potential living donor for kidney transplantation. (See <a class="local">'Establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>If a kidney biopsy is performed, the biopsy specimen should be analyzed by light microscopy (LM), immunofluorescence (IF), and electron microscopy (EM). IF is required to establish a diagnosis of IgA nephropathy, C3 glomerulopathy, or lupus nephritis.

If EM is not available, the utility of the kidney biopsy in establishing a diagnosis for isolated and persistent glomerular hematuria is limited. In such cases, immunostaining for the alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains of collagen IV may be informative; however, the sensitivity of collagen IV staining for the diagnosis of Alport syndrome varies depending upon the age at diagnosis, sex, and mode of inheritance  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118692" href="/z/d/graphic/118692.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>].
