They account for 0.5 to 3 percent of all functioning pituitary tumors [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and much less than 1 percent of all cases of hyperthyroidism. The incidence in Sweden is calculated to be 2.8 per 1 million, in which 0.85 per million had disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Nevertheless, the diagnosis should be considered in all hyperthyroid patients, especially those with a diffuse goiter and no extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of TSH-secreting pituitary tumors. Other causes of hyperthyroidism are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7871.html" rel="external">"Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7847.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TSH-secreting adenomas secrete biologically active TSH in a more or less autonomous fashion. Thus, TSH secretion usually does not increase much in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and does not decrease much in response to exogenous thyroid hormone administration. The biological activity of the TSH that is secreted varies considerably; as a result, serum immunoreactive TSH concentrations range from normal (albeit inappropriately high in the presence of hyperthyroidism) to markedly elevated (&gt;500 mU/L) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Most TSH-secreting adenomas secrete only TSH. However, approximately 20 to 30 percent of the adenomas secrete one or more other pituitary hormones, predominantly growth hormone or prolactin [<a href="#rid2">2,4</a>]. There have been no reported instances of cosecretion of corticotropin (ACTH) and TSH.</p><p>Adenomas secreting TSH and growth hormone are equally common in males and females, whereas cosecretion of TSH and prolactin is approximately five times more common in females than in males. Hyperprolactinemia is not always due to tumor secretion of prolactin; in some patients, it is caused by compression of the pituitary stalk and interruption of tonic hypothalamic inhibition of prolactin secretion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6626.html" rel="external">"Causes of hyperprolactinemia", section on 'Decreased dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin secretion'</a>.)</p><p>The molecular basis of TSH-secreting adenomas is not known. While somatic mutations or abnormal oncogene expression could contribute to these tumors as in the case of other pituitary tumors, no such mutations have been uniformly described. The absence of negative feedback regulation of thyroid hormone on TSH suggests impairment of the thyroid hormone receptor beta 1 (<em>THRB1</em>) or beta 2 (<em>THRB2</em>) gene. In the TSH-secreting adenomas that are plurihormonal, an isolated thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) abnormality would not be the etiology. Furthermore, the relationship between tumor growth and hormone secretion is unclear. However, molecular analysis of TSH-secreting adenomas has shown:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overexpression of the pituitary-specific transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) in 14 patients [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Somatic mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (<em>THRB</em>) gene in two of six TSH-secreting adenomas [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. In the latter, the mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta protein (TR-beta) did not bind thyroid hormone and interfered with the function of the normal TR-beta, thus providing an explanation for the nonsuppressible nature of at least some of the adenomas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased expression of TR-beta and TR-alpha in two TSH-secreting adenomas [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] and decreased expression of the corepressor NCOR2 in a single case [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] have been reported.</p><p></p><p>Activating mutations in the TRH-receptor gene have not been identified [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1439741"><span class="h2">Symptoms and signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients have the typical symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism (eg, palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance), but a few patients have mild or even no hyperthyroid symptoms [<a href="#rid4">4,13,14</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7833.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults"</a>). In addition, patients may have symptoms related to the expanding tumor mass with compression of the normal pituitary gland or the optic chiasm or from cosecretion of growth hormone or prolactin.</p><p>In two separate reviews of patients with TSH-secreting tumors, clinical features other than hyperthyroidism included [<a href="#rid3">3,4,15</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A diffuse goiter – 56 to 93 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Visual field defects – 25 to 35 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Menstrual disturbances – 33 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Galactorrhea (women), with or without cosecretion of prolactin – 28 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Headache – 21 percent</p><p></p><p>In cases of mixed TSH/growth hormone-secreting tumors, symptoms of acromegaly may also occur, including macroglossia, deepening of the voice, carpal tunnel syndrome, and hyperhidrosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6633.html" rel="external">"Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly"</a>.)</p><p>In a case series from a single institution in Italy of 62 patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, three patients had coexisting differentiated thyroid cancer [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], and in an earlier literature review, nine patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas were found to have differentiated thyroid cancer [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. This finding may possibly be due to long-term TSH stimulation. In most cases, differentiated thyroid cancer was diagnosed and thyroidectomy performed before the diagnosis of a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma was appreciated.</p><p>The characteristic signs of Graves' ophthalmopathy (proptosis and periorbital edema) are absent, unless there is coexisting Graves' disease [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p>In two series, the mean age at presentation was 41 to 45 years and equal incidence in males and females [<a href="#rid3">3,20</a>]. In contrast, Graves' disease and most other causes of hyperthyroidism are much more common in women. Additional reports of Graves' disease concurrent with a TSH-secreting adenoma [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>] may reflect presence of a common disease with a rare disease. The time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of the pituitary tumor has ranged from 1 to 27 years. Most of the longstanding cases erroneously received ablative thyroid treatment at least once and often several times before their adenomas were correctly diagnosed. In such cases, patients whose thyroid glands were ablated may present as having high serum TSH levels that do not respond to escalating doses of T4 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a>) replacement.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12895446"><span class="h2">Thyroid function tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The characteristic biochemical abnormalities in patients with hyperthyroidism caused by a TSH-secreting adenoma are normal or high serum TSH concentrations and high serum total and free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations.</p><p>Among 255 reviewed patients [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], the ranges of hormone values were:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum TSH concentrations – &lt;1.0 to 568 mU/L</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum total T4 concentrations – 11.6 to 53 micrograms/dL (150 to 678 nmol/L)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum free T4 concentrations – 1.6 to 7.7 ng/dL (20 to 100 pmol/L)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum total T3 concentrations – 195 to 1300 ng/dL (3 to 20 nmol/L)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum free T3 concentrations – 5 to 26 pg/mL (8.0 to 40.2 pmol/L)</p><p></p><p>Approximately 30 percent of patients who had not had any thyroid ablation therapy in the past had serum TSH values within the normal range; however, "normal" values are inappropriately high in the presence of high serum T4 and T3 concentrations. Frequent measurements of serum TSH in four patients demonstrated loss of the normal nocturnal surge in TSH secretion, a finding that is compatible with autonomous TSH secretion [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Serum TSH concentrations do not increase in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the majority of patients [<a href="#rid3">3,24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12895453"><span class="h2">Alpha subunit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 50 to 85 percent of patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas (particularly macroadenomas) have a high serum concentration of the alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones [<a href="#rid3">3,14</a>]. The relative increase in serum alpha subunit is greater than that of serum TSH, resulting in a high molar ratio of serum alpha subunit to TSH (mean 3.2) [<a href="#rid3">3,24</a>].</p><p>The ratio is calculated using the following formula:</p><p>[Alpha subunit (in micrograms/L) ÷ TSH (in mU/L)] x 10</p><p>In postmenopausal women, who have normally elevated serum alpha-subunit levels accompanying their high serum gonadotropin levels, the cutoff which suggests a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma is higher than in premenopausal and male patients (as high as 29.1 compared with 0.3 in men) [<a href="#rid2">2,25</a>]. The ratio can be normal in patients with microadenomas [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Imaging studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The thyroid appearance on ultrasound and radioiodine imaging is similar to that in Graves' disease (diffuse homogeneous enlargement, normal or high radioiodine uptake, increased color Doppler flow).</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary more often shows a macroadenoma than a microadenoma, and some are locally invasive [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In one series of 18 patients, the mean macroadenoma size was 3.1 cm [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>Indium-0111 <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9714" href="/z/d/drug information/9714.html" rel="external">octreotide</a> scintigraphy may show focal uptake in the pituitary [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1439747"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma should be suspected in hyperthyroid patients with diffuse goiter and no extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease, who have high serum free T4 and T3 concentrations and unsuppressed (normal or high) serum TSH concentrations, particularly in the presence of headache or clinical features of concomitant hypersecretion of other pituitary hormones (eg, symptoms of acromegaly). The subsequent finding of a pituitary macroadenoma by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very strong evidence that the patient has a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, particularly in the presence of an elevated alpha subunit. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13606474"><span class="h3">Assay interference</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other conditions to be distinguished from TSH-secreting adenomas are those in which there is methodological interference in the measurement of total T4, total T3, or TSH. Serum total T4 and total T3 concentrations may be increased because of increased protein binding of the hormones in serum. These conditions include elevations in serum T4-binding globulin concentrations, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (in which an abnormal albumin with increased affinity for T4 is produced), and the presence of anti-T4 antibodies. Patients with these conditions are euthyroid and have normal serum TSH concentrations, elevated total T4, and elevated total T3 but usually normal serum free T4 and free T3 concentrations when measured by appropriate methods. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7892.html" rel="external">"Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia"</a>.)</p><p>The presence of heterophilic antibodies can interfere with TSH measurements in immunometric assays. These human anti-mouse gamma globulins can bridge the two mouse monoclonal antibodies (solid phase antibody and signal antibody) and cause spuriously elevated readings for TSH [<a href="#rid19">19,28</a>]. Nonlinearity of TSH measurements with serial dilution of the patient's serum strongly suggests assay interference. Addition of nonimmune homologous mouse immunoglobulins has reduced this type of assay interference. Commercial assays exist for detecting human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).</p><p>In addition, autoantibodies to TSH have also been described which create TSH-anti-TSH immunoglobulin G (IgG) complexes (also called macro-TSH), which lack biologic activity but may be immunoreactive and cause spuriously high TSH values (often &gt;100 mU/L) [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>]. Autoantibodies to TSH can be detected by removal of the IgG-TSH complexes with polyethylene glycol or protein A or G, then repeating the assay on the immunosubtracted sera.</p><p>Patients with substances interfering with TSH measurements are usually euthyroid, not thyrotoxic, and have normal free T4 and T3. Thus, tests for interference with the TSH measurement are rarely required.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1440208"><span class="h3">Resistance to thyroid hormone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with TSH-secreting adenomas and hyperthyroidism must be distinguished from those with the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone due to mutations in the <em>THRB</em> gene (RTH-beta). Patients with RTH-beta have variable tissue hyporesponsiveness to thyroid hormone due to a defect in the <em>THRB</em> gene [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Despite their RTH in many tissues (including the pituitary gland), some patients with RTH-beta have symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism, particularly tachycardia, hyperactivity, and hyperreflexia, and many have goiter. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5827.html" rel="external">"Resistance to thyroid hormone and other defects in thyroid hormone action", section on 'Resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTH-beta and nonTR-RTH)'</a>.)</p><p>The following findings help to distinguish TSH-secreting adenomas from RTH-beta:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A mutation in the <em>THRB</em> gene is present in patients with RTH-beta but usually not in patients with TSH-secreting adenomas. There is one reported patient with RTH-beta and a TSH-secreting adenoma [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. There is also a reported patient with RTH-beta and an "incidental" pituitary adenoma not secreting TSH [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The serum alpha-subunit concentration is normal in RTH-beta but, as noted above, often high in patients with TSH-secreting adenomas. (See <a class="local">'Alpha subunit'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentration is high in patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas, whereas the values are normal in RTH-beta. This difference reflects the expected action of excess T4 and T3 on hepatic SHBG production in hyperthyroidism and resistance to the hormones' action in RTH-beta.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The serum TSH concentration increases in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in patients with RTH-beta but not in most patients with TSH-secreting adenomas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with RTH-beta are more likely to have a fall in serum TSH concentrations in response to administered T3 (90 versus 12 to 25 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with RTH-beta are more likely to have a decrease in the velocity of TSH suppression two hours after subcutaneous injection of a short-term somatostatin analog [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. </p><p></p><p>The use of color flow Doppler sonography of the thyroid gland has also been shown to distinguish between patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas and those with RTH-beta [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. After a standard T3 suppression test, used for the diagnosis of RTH-beta (50 micrograms/day for days 1 to 3, followed by 100 micrograms/day for days 4 to 6, and then 200 micrograms/day for days 7 to 9) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>], the increased color flow Doppler sonography pattern and peak systolic velocity normalized in 8 of 10 patients with RTH-beta but not in any of the eight patients with a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.</p><p>Incidental pituitary adenomas may occur in patients with RTH-beta due to <em>THRB</em> gene mutations. There is no evidence to suggest that <em>THRB </em>gene mutations cause pituitary adenomas, but the relatively common occurrence of incidental pituitary adenomas, when they do occur in patients with <em>THRB </em>gene mutations, can make it difficult to distinguish one from the other.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1440220"><span class="h3">Longstanding primary hypothyroidism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An occasional patient with longstanding primary hypothyroidism has sufficient hyperplasia of the thyrotroph cells to cause pituitary enlargement [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The hyperplasia may be mistaken for a pituitary tumor, but the patients have clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism, low serum T4 and T3 concentrations, and very high serum TSH concentrations. These patients should not be confused with patients with TSH-secreting adenomas. The enlarged pituitary in hypothyroidism shrinks with T4 therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7886.html" rel="external">"Disorders that cause hypothyroidism"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13607112"><span class="h2">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma should be suspected in a hyperthyroid patient with high serum free T4 and T3 concentrations and unsuppressed (normal or high) serum TSH concentration.

Dopamine agonists are an alternative option for those who do not tolerate somatostatin analogs, particularly in patients with cosecretion of prolactin. (See <a class="local">'Restore euthyroidism prior to neurosurgery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A beta blocker such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9829" href="/z/d/drug information/9829.html" rel="external">propranolol</a> (80 to 160 mg daily) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/z/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">atenolol</a> (25 to 50 mg daily) can be given to ameliorate some of the symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Long-term antithyroid drug therapy or thyroid ablation with radioiodine or surgery is <strong>not</strong> indicated in patients with TSH-secreting adenomas, because sustained reductions in thyroid hormone secretion would be expected to increase TSH secretion and stimulate tumor growth. However, if euthyroidism cannot be achieved with somatostatin analogs or dopamine agonists, short-term administration of a thionamide is necessary to restore euthyroidism prior to neurosurgery. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7874.html" rel="external">"Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7858.html" rel="external">"Nonthyroid surgery in the patient with thyroid disease", section on 'Hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Criteria for cure</strong> – There are no well-established criteria for cure after transsphenoidal surgery. The parameters that should be taken into account when assessing for cure include clinical remission of symptoms of hyperthyroidism, normalization of thyroid function tests, and absence of residual tumor on MRI. (See <a class="local">'Criteria for cure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Residual disease</strong> – For patients with residual disease after transsphenoidal surgery, we prefer to treat with somatostatin analogs rather than pituitary irradiation due to the more immediate response with medication. The choice between long-term somatostatin analogs and pituitary radiation is based upon discussion with the individual patient about the risks and benefits of each therapy. (See <a class="local">'Residual disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Ónnestam L, Berinder K, Burman P, et al.
