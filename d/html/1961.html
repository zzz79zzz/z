          Hypertension
         </strong>
         – Control of hypertension is a key intervention in preventing and managing HF in dialysis patients. The management of hypertension in dialysis patients includes achieving and maintaining euvolemia as much as possible during the interdialytic interval as well as treatment with antihypertensive agents appropriate for patients with advanced kidney disease. In addition, patients with HF and hypertension who receive dialysis should preferentially receive antihypertensive medications that are beneficial for the treatment of HF. (See

         – The treatment of coronary artery disease is aimed at relieving symptoms and improving outcomes. Management options include pharmacologic therapy (antithrombotic therapy, antianginal therapy, and treatment of anemia, hypertension, and other cardiovascular risk factors) and revascularization (percutaneous or surgical). In some cases, revascularization of obstructive coronary artery disease may improve systolic and diastolic ventricular function. Management of coronary heart disease in this group of patients is discussed separately. (See

         Patients with HF who receive dialysis should be monitored with a regular review of symptoms, physical examination, and a review of medications with a focus on any agents that require adjustment to avoid toxicity in the presence of decreased kidney function. The frequency of monitoring by clinicians is individualized based on factors such as clinical stability and duration of HF. Care should be taken to avoid drugs that may cause worsening HF. (See

         Patients on dialysis with HF should be counseled on daily monitoring of weights (considering pre- and postdialysis fluctuations), edema, and symptoms; medication management; exercise as tolerated; and diet.

         The preferred dialysis modality is determined by patient preference and a variety of clinical and socioeconomic factors; the presence of HF does not require a specific dialysis modality. Patients with end-stage kidney disease and HF should be evaluated for each type of dialysis (ie, peritoneal dialysis [PD], in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis). (See

         Advantages and disadvantages of each type of dialysis from the HF standpoint include the following:

          Peritoneal dialysis
         </strong>
         – PD avoids the risks of high-output HF associated with arteriovenous fistula and allows for slower rates but longer durations of fluid removal. Therefore, the desirable body fluid volume target can often be attained in patients at risk of hypotension. Except for patients who have lost their peritoneal ultrafiltration properties, PD does not have disadvantages from the HF management standpoint. The details of PD are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1844.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          In-center or home hemodialysis
         </strong>
         – In-center hemodialysis allows for frequent in-person monitoring by the health care team. However, this modality typically involves relatively short (3.5- to 4-hour) thrice weekly sessions during which volume is removed relatively quickly compared with other forms of dialysis. In patients with HF who receive medications with vasodilatory effects or beta blockers that inhibit compensatory tachycardia, this type of dialysis may increase the risk of hypotension. In this population, such hypotensive episodes can be difficult to manage and may result in interrupted sessions with incomplete dialysis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Compared with conventional in-center dialysis, in-center nocturnal hemodialysis (six to eight hours thrice weekly) and home hemodialysis (four to six times per week) typically allow for slower rates of fluid removal due to increased dialysis time. As such, these modalities may lower the risk of intradialytic hypotension and permit greater fluid removal. (See

          Hemodialysis access
         </strong>
         – In patients with HF, there is also an increased risk with the surgery required to create a dialysis fistula, and high-flow shunting of blood through an arteriovenous fistula sometimes produces high-output HF. However, the infection risks of catheter-based dialysis are high. The approach to hemodialysis access in patients with HF is discussed separately. (See

          Assessment and maintenance of optimal volume status
         </strong>
         – In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who receive dialysis, we rely on physical examination (eg, jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, heart sounds, rales) and weight to establish and maintain volume status. In patients with HFrEF who receive dialysis, the ideal weight is likely to change over time due to multiple factors (eg, cardiac cachexia, changes in cardiac performance) and filling pressures are unlikely to be normal.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients in whom physical examination and weight are poor indicators of volume status (eg, difficult to assess, discrepant findings), echocardiography can help to determine volume status and identify changes in cardiac structure or function. If volume status remains uncertain after noninvasive assessment, we suggest referral to a cardiologist to evaluate the risks and benefits of invasive hemodynamic assessment. Although bioimpedance and bedside lung ultrasound are options for volume assessment, the clinical utility of these tests is uncertain. (See

          Hemodialysis regimen
         </strong>
         – In patients with HF, major barriers to achieving the optimal dry weight are symptoms of hypotension or intravascular hypovolemia such as intradialytic cramping, nausea, or vomiting. These adverse sequelae of fluid removal are ideally mitigated by slowing the rate of ultrafiltration by increasing hemodialysis duration and/or frequency.

         Compared with conventional thrice-weekly dialysis, longer duration and/or more frequent (eg, daily) hemodialysis is likely to provide better volume control and minimize intradialytic hypotension and interdialytic hypervolemia. However, most dialysis units have relatively little flexibility in their schedules for longer or more frequent hemodialysis sessions, the availability of in-center nocturnal dialysis is limited in many regions, and many patients are reluctant to accept recommendations for additional in-center treatment time.

         For patients with HFrEF on dialysis, we suggest therapy with a beta blocker and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor (ie, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB], angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [ARNI]) rather than no therapy or other pharmacologic regimens. In such patients, we suggest avoiding mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy.

        <p>
         We typically start beta blocker therapy with

         succinate is a reasonable alternative for patients in whom hypotension limits achievement of the target weight.
        </p>
        <p>
         If beta blocker therapy is tolerated, we add a low-dose ACE inhibitor, ARB, or

        </p>
        <p>
         Thereafter, the beta blocker and RAAS inhibitor can be increased in a fashion that achieves the highest tolerated dose of both drugs while avoiding hypotension or hyperkalemia. After the first dose or an increase in dose of a RAAS inhibitor, we evaluate for hyperkalemia within one week.

         – The management of patients with persistent hyperkalemia (eg, predialysis serum potassium concentration of 5.5 mEq/L or higher) despite usual modifications of the dialysis prescription and dietary potassium restriction includes dose reduction or discontinuation of RAAS inhibitor therapy.

While some contributors to this topic favor a strategy of RAAS inhibitor discontinuation in patients who are hyperkalemic, other contributors may treat hyperkalemia to allow for continuation of a RAAS inhibitor if the benefit of RAAS inhibitor therapy is judged to exceed the risks. There are no high-quality studies to guide the approach to therapy in this population.

         Our rationale for the use of RAAS inhibitors and beta blockers in patients with HFrEF who receive dialysis is primarily based on indirect evidence and our experience with the safety of these agents in this population. The indirect evidence of efficacy is from patients with HFrEF who do not receive dialysis; patients with HFrEF who receive dialysis are routinely excluded from trials of HFrEF pharmacotherapy.

        <p>
         Though there is indirect evidence to suggest that patients with HFrEF who receive dialysis may benefit from MRA or SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, we do not add MRA therapy to existing RAAS inhibitor therapy due to the higher risk of hyperkalemia, and we do not add SGLT2 inhibitor therapy due to unproven safety in this population. The evidence on the efficacy of these agents in patients with HFrEF who do not receive dialysis is discussed separately. (See

         Patients with HFpEF on dialysis should receive monitoring and optimization of volume status and should receive treatment for conditions commonly associated with HFpEF (eg, hypertension, obesity), as described elsewhere. (See

         There is no specific pharmacologic regimen to treat HFpEF in patient on dialysis. In patients with HFpEF who receive dialysis, we suggest not treating with an MRA or an SGLT2 inhibitor.

         Agents typically used to treat patients with HFpEF (eg, MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors) are potentially unsafe for use in patients on dialysis. The evidence that describes the efficacy of specific treatments for HFpEF in patients with dialysis is composed of retrospective studies prone to bias [

         Patients with severe refractory HF symptoms despite optimal management who are expected to receive long-term dialysis may be candidates for combined heart-kidney transplantation. In such patients, every effort should be made to exclude and treat any reversible causes of cardiac or renal dysfunction. The evaluation for kidney and heart transplantation are discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         In practice, most patients with refractory HF who receive dialysis appropriately undergo combined heart-kidney transplantation to mitigate the risks of kidney allograft loss in patients with HFrEF and to mitigate the risks of ongoing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients who undergo isolated heart transplantation. However, in highly selected patients, isolated kidney transplantation may result in improved LV systolic function and improved survival. The broad use of isolated kidney transplantation in patients with HFrEF is limited by the absence of criteria that reliably predict a favorable outcome. Studies that describe this approach are older and included relatively few patients:

         This was illustrated by a study of over 100 dialysis patients with HFrEF who underwent kidney transplantation between 1998 and 2002 [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. In this cohort of patients, there were no perioperative deaths, mean LVEF increased from 32 to 52 percent at 12 months, and more than two-thirds of patients achieved an LVEF of greater than 50 percent. Patients with normalized LVEF had significantly improved New York Heart Association class and lower risk of death or hospitalization for HF. However, patients with ejection fractions less than 30 percent did not typically normalize.

         Kidney transplantation may also have a beneficial effect on cardiac remodeling as it is associated with regression of LV hypertrophy (LVH) [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23-25
         </a>
         ]. As an example, one prospective study of 24 dialysis patients evaluated changes in LV mass by echocardiography at 3, 6, and 12 months posttransplantation [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. There was a significant decrease in blood pressure at 12 months, and the incidence of LVH decreased from 75 to 52 percent. There was also a significant decrease in LV dilation, and systolic dysfunction normalized in all patients after 12 months. It is unclear if removing the uremic milieu, improving blood pressure, or both were significant factors underlying these changes.

          Prevention

         – Management of risk factors for ventricular dysfunction and the choice of dialysis modality may reduce the likelihood of heart failure (HF) in patients who receive dialysis. (See

          Dialysis modality

         – We generally do not select a dialysis modality based solely on the presence or absence of HF. Each modality (ie, peritoneal dialysis [PD], in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis) has advantages and disadvantages from the HF standpoint. (See

          Dialysis prescription
         </strong>
         – Achieving adequate volume control for patients on dialysis with HF requires accurate assessment of volume status and an optimal dialysis prescription. For patients on hemodialysis with HF, a major barrier to achieving the target dry weight is intradialytic hypotension. This may be mitigated by minimizing interdialytic fluid accumulation and by slowing the rate of ultrafiltration by increasing dialysis duration and/or frequency. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Dialysis prescription'

          Diuretic therapy

         – In dialysis patients with HF who have significant urine output, loop diuretic therapy is helpful to increase urine output and sodium excretion and decrease the need for volume removal with dialysis. (See

          Pharmacologic therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients with HFrEF on dialysis, we suggest therapy with a beta blocker and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor (ie, angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB], angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [ARNI]) rather than no therapy or other pharmacologic regimens (

         In such patients, we suggest avoiding mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy (
