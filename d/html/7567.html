         Prostate cancer is common and is among the main causes of cancer-related death. At the same time, in many cases, prostate cancer grows so slowly that it does not impact survival; hence, routine screening is controversial.

         This topic reviews the efficacy of screening and recommendations regarding screening for prostate cancer.

         <strong>
          Incidence
         </strong>
         – Worldwide, there are an estimated 1,400,000 new cases of prostate cancer annually, making it the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in males [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Among males in the United States, it is the leading cause of cancer, accounting for 29 percent of cancer diagnoses [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data indicate that between 2010 and 2015, the overall incidence of prostate cancer in the United States decreased, particularly for low-risk disease, while the incidence of metastatic disease (per 100,000) increased from 6.2 to 7.1 in males aged 50 to 74 and from 16.8 to 22.6 in males ≥75 years [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The declining incidence rate for low-risk disease was temporally associated with decreased prostate cancer screening following the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation against prostate cancer screening [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, data from the US Cancer Statistics Public Use Research Database spanning 2005 to 2016 showed that the declining rate of low-risk disease had stabilized for males ≥75 years, and rates of regional-stage (annual percent change of 11.1) and distant-stage (annual percent change of 5.0) disease increased for males aged &gt;50 years [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Similarly, analysis of SEER data from 2004 to 2018 also demonstrates an increase in the incidence of metastatic cancer. Among males 45 to 74 years of age, the incidence rate was stable during 2004 to 2010 and then increased significantly during 2010 to 2018 (annual percentage change 5.3 percent). In males aged 75 years or older, the incidence rate decreased from 2004 to 2011 and then increased from 2011 to 2018 (annual percentage change 6.5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Analyses of longer-term data will be needed to determine whether changes in screening practices were associated with increased prostate cancer mortality rates. In 2018, the USPSTF issued a C recommendation for screening males ages 55 to 69, which may again alter screening practices and impact cancer incidence [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].

         <strong>
          Natural history
         </strong>
         – Without screening, many cases of prostate cancer do not ever become clinically evident. Data suggest that prostate cancer often grows so slowly that most males die of other causes before the disease becomes clinically advanced [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ]. At autopsy of males who died of other causes, prostate cancer detection rates (approximately 30 percent for males in their fifties and up to 70 percent for males in their seventies), are higher than the lifetime incidence of diagnosed prostate cancer in the population [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Prostate cancer survival is related to many factors, especially the extent of tumor at the time of diagnosis. The five-year relative survival among males with cancer confined to the prostate (localized) or with regional spread is 100 percent, compared with 31 percent among those diagnosed with distant metastases [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. While males with distant-stage disease may benefit from palliative treatment, their cancers are generally not curable.

          Declining mortality rates
         </strong>
         – Prostate cancer mortality rates have declined in the United States between 1992 and 2017, decreasing from 39 to 19 per 100,000 persons  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75684" href="/z/d/graphic/75684.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Simulation models suggest that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening could account for 45 to 70 percent of the decline, mainly by decreasing the incidence of distant-stage disease [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Other factors that may explain the decline in mortality rates include advances in treatments for males with localized prostate cancer as well as for those with distant-stage disease. For example, the use of androgen deprivation therapy or other chemotherapies could allow males with advanced-stage disease to live long enough to die from a concomitant condition, rather than from prostate cancer.

         For prostate cancer screening to be valuable, it must reduce disease-specific morbidity and/or mortality by detecting cancer at an early stage. However, detection at an early stage does not necessarily correlate with a clinically beneficial outcome (eg, decline in morbidity or mortality due to prostate cancer). Increased detection of prostate cancer subjects some patients to the risks associated with treatments that may not prolong life and that have risks of morbidity.

         </span>
         Screening increases the detection of prostate cancer among males. In a meta-analysis of four randomized trials including 675,232 participants, cancer was diagnosed more often in males who were screened (incidence rate ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.48) compared with the control group [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Prostate cancer incidence in the United States increased sharply during the initial years following the advent of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Incidence rates were stable between 1996 and 2000, then began declining in 2000, reaching a nadir in 2014 (temporally associated with the 2012 USPSTF recommendation against screening) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,15
         </a>
         ]. Rates have been increasing since then  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75684" href="/z/d/graphic/75684.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid12">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening may reduce the risk for distant-stage prostate cancer. In the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), which enrolled 162,243 males ages 50 to 69 years, at a median follow-up of 12 years, the cumulative incidence rate of metastatic disease among those who were in the regular screening group was 0.67 percent compared with the incidence rate in the control group of 0.86 percent [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The relative reduction of metastatic disease was 30 percent in the intention to screen group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70; 95% CI 0.60-0.82), with a relative reduction of 42 percent for males actually screened. The absolute risk reduction of metastatic disease was 3.1 per 1000 males randomized [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Due to the long natural history of prostate cancer, the benefits of screening may become more pronounced with longer follow-up. An update of the ERSPC trial published in 2019 showed a reduction in the number of cases needed to diagnose to prevent one prostate cancer death reduce from 48 at 9 years to 18 at 16 years of follow-up [
         <a href="#rid17">

         </a>
         ].

         While prostate cancer mortality rates have declined since the advent of PSA testing, it is uncertain what proportion of this is due to PSA screening. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology and natural history'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The best available evidence from randomized trials found that screening has at most a small benefit in reducing prostate cancer mortality. Screening has no benefit in reducing overall mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials with follow-up periods ranging from 10 to 20 years, a prostate cancer mortality reduction was not found (relative risk [RR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.08). Participants were randomized to control groups or to one-time or repeat screening that occurred at intervals ranging from one to four years [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, the included studies each contained high or unclear risks of bias. The ERSPC trial found a small absolute survival benefit with PSA screening at nine years of follow-up, with an absolute risk reduction of 0.51 per 1000 males. By 16 years, the prostate cancer mortality rate in the screening group was 0.53 per 1000 person-years compared with 0.66 per 1000 person-years in the control group [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. The absolute risk reduction of prostate cancer death was 1.76 per 1000 males, meaning that to avert one prostate cancer death, 570 males needed to be invited to screening, of whom 18 were expected to be diagnosed with cancer. While this trial was assessed to have the lowest risk of bias of those included in the meta-analysis, the risk of bias was unclear due to allocation concealment and completeness of outcome data. Another large trial included in the meta-analysis, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which enrolled 76,774 males ages 55 to 74 years, did not report a mortality benefit; however, the negative results have been largely discounted because over 40 percent of study subjects had undergone PSA testing within three years before enrolling in the trial [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ], and a subgroup analysis estimated that more than 80 percent of control subjects underwent PSA testing during the study [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Over 80 percent of patients randomized to the control group had screening as part of usual care [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Calculations that take into account not only years of survival, but also the value of each potential benefit and harm associated with screening, suggest that screening does not clearly improve quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), even if mortality is reduced. In a simulation modeling study that used ERSPC data, annual screening between ages 55 and 69 years was projected to result in nine fewer prostate cancer deaths per 1000 males followed for their lifetime, with a total of 73 life-years gained [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. However, the simulation model using the same data to calculate QALYs showed a gain of only 56 QALYs with a 95% confidence interval that ranged from a loss of 21 QALYs to a gain of 97 QALYs.

         Males with abnormal results of screening may have a prostate biopsy to determine if prostate cancer is present. Complications of prostate biopsy (eg, infection, pain, bleeding, urinary obstruction) occur in up to 2 percent of males [

         </span>
         Overdiagnosis refers to the detection by screening of a condition that would not have become clinically significant in the patient’s lifetime. When screening finds cancer that would never have become clinically significant, patients have still been subjected to the risks of screening, confirmatory diagnostic testing, and potentially treatments that can result in side effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         For prostate cancer screening, the potential for overdiagnosis appears to be substantial given the high prevalence of undiagnosed prostate cancer detected on autopsy series. Overdiagnosis is of particular concern because most males with screening-detected prostate cancers have early-stage disease and may be offered aggressive therapies that may produce long-lasting adverse effects (eg, impotence, urinary incontinence). However, the increased uptake of expectant management (active surveillance or watchful waiting) rather than aggressive treatment may help to mitigate the treatment-related harms of overdiagnosis of prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies that applied computer-simulation models to study data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) or ERSPC estimated that 23 to 50 percent of prostate cancer diagnoses were likely overdiagnosed [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27-29
         </a>

         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review estimated that the percentages of screening detected cancers that were overdiagnosed was 20.7 percent in the PLCO and 50.4 percent in the ERSCP, respectively [

         In addition to potential overdiagnosis, some abnormal PSA results are false positives; no cancer will be found on follow-up evaluation. While such patients don’t incur risks of therapy, they may have anxiety about their test result and/or they may incur risks related to prostate biopsy. The false-positive rate depends in part on the patient’s baseline risk as well as the threshold chosen for PSA interpretation. (See

         Receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer is psychologically distressing, whether it is at an early stage or at an advanced stage. Anticipating treatments and their potential side effects, as well as dealing with the side effects if they occur, may lead to anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even patients with a biopsy result that is negative for prostate cancer may develop anxiety, since a negative result cannot completely rule out prostate cancer due to the false-negative biopsy rate [

         Screening that results in a diagnosis of prostate cancer may lead to therapy that carries substantial risks. For example, undergoing radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy has risks for immediate complications (eg, operative mortality, urinary symptoms) as well as for long-term sequelae (eg, urinary incontinence, impotence, and bowel dysfunction); these adverse effects are common and are described in detail separately.

         We engage in shared decision-making about prostate cancer screening. Although the randomized trials of screening all have important methodological limitations, the best available evidence suggests that screening confers a small absolute benefit for reducing prostate cancer mortality and the risk of developing metastatic disease. However, the potential harms from screening that arise from false-positive tests (eg, prostate biopsy, anxiety, overdiagnosis, and treatment complications) are common. (See

        <p>
         We encourage shared decision-making because it is not appropriate for clinicians to determine how a patient should weigh these potential outcomes. Patients are encouraged to decide for themselves whether the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. Patients and clinicians should engage in shared decision-making when initially discussing screening as well as during subsequent screening discussions (whether the patient has agreed or declined to be screened in the past) [

         Prostate cancer screening may reduce the chance of dying from prostate cancer. However, the absolute benefit is small. Most males who choose not to be screened with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test will not be diagnosed with prostate cancer and will die from some other cause. Although some of these unscreened males will die from prostate cancer, the lifetime risk of death in the United States due to prostate cancer is &lt;3 percent [

          45,46

         <a href="#rid45">
          45

         <a href="#rid46">
          46

Most included studies used decision aids developed before publication of mortality results from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening trials and before guidelines routinely recommended active surveillance for males with a low-risk prostate cancer; thus, studies evaluating updated decision aids are needed [

         Additionally, a patient who is repeating a PSA test to evaluate a result that was close to a cutoff that could prompt urologic evaluation should abstain for at least 48 hours from activities that can transiently increase PSA levels (eg, ejaculation or bicycling).

         Studies that show a potential benefit of screening with PSA studied programs that screened regularly at intervals of one to a few years. A large study in the United Kingdom failed to show a mortality benefit for a one-time screening PSA test [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with one-time screening, serial PSA testing increases the overall sensitivity. Serial screening also increases the likelihood that detected tumors will be clinically organ-confined and be moderately or well differentiated, thus more amenable to successful treatment [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61-63
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in the ERSPC with a four-year screening interval, the proportion of clinical stage I and II cancers increased from 81.5 during the first round to 96.3 percent during the second round, and the proportion of poorly differentiated cancers decreased from 8.1 to 3.3 percent [

        </p>
        <p>
         With each round of PSA testing, detection rates for prostate cancer and positive predictive values of a PSA test decline substantially [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61,62,64,65
         </a>
         ]. With screening at a four-year interval in the ERSPC, the cancer detection rate for PSA decreased from 5.1 percent in the first round of screening to 4.4 percent in the second round, and the positive predictive value (PPV) for a PSA ≥3.0 ng/mL decreased from 29.2 to 19.9 percent [

        <p>
         Two- versus four-year screening intervals appeared to have similar efficacy in detecting potentially life-threatening cancers in one nonrandomized study. Although the overall 10-year incidence of prostate cancer was higher with a two-year versus a four-year interval (13.1 versus 8.4 percent), the cumulative rates of aggressive cancers were similar and low in both groups (0.11 versus 0.12 percent); follow-up was not long enough to compare mortality rates [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. However, potentially important differences between the patients and screening methods at the two study centers limit the strength of this nonrandomized comparison of screening intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
         An alternative strategy is to adjust the frequency of testing based on the prior PSA result, with less frequent retesting in males with lower initial PSA levels (eg, ≤1.0 ng/mL) and annual testing in those with higher PSA levels that are still below a cutoff for biopsy [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67-69
         </a>
         ]. This strategy is supported by the observation that males with an initial PSA &lt;1 ng/mL had low rates of conversion (0.9 to 1.5 percent) over five years to higher PSA rates (&gt;3 to 4 ng/mL) in the PLCO and ERSPC studies [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67,68
         </a>
         ]. Cancer detection rates over four to five years were also low (0.12 and 0.15 percent) in this subgroup. For the relatively few patients who did have cancer, the four-year screening interval was estimated to result in a delay in cancer diagnosis of 15.6 months [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. The clinical consequences of delayed diagnosis on prostate cancer mortality and morbidity are unknown, although the majority of cancers detected after a four-year screening interval in the ERSPC were early-stage [

          53

Among guidelines, the suggested age to discontinue screening for prostate cancer varies from 69 to 75 years [

          7,37,39,40,47,54

         , a correction factor must be applied to a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) result for accurate interpretation, because ARIs are known to lower PSA results. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) found that males with a rising PSA level while on a 5 mg dose of finasteride for more than five years were at increased risk, compared with those with a stable or decreasing level, for being diagnosed with high-grade (Gleason 7 to 10) prostate cancer [

          73
         </a>
         ]. Only 5.6 percent of cancers were high-grade and 80.2 percent were found by end-of-study biopsies among males who did not have elevated PSA levels or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE). The Reduction by Dutasteride in Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, which enrolled males following a negative prostate biopsy, found that males whose PSA increased from a nadir at six months were at increased risk for being diagnosed with a Gleason 8 to 10 prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid74">

         We use a PSA value of ≥4.0 ng/mL on a screening test (after applying a correction factor of 2.0 to the PSA result if the patient is using an ARI) to determine if further evaluation for prostate cancer is warranted. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7568.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         A PSA of ≥4.0 ng/mL has been the most widely accepted standard to balance tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. However, there is no single PSA value that avoids missing important cancers at a curable stage, avoids false-positives and detection of clinically insignificant disease, and avoids subjecting males to unnecessary prostate biopsies. A systematic review estimated that the PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 21 percent with specificity of 91 percent for detection of any prostate cancer; for detection of a high-grade cancer, sensitivity was 51 percent [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. The low sensitivity means that some males with PSA levels &lt;4 ng/mL will have prostate cancer. In the PCPT, 15.2 percent of males with PSA levels &lt;4 ng/mL annually for seven years were found to have prostate cancer on end-of-study biopsy; 1.6 percent had high-grade prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Lowering the PSA cutoff improves test sensitivity somewhat. A PSA cutoff of 3.0 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 32 percent for detection of any prostate cancer; for detection of a high-grade cancer, sensitivity was 68 percent [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Among those with PSA between 2.1 and 4.0 ng/mL, prostate cancer was found in 24.7 percent (167 of 675 males) and 3.5 percent (four males) had high-grade cancers. Even a PSA cutoff as low as 1.1 ng/mL would have missed 17 percent of cancers, including 5 percent of the high-grade cancers [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, lowering the PSA cutoff worsens specificity and overdiagnosis. A PSA cutoff of 3.0 ng/mL has a specificity of about 85 percent for detection of any prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. It has been projected that if the PSA cutoff was lowered to 2.5 ng/mL, the number of males whose PSA is defined as abnormal would double to up to six million in the United States [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, many of the cancers that would be detected at these lower PSA levels may never have become clinically evident, so detecting them by using a lower PSA cutoff would lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overdiagnosis of prostate cancer'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Raising the PSA cutoff value increases the positive predictive value (PPV) for prostate cancer but lowers the likelihood that the cancer is organ-confined, thus potentially curable. For any PSA &gt;4.0 ng/mL, the overall PPV for prostate cancer is approximately 30 percent [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. However, for a PSA of 4.0 to 10.0 ng/mL, just somewhat above the cutoff, PPV is approximately 25 percent and nearly 75 percent of cancers are organ-confined [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. With a higher cutoff of PSA &gt;10 ng/mL, PPV increases to 42 to 64 percent, but less than 50 percent of cancers are organ-confined
         <em>
          .
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Some experts use age-specific reference ranges for PSA, rather than using the same cutoff for all ages. PSA levels generally increase with age, in part because older males are more likely to have a benign enlarged prostate producing larger amounts of PSA. However, there are limited data to support exact reference values for age cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several limitations to determining the accuracy of PSA screening. Most males with normal PSA values have not undergone biopsy unless they had a DRE that was abnormal; this workup bias leads to overestimating sensitivity and underestimating specificity of PSA to detect prostate cancer. Another limitation is the lack of consensus about which cancers are clinically important; PSA detects clinically unimportant cancers as well as important ones. Additionally, the false-negative rate of biopsy may have been as high as 10 to 20 percent in studies with &lt;12 samples per prostate biopsy [

Prior to referral, if the PSA is between 4.0 and 9.9 ng/mL, we repeat the testing in six to eight weeks, because PSA may be transiently elevated by certain modifiable benign factors (and any identified factors should be addressed prior to repeating the PSA test) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Reasons to temporarily defer PSA testing'

          Abnormal DRE
         </strong>
         – Although we do not suggest DRE for screening, if DRE is performed, males with nodules, induration, or asymmetry on prostate examination should be referred to a urologist for evaluation, regardless of the serum PSA level. However, symmetric enlargement and firmness of the prostate are frequent in males with BPH and do not typically warrant urologic evaluation unless the PSA is elevated or there are other concerns.

         Referral for urologic evaluation will not necessarily result in a prostate biopsy. Other tests (eg, free to total PSA ratio [f/T PSA], PCA3, 4Kscore test, and/or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may be done by the urologist to help determine the likelihood that the PSA is elevated due to prostate cancer, the PSA may be followed over time, or a biopsy may be performed. Relevant considerations include the patient's health status, clinical likelihood for harboring significant disease, and personal wishes. (See

         We suggest not performing digital rectal examination (DRE) for prostate cancer screening either as an adjunct to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing or as a standalone test.
        </p>
        <p>
         DRE has low sensitivity and specificity for detecting prostate cancer. In one meta-analysis, DRE performed by primary care clinicians had an estimated sensitivity of 51 percent, a specificity of 59 percent, and a calculated overall positive predictive value (PPV) of 41 percent [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. However, the quality of evidence was very low and there was substantial heterogeneity across studies. Additionally, urologists have been found to have relatively low interrater agreement for detecting prostate abnormalities [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The low sensitivity is due in part to the fact that DRE only detects palpable abnormalities in the posterior and lateral aspects of the prostate gland. Although this is where the majority of cancers arise, other areas of the prostate where cancer occurs are not reachable by a finger examination. Furthermore, about a third of cancers detected by DRE alone are clinically or pathologically advanced [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,84
         </a>
         ] compared with less than 10 percent detected by PSA screening [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85
         </a>
         ]. Stage T1c prostate cancers, the majority of screen-detected cancers, are nonpalpable by definition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although DRE and PSA are somewhat complementary and their combined use may increase the overall rate of cancer detection, DRE has limited utility as an adjunctive test. In a multicenter screening study of 6630 males, the prostate cancer detection rate was 3.2 percent for DRE, 4.6 percent for PSA, and 5.8 percent for the two methods combined [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,84
         </a>
         ]. Just 18 percent of cancers were detected only by DRE. In another study, the PPV of a suspicious DRE with a normal PSA level was 10 percent, whereas the PPV for a normal DRE with an elevated PSA level was 24 percent [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. Among males with a normal PSA level, abnormalities on DRE appeared less likely to be from a cancer if the PSA concentration was below 1.0 ng/mL than if the PSA concentration was between 3.0 to 4.0 ng/mL.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most specialty society guidelines do not suggest DRE for screening, although some [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,41,47
         </a>
         ] include DRE either to evaluate an elevated PSA, or as an option along with PSA testing.

         We do not routinely use any other testing or test interpretation strategies either for screening or for deciding which males to refer for urologic evaluation for an elevated PSA.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not use either the absolute change in PSA or the PSA velocity (ie, the rate of change of PSA over time) to determine whether to refer a patient who is not taking a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (ARI) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Referral to urology'
         </a>
         above). PSA increases more rapidly in males with prostate cancer than in healthy males. However, PSA velocity adds little predictive information to PSA alone [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87-93
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Other methods have been developed to try to differentiate between higher-risk cancers and low-risk, indolent cancers. However, the clinical utility of these strategies is uncertain, there is no consensus on using any of these tests, and additional studies for clinical effectiveness are needed. The American Urological Association (AUA) guideline noted the lack of evidence for using any tests other than PSA to determine the need for a referral for biopsy [

          Benefits and harms of screening

         – For average-risk males, many clinicians do not specifically advise in favor of or against screening. Males who are candidates for screening should be engaged in shared decision-making about whether they choose to be screened. Individual patient preferences for specific health outcomes are a deciding factor in determining whether to screen for prostate cancer. Decision aids may help patients receive consistent, complete, objective information. (See

         If a decision is made to screen for prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing alone is the most appropriate test for screening. We suggest a screening interval of one to two years. For most patients, we offer screening up to age 70 years, stopping earlier if comorbidities limit life expectancy to less than 10 years. (See
