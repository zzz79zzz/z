Hypoglycemia may result in seizures and brain damage, which lead to developmental delays, physical and learning disabilities, and, in rare cases, death [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Given these severe consequences, the prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of hypoglycemic disorders in children are crucial.</p><p>The differential of hypoglycemic disorders is broad, and it is essential to have a systematic approach when evaluating a child with hypoglycemia. The vast majority of hypoglycemic events in infants and children with hypoglycemic disorders occur during periods of fasting. This allows for categorization of hypoglycemia disorders by their specific profiles of metabolic fuels and hormones in the fasting state or during an episode of spontaneous hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Therefore, a diagnosis can be rapidly and accurately obtained by assessing the child's metabolic and hormonal response to fasting  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef121836" href="/d/graphic/121836.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Glucose homeostasis and the diagnostic approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children will be discussed here.

To ensure an adequate supply of glucose to the brain, the body must successfully adapt to fasting. Multiple systems regulate glucose homeostasis and control the transition from the fed to fasting state. Abnormalities in these "fasting regulatory systems" result in the disorders of hypoglycemia.</p><p>In response to fasting, key changes in the endocrine system occur: insulin is suppressed and the serum concentrations of the counterregulatory hormones (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13335" href="/d/drug information/13335.html" rel="external">glucagon</a>, cortisol, growth hormone, and epinephrine) rise. These hormonal changes activate the three metabolic "fasting systems" (glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and ketogenesis), which lead to increased hepatic glucose production, a gradual decrease in glucose utilization, and an increase in availability of alternative fuels  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121838" href="/d/graphic/121838.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initially, during fasting, the liver is the primary source of glucose, generated through breakdown of glycogen and production of glucose from amino acids, glycerol, and lactate via gluconeogenesis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With more prolonged fasting, the body switches to adipose tissue as the major source of fuel [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Lipolysis and ketogenesis lead to an increase in free fatty acids (FFAs) and the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) and acetoacetate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As glucose production declines and ketones levels increase, the brain gradually switches to ketones as its main fuel [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p>Glucose homeostasis and the metabolic response to fasting do not differ significantly between infants after the first two to three days of life, children, and adults. However, glucose levels decline more rapidly and the transition to ketogenesis occurs earlier in infants and young children compared with older children and adults, given infants' relatively larger brain volume and higher glucose utilization rates. The transition to ketogenesis occurs after fasting for 12 to 18 hours in neonates and infants, while in older children and adults, this transition may take up to 24 to 48 hours of fasting [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4089167520"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p>Symptoms of hypoglycemia can be divided into neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurogenic (autonomic) symptoms are caused by the sympathetic nervous system's response to hypoglycemia and appear when the plasma glucose is less than 55 to 60 mg/dL. Manifestations are sweating, tremor, palpitations, tachycardia, and hunger.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neuroglycopenic symptoms result from insufficient supply of glucose to the brain, leading to brain dysfunction. They include lethargy, confusion, irritability, loss of consciousness, and seizure. Neuroglycopenic symptoms typically occur when the plasma glucose falls below 50 mg/dL.</p><p></p><p>Although neurogenic symptoms may serve as warnings before more severe hypoglycemia occurs, repeated exposure to hypoglycemia can blunt or eliminate these symptoms and the counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia. This is known as hypoglycemic-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) or "hypoglycemia unawareness" and may result in individuals presenting with lower plasma glucose values and neuroglycopenic symptoms [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Features of HAAF have been demonstrated to occur even in infants [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

The recommendations outline which neonates, infants, and children should be evaluated for a hypoglycemic disorder according to their ability to communicate symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For neonates, evaluate those who are suspected to be at high risk of having a persistent hypoglycemia disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121837" href="/d/graphic/121837.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The diagnostic evaluation should be performed when the infant is at least 48 hours of age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For infants and younger children who are unable to reliably communicate symptoms, evaluate those whose plasma glucose concentrations are &lt;60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L), as documented by a laboratory-quality assay (a point-of-care test is not sufficient).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For children who are able to communicate their symptoms, evaluate those who demonstrate Whipple triad (symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, low plasma glucose concentration, and resolution of symptoms with normalization of plasma glucose). (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2349590013"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose concentration low enough to cause signs and symptoms of brain dysfunction (neuroglycopenia). Because the response to hypoglycemia occurs across a range of plasma glucose concentrations and signs of hypoglycemia are not reliably identifiable, especially in young children, and vary among individuals, hypoglycemia cannot be defined as a single plasma glucose concentration. However, a threshold to obtain diagnostic data and a therapeutic threshold goal are presented below:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normal plasma glucose</strong> – After the first week of life, the normal range for plasma glucose is 70 to 100 mg/dL (3.9 to 5.6 mmol/L). Normal newborns experience a period of "transitional" hypoglycemia during the first 48 to 72 hours of life. A study of 68 healthy full-term newborns found a mean plasma glucose concentration of 59±11 mg/dL during the first 48 hours of life. The plasma glucose concentration increased to a mean of 82±12 mg/dL by 72 to 96 hours of life [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic threshold</strong> – The threshold for obtaining diagnostic data (often referred to as the "critical sample") and for confirming a diagnosis of hypoglycemia is &lt;50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L), as documented by a laboratory-quality assay. This threshold is sufficiently low to avoid false-positive results but is unlikely to cause lasting neurologic sequelae.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment goal</strong> – To provide a margin of safety, the treatment goal for children with hypoglycemic disorders is to maintain a plasma glucose &gt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).

If the child's mental status is appropriate and a blood sample can be obtained rapidly, diagnostic data can be collected prior to therapeutic invention, if possible.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1566532748"><span class="h2">Critical samples</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood</strong> – When hypoglycemia is suspected based on symptoms and point-of-care glucose testing, the condition should be confirmed via venous plasma glucose.

If sulfonylurea ingestion is suspected, specific toxicology studies should also be sent. (See <a class="local">'Critical samples'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Urine</strong> – The first urine voided during or immediately after the hypoglycemic event should be collected and tested for ketones (if blood ketones cannot be measured) and urine organic acids.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2724462568"><span class="h2">Treatment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2425677556"><span class="h3">Glucose therapy</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Conscious patient</strong> – If the child is conscious and cooperative, 15 g (or 0.2 g/kg for infants) of rapid-acting carbohydrate should be given by mouth.

If glucose fails to increase after 15 to 20 minutes, a repeat bolus should be administered. Higher concentrations of dextrose are not recommended as an initial bolus, as they frequently result in hyperglycemia with a subsequent insulin surge, triggering further hypoglycemia.

Older children have lower glucose requirements and can be initially placed on a GIR of 2 to 3 mg/kg/minute (typically, dextrose 5% at maintenance rate). The GIR should be increased every 15 to 20 minutes, in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/minute until the patient's plasma glucose concentration is at least 70 mg/dL.</p><p></p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent2">GIR = (dextrose percentage × rate of infusion [mL/hr]) ÷ (6 × weight [kg])</p></div></div><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3677748402"><span class="h3">Glucagon</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the child's mental status is altered and intravenous access cannot be obtained, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13335" href="/d/drug information/13335.html" rel="external">glucagon</a> can be used to acutely increase the plasma glucose.

Hypoglycemic disorders can be categorized by the levels of the metabolic fuels (lactate, ketones, free fatty acids [FFAs]) in the critical sample obtained at the time of hypoglycemia  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef121836" href="/d/graphic/121836.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).
