         Metatarsal fractures account for the majority of pediatric foot fractures. In children ≤5 years of age, the first metatarsal is most commonly injured [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In older children, fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal is more frequent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-third of metatarsal fractures involve the shaft or distal portion of the metatarsal [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Toe fractures also occur commonly in children. The first phalanx (great toe) is most frequently involved. Distal phalangeal fractures may be complicated by nail bed injuries.

         Additional foot anatomy common to children and adults is discussed separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The pediatric toe and forefoot differ from the adult foot due to the presence of growth plates  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444" href="/z/d/graphic/79444.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Injury to the growth plate may rarely lead to growth arrest and permanent deformity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Complications'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         These growth plates typically close around age 16 years in females and age 18 years in males. Thus, management of metatarsal and toe fractures in older adolescents is the same as for adults. (See

        <p>
         Metatarsal stress fractures may occur in adolescents who rapidly undertake heavy physical activity or in those who are involved in repetitive intense training. This injury commonly affects the second metatarsal and reflects bone matrix fatigue with bone resorption that exceeds the rate of remodeling and repair [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>

          CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Children typically present for evaluation because of pain and difficulty walking.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and occur within the first few hours after injury. Palpation along the foot or digit frequently reveals point tenderness at the fracture site. However, the dorsum of the foot or toe may be diffusely swollen and tender, making it difficult to pinpoint the fracture location by examination alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal after an inversion injury is highly suggestive of a fracture and may not be accompanied by significant swelling soon after the injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         With displaced fractures and dislocations, deformity is usually apparent. Rotational deformity is assessed by examining the orientation of the nail bed of the fractured toe. Rotational deformity is present if the nail bed does not lie in the same plane as that of the corresponding toe on the opposite foot [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In all cases, capillary refill should be assessed, and the skin of the digit carefully inspected, seeking lacerations and devitalized skin. Any wound should be carefully examined to exclude communication with the fracture site (ie, an open fracture). Devitalized skin may slough and convert a closed fracture into an open one. Injury to surrounding soft tissue including the nail and nail bed can occur, particularly with crush injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subungual hematoma is often a marker of an underlying distal phalanx fracture [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         We recommend that patients with significant pain, swelling, or deformity of the forefoot or toe receive plain radiographs, including anterior-posterior, lateral, and oblique views [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Growth plate injuries are described using the Salter-Harris classification system  (

          figure 3
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiographic findings include growth plate, cortical, and buckle fractures. Salter-Harris I through Salter-Harris III fractures are most common in the great toe  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582" href="/z/d/graphic/54582.html" rel="external">
          figure 3

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial radiographs are typically normal in children with Salter-Harris I fractures or metatarsal stress fractures. Repeat radiographs two weeks later show periosteal reaction and callus formation. Bone scan is helpful in doubtful cases, especially for the diagnosis of early stress fractures in adolescents.

          4,6

         Compartment syndrome – Compartment syndrome presents with marked swelling and pain out of proportion to the degree of injury. Pallor, paresthesias, and pulselessness are late signs. Emergent orthopedic consultation is indicated. Once the clinician suspects an acute compartment syndrome, compartment pressures must be measured to determine whether they are elevated, or a clinical decision to perform a fasciotomy is needed.

         Nail bed injuries are seen frequently with distal phalanx fractures sustained from a fallen object. Subungual hematomas can cause severe pain, often indicate the presence of a distal phalanx fracture, and should be drained within 24 hours if painful. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6335.html" rel="external">
          "Subungual hematoma"

        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of nail bed lacerations is controversial. Some recommend removing the nail to detect the presence of a laceration if there is significant traumatic deformity of the nail or a sizable subungual hematoma [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. They advocate laceration repair with absorbable sutures, following irrigation, if the wound is less than eight hours old [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The primary justification for this approach lies in the high correlation between nail bed injury and distal phalanx fracture, with the consequent risk of osteomyelitis associated with open fractures. Others, citing data showing no difference in outcome, advocate against removal of the nail and nail bed laceration repair [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. We do not advocate routine nail removal and nail bed laceration repair, and perform this procedure only when obvious malalignment of the nail bed laceration is present.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since a distal phalanx fracture with a subungual hematoma is technically an open fracture, some clinicians prescribe prophylactic oral antibiotics for five to seven days (eg,

         Nondisplaced and minimally displaced solitary metatarsal fractures may be treated with a cast boot, posterior splint, or a short leg walking cast. These patients should be evaluated by an orthopedist with pediatric expertise within one week to 10 days. Casting should be avoided in patients with marked foot swelling to avoid the development of a tight cast or compartment syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Children with multiple nondisplaced or minimally displaced metatarsal fractures should be placed in a non-weight bearing splint or cast and referred to an orthopedist with pediatric expertise within one week. Any proximal metatarsal fractures should be evaluated for possible injury to the tarsometatarsal joint complex  (

         Completely displaced metatarsal fractures and those with more than 20 degrees of angulation in children over eight years of age warrant closed reduction followed by immobilization with a non-weight bearing short leg cast or short leg splint. Sedation in the emergency department usually suffices to control the pain of the fracture reduction. Follow-up orthopedic evaluation should occur within one week. (See

         In children, avulsion of the base of the fifth metatarsal may be confused with an apophyseal center called the os vesalianum  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857" href="/z/d/graphic/78924.html" rel="external">
          figure 1A-C
         </a>
         ). Avulsion fractures will have localized tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Avulsion fractures arising from the tuberosity of the proximal fifth metatarsal heal well, typically within four weeks, with symptomatic and supportive treatment (eg, stiff soled shoe or cast boot, ice application, elevation, and rest)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56014" href="/z/d/graphic/56014.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). As an example, in a retrospective observational study of 47 children and adolescents with these fractures, none subsequently underwent surgery [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/211.html" rel="external">
          "Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures", section on 'Tuberosity fracture: Zone 1 injury'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In adolescents, an apophysis (growth center associated with a tendon insertion) can often be seen in the tuberosity. It always lies parallel to the long axis of the fifth metatarsal and has smooth, corticated edges  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56985" href="/z/d/graphic/56985.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ). Apophysitis, an inflammation of the apophysis, may develop in active adolescents. This self-limiting condition resolves with completion of growth and is treated with rest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute fractures of the proximal diaphysis (Jones fracture), first described by Jones in 1902, occur within 1.5 cm of the metatarsal tuberosity and extend towards or into the intermetatarsal joint  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56014" href="/z/d/graphic/56014.html" rel="external">
          figure 4

          figure 5
         </a>
         ). The area where these fractures occur is referred to using different terms, including "proximal diaphysis" and "junction of the metaphysis and diaphysis." This region is at some risk for painful nonunion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67602" href="/z/d/graphic/67602.html" rel="external">
          image 2

          image 3
         </a>
         ). Initial care consists of immobilization with a below-knee non-weight bearing cast or splint and orthopedic consultation within one week. Symptomatic nonunion can occur in children and young adolescents with a Jones fracture [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The site of the fracture appears to strongly influence whether surgery is ultimately needed. As an example, in a study of 238 patients with a fracture of the fifth metatarsal, fractures that occurred between 20 and 40 mm (or 25 to 50 percent of overall metatarsal length) from the proximal tip went on to surgery in 6 out of 32 patients, whereas only 5 percent (9 of 184) of patients with fractures &lt;20 mm for the proximal tip had surgery [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. For older elite adolescent athletes, surgery may result in more rapid healing. (See

         These fractures most frequently affect young athletes (eg, long distance runners, gymnasts) and most commonly occur in the neck of the second metatarsal. They usually respond well to cessation of the causative activity for four to eight weeks. Crutches and partial weight bearing for several weeks may be helpful in patients who have mild to moderate pain with walking. A short leg cast with non-weight bearing is appropriate for patients with severe pain. Metatarsal stress fractures are discussed in more detail separately. (See

          Clinical presentation and examination
         </strong>
         – Following fracture of the toe or metatarsal bone, ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and occur within the first few hours after injury. Palpation along the foot or digit frequently reveals point tenderness at the fracture site. Tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal after an inversion injury is highly suggestive of a fracture. Subungual hematomas are often markers of an underlying distal phalanx fracture. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical presentation and examination'

          Imaging
         </strong>
         – We recommend that patients with significant pain, swelling or deformity of the forefoot or toe receive plain radiographs, including anterior-posterior, lateral, and oblique views. Common injury patterns include growth plate  (

          figure 3

         <strong>
          Emergency conditions
         </strong>
         – The clinician should obtain emergency orthopedic consultation in patients with vascular compromise, compartment syndrome, or open fractures of the metatarsal bone or proximal phalanx. (See

          Analgesia and initial care

         – For children with no signs of neurovascular compromise, initial therapy consists of analgesia and measures to reduce swelling and pain, including evacuation of a painful subungual hematoma. (See
