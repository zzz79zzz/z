The most recent What's New entries are at the top of each subsection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H350_142441"><span class="h1">COVID-19</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H144008"><span class="h2">Simnotrelvir-ritonavir for mild to moderate COVID-19 (January 2024)</span></p><p>Although <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="134695" href="/z/d/drug information/134695.html" rel="external">nirmatrelvir-ritonavir</a> reduces hospitalization and death from COVID-19, the many drug interactions make it difficult to use in some patients. Simnotrelvir-ritonavir is a similar protease inhibitor combination that inhibits viral replication but does not have as many drug interactions. In a randomized, double-blinded study of over 1000 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (majority fully vaccinated), 5 days of simnotrelvir-ritonavir reduced time to symptom resolution by 1.5 days [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Since no participant progressed to severe disease or died by day 29, it is unknown whether the drug prevents hospitalizations or death from COVID-19. Simnotrelvir-ritonavir has emergency use approval in China but is not yet approved for use in other countries. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting", section on 'Therapies of limited or uncertain benefit'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143258"><span class="h2">Convalescent plasma in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 (November 2023)</span></p><p>Most randomized trials have not demonstrated a benefit for convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and we do not routinely use it in this setting. However, an open-label trial of 475 patients who were mechanically ventilated for severe COVID-19 did report a reduction in 28-day mortality with high-titer convalescent plasma compared with standard care (35 versus 45 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The inconsistency of this finding compared with the lack of effect in most other trials decreases confidence in the mortality benefit. Furthermore, the value of convalescent plasma against Omicron variants and in the context of contemporary management remains uncertain, as only a few patients in the trial had Omicron infection and most received only <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> without other immunomodulatory agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults", section on 'Limited role for antibody-based therapies (monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143217"><span class="h2">Lower survival among recipients of donor hearts from donors with active COVID-19 (November 2023)</span></p><p>It is unclear whether donor hearts from donors with active COVID-19 have similar survival when compared with those from donors without COVID-19. In a recent study of nearly 5900 patients who underwent heart transplantation, one-year survival was lower among recipients of hearts obtained from donors with active COVID-19 when compared with recipients of hearts from donors without COVID-19 (77 versus 91 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The cause of higher mortality was unclear, and despite adjustment for confounders, the difference in survival could be the result of unmeasured confounders or bias. The decision to accept a donor heart depends on each recipient's ongoing risk of waiting for transplantation and risks associated with the potential donor, including the donor's COVID-19 status at the time of donation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/118102.html" rel="external">"Heart transplantation in adults: Donor selection and organ allocation", section on 'Donors with COVID-19'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143057"><span class="h2">Aerosol generation during noninvasive respiratory support modalities (October 2023)</span></p><p>Studies have reported conflicting data as to whether high levels of aerosols are generated when noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is used. In a 2023 systematic review including 12 studies in patients with respiratory infections and 15 studies in healthy volunteers, use of NIV or HFNO was not associated with increased generation of pathogen-laden aerosols compared with controls with unsupported normal or labored breathing, low-flow nasal oxygen, or oxygen or nonrebreather mask [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Inconsistency among studies may reflect differences in sampling and detection methodologies and operating room ventilation. Notably, the National Health Service in the United Kingdom has removed mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation from its list of aerosol-generating procedures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/140910.html" rel="external">"Overview of infection control during anesthetic care", section on 'Considerations during aerosol-generating procedures'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141353"><span class="h2">Updated COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recommendations (September 2023)</span></p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have updated COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and recommendations [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Available COVID-19 vaccines have been updated to target Omicron variant XBB.1.5 (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130318" href="/z/d/drug information/130318.html" rel="external">Moderna COVID-19 vaccine</a> 2023-2024 formula, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 2023-2024 formula, and Novavax 2023-2024 formula); bivalent vaccines are no longer available. An updated 2023-2024 formula vaccine is recommended for all individuals aged six months and older. Immunocompetent individuals five years and older should receive one updated vaccine, regardless of prior vaccination history. For individuals who are four years or younger or have an immunocompromising condition (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef132490" href="/z/d/graphic/132490.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), the number of recommended updated vaccines depends on their vaccination history. Our approach to COVID-19 vaccination is consistent with these recommendations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Indications and vaccine selection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Benefits of vaccination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142441"><span class="h2">Adjunctive immunomodulators for severe COVID-19 (August 2023)</span></p><p>For patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who require high-flow oxygen or ventilatory support, we suggest adding <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="118052" href="/z/d/drug information/118052.html" rel="external">baricitinib</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/z/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">tocilizumab</a> to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> to further reduce mortality. Other immunomodulatory agents may also improve outcomes. In a randomized trial of patients with severe COVID-19, most of whom were on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="127259" href="/z/d/drug information/127259.html" rel="external">remdesivir</a> and glucocorticoids, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8984" href="/z/d/drug information/8984.html" rel="external">infliximab</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8526" href="/z/d/drug information/8526.html" rel="external">abatacept</a> each reduced 28-day mortality compared with placebo (10 and 11 versus 15 percent) but did not improve time to clinical improvement [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The trial did not detect a benefit with cenicriviroc. Despite their potential efficacy, we do not routinely use infliximab or abatacept for COVID-19, because they do not offer clear advantages over baricitinib or tocilizumab, which have more established benefit and, in the United States, are approved for this indication. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127429.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults", section on 'Limited roles for alternative immunomodulators'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H128_143279"><span class="h1"> ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143439"><span class="h2">Adverse effects with piperacillin-tazobactam versus cefepime (November 2023)</span></p><p>Observational data have raised concerns for nephrotoxicity with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9777" href="/z/d/drug information/9777.html" rel="external">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (when given with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10037" href="/z/d/drug information/10037.html" rel="external">vancomycin</a>) and neurotoxicity with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9215" href="/z/d/drug information/9215.html" rel="external">cefepime</a>. In an open-label trial of over 2500 patients randomly assigned to piperacillin-tazobactam versus cefepime, the incidence of major kidney events was comparable between groups (9 versus 10 percent), including among the 1900 patients who also received vancomycin [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Median antibiotic use was three days. Although the incidence of neurotoxicity (primarily delirium) was higher with cefepime (21 versus 17 percent), imbalances in baseline delirium rates reduce confidence in that finding. These data reduce concern for nephrotoxicity with short-term coadministration of piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (eg, for initial empiric therapy). For those who warrant prolonged therapy with vancomycin plus an antipseudomonal agent, we weigh the uncertain risks of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity when choosing between piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/479.html" rel="external">"Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects", section on 'Renal reactions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143279"><span class="h2">Sulbactam-durlobactam for Acinetobacter infections (November 2023)</span></p><p>Antibiotic options for infections due to <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp are limited due to high rates of resistance. The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved a new beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor antibiotic, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="141569" href="/z/d/drug information/141569.html" rel="external">sulbactam-durlobactam</a>. In an international randomized trial of 125 patients with carbapenem-resistant <em>Acinetobacter </em>infection (mainly hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia), sulbactam-durlobactam resulted in a trend toward lower all-cause mortality that was not statistically significant (19 versus 32 percent) and a higher clinical cure rate (62 versus 40 percent) compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8718" href="/z/d/drug information/8718.html" rel="external">colistin</a> [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. We reserve this agent for patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia or bacteremia due to susceptible <em>Acinetobacter baumannii </em>complex isolates that are resistant to other first-line agents (ie, other beta-lactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3150.html" rel="external">"Acinetobacter infection: Treatment and prevention", section on 'First-line antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H122_142436"><span class="h1">BACTERIAL INFECTIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143364"><span class="h2">Diagnostic "mini" bronchoalveolar lavage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (November 2023)</span></p><p>Bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Mini-BAL is less invasive than BAL and can be performed in ventilated patients by nurses and respiratory therapists with lower rates of complications. A meta-analysis of six studies in which patients underwent both mini- and bronchoscopic BAL (in succession) reported a sensitivity of mini-BAL for VAP that was 0.9 and a specificity that was 0.83 [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. These results confirm the role of mini-BAL as a reasonable alternative to bronchoscopic BAL for the diagnosis of VAP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1635.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia", section on 'Invasive respiratory sampling'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143058"><span class="h2">Polymicrobial sepsis from platelet transfusion (October 2023)</span></p><p>The risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection is exceedingly low. However, a recent report documented seven cases of polymicrobial sepsis across six different states, three of which were fatal, from platelet transfusions [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. An investigation determined the source to be the manufacturing facility of the apheresis platelet collection sets. This report highlights the importance of reporting suspected transfusion reactions to facilitate such investigations and the need for ongoing vigilance, despite the overall high and continuously improving safety of blood products. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3805.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection", section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143038"><span class="h2">Ceftobiprole for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (October 2023)</span></p><p>Antibiotic options for treatment of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) bacteremia are limited. In a randomized trial including 387 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia (75 percent methicillin-susceptible), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9001" href="/z/d/drug information/9001.html" rel="external">ceftobiprole</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9304" href="/z/d/drug information/9304.html" rel="external">daptomycin</a> resulted in similar rates of treatment success, defined as the combination of survival, symptom improvement, <em>S. aureus</em> bloodstream clearance, absence of new bacteremia-related complications, and no use of other potentially effective antibiotics (70 versus 69 percent), and serious adverse events (19 versus 23 percent) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The most common sources of bacteremia were soft tissue infection and osteoarticular infection; the median treatment duration was 21 days. The trial was not powered for subgroup evaluation; further evaluation of ceftobiprole in patients with MRSA bacteremia, specifically, is needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3164.html" rel="external">"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Treatment of bacteremia", section on 'Agents warranting further study'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142436"><span class="h2">Revised Duke criteria for diagnosis of infective endocarditis (August 2023)</span></p><p>The Duke criteria for diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) have been revised to reflect changes in the epidemiology of IE, as well as new imaging and diagnostic tools [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Disease criteria classify <em>Enterococcus faecalis </em>as a typical cause of IE regardless of acquisition site (eg, community or healthcare associated) or presence of a primary extracardiac focus; previously <em>E. faecalis </em>was included as a major criterion only if community acquired and in the absence of a primary focus. The criteria also incorporate advances in microbiologic diagnostic testing, such as tissue polymerase chain reaction (such as amplicon or metagenomic sequencing and in situ hybridization). Advances in imaging include improved understanding of the diagnostic utility of cardiac computed tomography (CT) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with CT for detection of IE.

A new echinocandin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="141155" href="/z/d/drug information/141155.html" rel="external">rezafungin</a>, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is now available for adults 18 years or older with candidemia or invasive candidiasis who have limited alternative options [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Approval was based on two randomized trials that found no difference in overall mortality, clinical cure, or mycological eradication with rezafungin compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9175" href="/z/d/drug information/9175.html" rel="external">caspofungin</a> [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Of note, the trials excluded children, patients with severe liver disease, and patients with endocarditis, osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infection, central nervous system infection, or eye infection. Rezafungin is unique in that it is administered as a once-weekly infusion, which is practical for outpatient echinocandin therapy; however, we continue to favor the other echinocandins for initial inpatient management and oral azole therapy for step-down therapy.

A randomized trial evaluated the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9532" href="/z/d/drug information/9532.html" rel="external">pitavastatin</a> for primary prevention in over 7700 persons with HIV ≥40 years of age receiving antiretroviral therapy who had a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score &lt;15 percent [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Pitavastatin reduced the relative risk of major cardiovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) by 35 percent compared with placebo; the trial was stopped early for this apparent benefit.
