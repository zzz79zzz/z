         Patients with liver disease may develop acute or chronic pain from a variety of causes. In addition to causes that are common in an otherwise healthy population, patients with advanced liver disease may have ascites (leading to abdominal and lower back pain) and gynecomastia (leading to mastalgia).
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain is a common symptom among patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, and prescriptions for analgesic medications are often provided [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In a systematic review of five studies, the prevalence of pain in patients with end-stage liver disease ranged from 30 to 79 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In a database study from the Veterans Health Administration including over 100,000 patients with cirrhosis, the annual percentage of patients receiving an opioid prescription increased over time from 36 percent in 2005 to 47 percent in 2014 [

         This topic will summarize safety considerations of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective NSAIDs (COX-2 inhibitors), opioids,

         , and agents for neuropathic pain in patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. The recommendations regarding analgesic use in patients with advanced chronic liver disease are also summarized in the accompanying table (

         Management of pain in patients with liver disease raises special concerns. The choice of appropriate analgesic agents requires a thorough understanding of their pharmacokinetic and side effect profiles [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90196" href="/z/d/graphic/90196.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         As a general rule, patients with mild liver disease can be treated with a similar choice of drugs as those who are otherwise healthy. Susceptibility to adverse effects increases with worsening liver function due to altered pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic changes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3572.html" rel="external">
          "Tests of the liver's capacity to transport organic anions and metabolize drugs"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The exact cutoff at which drug doses and the selection of drugs should be altered is uncertain. Modifications of drug-prescribing should generally be considered in patients who have developed advanced chronic liver disease (eg, bridging fibrosis on biopsy) or cirrhosis, particularly when accompanied by portal hypertension (such as those with esophageal varices, ascites, or portal gastropathy/colopathy) or renal insufficiency. Important exceptions are patients who are actively drinking alcohol and those on multiple medications, who can develop severe hepatotoxicity from concomitant use of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen

         regardless of the severity of liver disease.

         </span>
         Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with an increased risk of variceal hemorrhage, impaired renal function, and the development of diuretic-resistant ascites [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Thus, NSAIDs (including
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         ) should generally be avoided in patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90196" href="/z/d/graphic/90196.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The primary effect of NSAIDs is to inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin synthase), thereby impairing the ultimate transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. Two related isoforms of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme have been described: COX-1 and COX-2. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">
          "NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action"

         </span>
         NSAIDs inhibit the production of prostaglandins involved in the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa from noxious agents such as gastric acid. They also inhibit the production of thromboxane leading to decreased platelet aggregation and impaired hemostasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients who take
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         or other NSAIDs are at least three times as likely to have severe gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcers compared with patients who do not take NSAIDs. (See

          "NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis and risk factors for gastroduodenal toxicity"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         This risk may be further increased in patients who have an underlying coagulopathy, such as occurs in those with advanced cirrhosis.

          Aspirin
         </a>
         alone or in conjunction with other NSAIDs has been associated with variceal bleeding. In one case-control study, patients with variceal bleeding were 2.8 times as likely to have used NSAIDs in the week prior to the bleed compared with patients with cirrhosis with esophageal varices who had not bled [
         <a href="#rid5">

         NSAIDs can induce two different forms of acute renal failure: hemodynamically-mediated and acute interstitial nephritis (which is often accompanied by the nephrotic syndrome). The former and perhaps the latter are directly related to the reduction in prostaglandin synthesis induced by the NSAID. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7230.html" rel="external">
          "NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although renal prostaglandins are primarily vasodilators, they do not have a major role in the regulation of renal hemodynamics in healthy subjects since the basal rate of prostaglandin synthesis is relatively low. By contrast, the release of these hormones (particularly prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2) is increased by underlying glomerular disease, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, and the vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and norepinephrine. The secretion of the last hormones is increased in states of effective volume depletion such as cirrhosis, heart failure, and true volume depletion due to gastrointestinal or renal salt and water losses. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7230.html" rel="external">
          "NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The adverse effect of NSAIDs on renal function in patients with cirrhosis has been demonstrated in multiple studies (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89932" href="/z/d/graphic/89932.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>

         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. In one study, patients given 50 mg of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8559" href="/z/d/drug information/8559.html" rel="external">
          indomethacin
         </a>
         every six hours for one day had a 19 percent reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 23 percent reduction in renal plasma flow [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, there was a 29 percent increase in serum creatinine. Another study examined the effect of indomethacin on renal function in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Significant reductions in GFR, urinary sodium, urinary output, and renal plasma flow were observed.

         </span>
         Another concern related to use of NSAIDs in patients with cirrhosis is that they diminish the natriuretic effects of diuretics in patients with ascites, leading to impaired free water clearance and worsening of ascites and edema. Use of NSAIDs should be considered when evaluating patients with apparent diuretic-resistant ascites. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1258.html" rel="external">

         </span>
         Selective COX-2 inhibitors are effective analgesics that are associated with a decreased incidence of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. However, they have been associated with an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. At present, we advise against using these agents in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis because data are limited on their use in such patients (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90196" href="/z/d/graphic/90196.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7968.html" rel="external">
          "NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In rat models of cirrhosis and ascites, selective COX-2 inhibitors caused significantly less decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine volume, and free water clearance than a nonselective COX inhibitor [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. However, rats given the COX-2 inhibitor still had nearly a 25 percent decrease in urine volume and a 20 percent decline in GFR from baseline.
        </p>
        <p>
         Experience with COX-2 inhibitors in patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis is limited. The largest study in humans included 28 patients with cirrhosis and ascites who were randomly assigned to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/z/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">
          celecoxib

         (200 mg every 12 hours for a total of five doses),
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">
          naproxen
         </a>
         (500 mg every 12 hours for a total of five doses), or placebo [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. A significant reduction in GFR, renal plasma flow, urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion, and suppression of the diuretic and natriuretic response to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">
          furosemide
         </a>
         was observed in the group receiving naproxen but not celecoxib or placebo. Furthermore, naproxen, but not celecoxib or placebo, significantly inhibited platelet aggregation. The authors concluded that celecoxib may be a reasonable option for anti-inflammatory treatment of patients with cirrhosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the study evaluated only short-term treatment, involved only a small number of patients, and, as noted above,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/z/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">
          celecoxib
         </a>
         has the potential to decrease GFR compared with baseline. Further studies are needed to address the use of COX-2 inhibitors in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis.

          codeine
         </a>
         are difficult to predict, and therefore alternatives should be considered. Chronic administration of any opioid may lead to tolerance requiring escalating doses and therefore an increasing risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of opioids are used for pain control. Opioids exert their analgesic effect through at least four groups of receptors and probably other subpopulations as well. The distribution of these receptors throughout the body, along with their tissue densities within numerous organ systems, account for the global and varied effects of these drugs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126633.html" rel="external">
          "Pharmacologic management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Opioids'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As a general rule, these medications are metabolized through hepatic oxidation and glucuronidation. The clearance of opioids depends upon plasma protein binding, hepatic blood flow, and hepatic enzyme capacity. Oxidative enzyme pathways and opioids clearance are impaired in cirrhosis, which may lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolites [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>

After the labs returned to normal, the same patient was subsequently challenged with 10- and 14-day courses of 4 grams per day of acetaminophen without incident. It was thought that the earlier biochemical deterioration in this patient was not related to acetaminophen use.

          acetaminophen
         </a>
         with extreme caution. We suggest that patients who actively drink alcohol consume no more than 2 grams per day. In healthy subjects, only a fraction of acetaminophen is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system to NAPQI. In patients with alcohol use disorder, the P450 system is induced and therefore more of the toxic metabolite NAPQI is generated. The hepatotoxicity of NAPQI is diminished by glutathione conjugation. However, patients with alcohol use disorder have reduced stores of glutathione secondary to impaired production and poor nutritional status. (See

         use among patients with alcohol use disorder. A retrospective analysis of 67 patients, described as regular users of alcohol who developed hepatic injury after acetaminophen ingestion, showed that 60 percent of the patients took less than 6 grams per day; 40 percent of those patients took less than 4 grams per day [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. There was no elevation in aminotransferases compared with the placebo group. Unfortunately, there are limitations when interpreting these data. First, patients were in an inpatient alcohol detoxification program and were therefore not actively drinking when using acetaminophen. Second, it was not clear whether patients had advanced liver disease (which may have made them more predisposed to liver injury); that patients were excluded who had an international normalized ratio of &gt;1.5 suggested that hepatic synthetic function was relatively preserved. Thus, these data may not be applicable to patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis who are actively drinking alcohol.

         , this should be done over weeks because the drug has a delayed onset of action). Low maintenance doses (eg, 25 to 50 mg) should be used to decrease the risk of drug and metabolite accumulation. (See

         Cannabis has many beneficial effects, such as pain and nausea control, anxiolysis, and appetite stimulation [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Cannabinoid-type drugs are commercially available in the United States. They are approved for chemo-induced nausea and vomiting and appetite stimulation. However, the use of cannabis and cannabinoids for symptom control in patients with advanced liver disease and cirrhosis is not routinely recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
         The active component of cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and there are two known cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). THC is metabolized by CYP2C9 and 3A4 in the liver. In cell culture, CB1 receptor activation is associated with hepatic stellate cell activation, inflammation and fibrosis. Conversely, CB2 receptor activation inhibits liver fibrosis [

        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical data on the safety of cannabis use is limited and conflicting and long-term risks of cannabis use are unclear. Cross-sectional studies in patients with hepatitis C virus infection suggest that daily cannabis use is associated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-32
         </a>
         ]. However, longitudinal studies in patients with HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfection have not found an association between cannabis use and progression of liver fibrosis [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,34
         </a>
         ]. Cannabis intoxication may worsen or mimic hepatic encephalopathy. Positive urine toxicology for THC may negatively impact candidacy for liver transplantation.

          General principles
         </strong>
         – As a general rule, patients with mild liver disease can be treated with a similar choice of drugs as those who are otherwise healthy. Susceptibility to adverse effects increases with worsening liver function due to altered pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic changes. While the exact cutoff at which drug doses and the selection of drugs should be altered is uncertain, modifications of drug-prescribing should generally be considered in patients who have advanced chronic liver disease (eg, bridging fibrosis on biopsy) or cirrhosis, particularly when accompanied by portal hypertension (such as those with esophageal varices, ascites, or portal gastropathy/colopathy) or renal insufficiency. Important exceptions are patients who are actively drinking alcohol, who can develop severe hepatotoxicity from concomitant use of

         regardless of the severity of liver disease. (See

          Specific analgesic agents
         </strong>
         – The choice of appropriate analgesic agents in patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis requires a thorough knowledge of their pharmacokinetics and side effect profiles (

          Acetaminophen
         </a>
         is an effective and safe analgesic for most patients with chronic liver disease. It is frequently recommended that patients with cirrhosis or advanced chronic liver disease limit acetaminophen intake to 2 grams per day. We typically limit acetaminophen intake to 2 grams per day for most patients, while avoiding it entirely in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis or acute liver injury. (See

         Many prescription and over-the-counter remedies are offered as combination preparations. Patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis need to be warned to read medication labels carefully before starting any new medicine to avoid accidental overdose. (See

         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with an increased risk of variceal hemorrhage, impaired renal function, and the development of diuretic-resistant ascites. Thus, NSAIDs (including

         Selective COX-2 inhibitors are effective analgesics that are associated with a decreased incidence of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity and an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Experience in patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis is limited. At present, we advise against using these agents in such patients. (See
