         Insomnia is a condition of impaired sleep, with difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep and/or experiencing sleep as nonrestorative and unrefreshing, despite having the appropriate opportunity for sleep to occur, which causes impairment in daytime functioning or other consequences for the patient during the day. As insomnia can be an associated symptom of many other conditions, a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder is recommended to be considered only when it is separate and distinct enough to require independent attention and treatment. The technical qualities of the definition of insomnia can minimize the distress that often accompanies a patient’s experience of insomnia. Patients rightfully attribute great value to having consistent restful sleep at night. When this becomes impacted, anxiety, impaired daytime function, and worsened quality of life frequently follow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, insomnia is a very common medical complaint in primary care patients, and the same is true for patients in palliative care, which is illustrated by studies that report that the prevalence of insomnia is over 60 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Insomnia is associated with multiple consequences that have a negative impact on quality of life and the ability to perform normal functions. In addition, insomnia is a strong predictor of the development of psychiatric disorders. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7684.html" rel="external">
          "Risk factors, comorbidities, and consequences of insomnia in adults", section on 'Adverse outcomes'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients receiving palliative care may vary in terms of their functional status and where they are in their personal trajectory in a chronic illness. As a result, the approach and treatment to insomnia in these patients should be individualized with careful attention to the patient’s goals. Interventions for insomnia should be reviewed as a patient’s disease course unfolds and adjusted as needed to ensure the benefits of treatments continue to outweigh the risks that are acceptable to the particular patient. An overview and the general treatment approach to insomnia, as well as an overview of palliative care and the assessment of patients in palliative care, are discussed separately. (See

         </span>
         According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition, Text Revision (ICSD-3-TR), insomnia is present if the patient reports the following  (

         The ICSD-3-TR classifies insomnia in three categories: chronic insomnia disorder (symptoms occurring at least three times per week for more than three months), short-term insomnia disorder (duration of less than three months), and other insomnia disorder [

         Clinicians should evaluate for factors that may contribute to sleep disturbances, which can potentially be addressed. These include:

         Physical symptoms – The presence of other physical symptoms may exacerbate sleep disturbances and vice versa [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Multiple symptoms can predispose to sleep disturbances. In one study of 70 inpatients in a specialized palliative care unit, pain was the most frequently cited reason by patients who did not sleep through the night [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]; others included breathlessness, cough, and hiccups. Pain symptoms may increase at night, perhaps because when patients are less distracted by the events of the day, they have more attention available to experience the pain. Insomnia can worsen this phenomenon and therefore lead to increased pain and analgesic use. Further, insufficient sleep may lower the threshold of tolerable pain.
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Emotional distress, psychiatric illness – Palliative care patients may experience heightened distress due to fear, anger, or concern over their illness and approaching end of life, which can prevent initiation or maintenance of sleep. A diagnosis of anxiety or depression can also contribute to sleep disturbance [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Palliative care patients with insomnia frequently describe anxious and negative ruminations, due to either a diagnosed mental disorder or as part of a sub-syndromal constellation of symptoms. Topics for ruminations or anxious thoughts include the various aspects of their disease, the uncertainty of what lies ahead, what else they could have done, who will take care of them or their children, will physical suffering be unbearable, or whether they will wake in the morning. Inquiring about these types of thoughts can help the patient share the true burden of their insomnia and is often therapeutic. (See

         Environmental factors – Exposure to loud or active stimuli (eg, music, other people’s conversation, computer screens, television, beeping alarms, pill crushers) can preclude restorative sleep and exacerbate insomnia. For patients who are in an inpatient facility, this also includes clinician-centered activities, such as rounds during the evening, medication scheduling, waking the patient for assessments during sleep, and increased light exposure during the night. The reported incidence of insomnia among hospitalized patients varies. (See

         The patient’s physical condition – As patients progress in their illness, insomnia may be exacerbated by symptoms associated with declining performance status, including becoming more bedbound, daytime somnolence, and more sedentary behavior. These changes can lead to the patient losing the normal cues for when sleep should occur thus worsening insomnia. Sleep during the day decreases the homeostatic drive to sleep at night.

         Insomnia is common and can be highly distressing to patients and their caregivers. Taking an active approach in determining the patient’s overall goals can help inform how to approach the treatment of their insomnia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients facing serious illness often report that night is a time of great worry, due to ruminations on their mortality, the uncertainty of their disease trajectory and what they may expect going forward for their lives, as well as fears of whether they may even wake up the next day. When discussing insomnia, inquiring about these types of symptoms and thoughts can elucidate the burdens of their insomnia. Allowing the patient to share these common experiences can be a therapeutic intervention that also contributes to the clinician’s understanding of the impact of the insomnia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the context of palliative care, insomnia often coexists with other symptoms, such as pain, depression, and anxiety, and the presence of one often exacerbates the other, contributing to a decrease in quality of life [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,7
         </a>
         ]. Assessing for factors that may be contributing to insomnia is critical in the palliative care patient population prior to treatment [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Whenever possible, clinicians should attempt to treat potentially reversible contributors to insomnia (eg, pain control, suppression of cough, treatment for depression). In addition, patients who experience symptoms in addition to insomnia may be best managed by the administration of agents that list somnolence as a side effect (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9656" href="/z/d/drug information/9656.html" rel="external">
          mirtazapine
         </a>
         for depression, nausea, or appetite stimulation). At the same time, however, agents used to treat insomnia should have as little risk as possible of causing or exacerbating other conditions (eg, delirium).
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to insomnia should take into account the patient’s overall clinical status. Patients who are receiving palliative care but maintain a relatively better prognosis and have minimal comorbid conditions will likely tolerate typical pharmacologic treatments for insomnia similarly to medically healthy individuals. In this case, the discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of possible pharmacologic interventions can be similar to what would be done with a general medical patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, patients who are approaching end of life or are more debilitated may be more susceptible to the side effects of pharmacologic treatment due to drug-drug interactions or the presence of end-organ impairment [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,16,17
         </a>
         ]. Thus, for any proposed treatment, it is necessary to have a heightened awareness of the potential adverse effects balanced with a consideration of the likelihood of benefit, the patient’s goals, and what matters most to them. In this case, the risks discussed with a patient, or their surrogate, should include a careful discussion of the possibility of delirium, general cognitive decline, lingering daytime somnolence, and falls. In this risk/benefit discussion, the clinician should fully consider the experiences described by the patient during the assessment of their insomnia. Patients may experience of insomnia as extremely burdensome, a time of profound worry with severe anxious and negative ruminations, contributing to daytime somnolence and loss of function. The impact of a patient’s insomnia on their caregivers should also be considered. For example, if a patient is awake much of the night and therefore needing their caregiver’s attention, the caregiver may start to suffer significantly as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there are no prospective studies that inform an evidence-based approach, common steps include managing the symptoms related to the sleep disorder and nonpharmacologic interventions to improve sleep, including managing the environment, lifestyle modifications, sleep hygiene, and behavioral modification. For many patients, a combined approach is most helpful.

         </span>
         Clinicians should aim to aggressively manage symptoms associated with sleep disturbances in the particular patient. For example, for patients who cannot sleep due to pain, the use of long-acting pain medications (or titration of doses at night) may help provide relief. Symptom management also includes removal or the judicious dosing of any stimulating agents that might be exacerbating insomnia, such as steroids and psychostimulants. For example, if agents with stimulant properties (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">
          dexamethasone

         ) are required, they should be administered in the morning and not later in the day. For patients exhibiting signs of spiritual distress, this also includes the involvement of chaplaincy. (See

         Exercise interventions have been evaluated for treatment of insomnia in patients with cancer, and meta-analyses have found inconsistent results, perhaps due to the heterogeneity of trials [

        <p>
         However, in a 2020 meta-analysis of 27 trials conducted among cancer patients with sleep disturbance using subjective and objective measures, both aerobic exercise and mind-body exercise (eg, yoga, qigong, tai chi) improved sleep outcomes compared with a variety of active and inactive control interventions [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. The duration of effect was longer for aerobic exercise (greater than three to fix months) than for mind-body exercise. While difficult to extrapolate to the entire palliative care patient population, if a patient is well enough to engage in one of these types of exercise, it may provide benefit for their insomnia without exposing them to risks of additional pharmacology.

         Helping to modulate a more normal circadian rhythm can restore sleep in patients. For example, increased exercise and regular exposure to daylight for at least an hour every morning have been shown to restore sleep cycles among patients with Alzheimer disease [
         <a href="#rid22">

         In addition, clinicians should encourage the maintenance of familiar routines so long as the patient is able. For example, if a patient routinely showers and has a snack prior to bed, then this routine should be continued when feasible. As a disease progresses, alternate bedtime routines may be created to allow for the types of activities that are tolerated by the patient.

         For patients with persistent insomnia despite environmental-associated modifications, behavioral therapy is the first line of treatment of insomnia. Although there are no prospective data to demonstrate efficacy in patients in palliative care, behavioral therapies should be tried initially because they avoid the potential risks associated with medications.

         While mindfulness-based interventions have been found to be beneficial for a variety of indications in hospice and palliative care settings, there are no studies evaluating mindfulness-based techniques for treating insomnia in palliative care. In a meta-analysis of studies in the general population, mindfulness meditation was found to “mildly improve” sleep in patients with insomnia without significant adverse effects, suggesting it may be safe in other populations such as those with medical illness [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Additional research is needed in palliative care populations.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no studies specifically evaluating the benefits of CBT-I in palliative care populations. In a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials that compared CBT with control conditions (eg, waitlist control, usual care, or sleep education) in 752 cancer survivors with insomnia, self-reported sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, frequency of waking after sleep onset, and insomnia severity each improved more with CBT-I, and the clinical effects favoring CBT-I ranged from small to large [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. CBT has also been recommended for older adult patients to target insomnia [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. A nurse-driven behavioral intervention was found to be effective for survivors of stage 1 and 2 non-small cell lung cancer [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. CBT-I has been difficult for many patients to access in part due to lack of available trained therapists. A noninferiority study of cancer patients with insomnia used a step-based approach to CBT-I, first starting with a web-based intervention and then only moving patients who failed to have an adequate response to that intervention to face-to-face CBT-I. They found that this more widely accessible stepwise intervention strategy was not inferior to the standard face-to-face CBT-I treatment of insomnia that has previously been proven to treat insomnia in cancer patients. Unfortunately, they had an exclusion criterion of needing to have a prognosis of greater than one year. Thus, the applicability of this approach to many patients receiving palliative care is still unclear [

         Several trials have examined the benefit of multicomponent interventions to improve sleep in palliative care populations (mostly nursing home residents), many of which demonstrate benefit from a combined approach. Three studies showed significantly better nighttime sleep outcomes when environmental modification was combined with sleep hygiene [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>

         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. One randomized trial combining physical activity and sleep hygiene showed better nighttime sleep [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ], while a second trial that included physical activity, sleep hygiene, and an environmental component found no significant improvement in sleep [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Another study using both sleep hygiene and the mind-body practice of relaxation showed improved sleep in cancer patients with insomnia [

          33
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although not all studies found benefit from combining specific interventions, layering different approaches appears to be helpful to at least some patients, and they are all low-risk interventions. A 2021 clinical practice guideline for behavioral and psychologic treatments of insomnia in the general adult population published by the American Society of Sleep Medicine continues to show evidence for using a multicomponent approach to the treatment of insomnia [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. While this guideline is not specific to palliative care, these recommendations reflect our own anecdotal experience working with the palliative care population, in that a multicomponent approach is often what is needed to be effective, especially with patients who have been struggling with insomnia on a chronic basis.

         The palliative care patient may have a varying sensitivity and risk associated with the use of the common pharmacologic treatments for insomnia. It is important to carefully discuss with a patient their overall goals, how their insomnia may be impacting their quality of life, and what risks may be acceptable to them as medications are considered to address their insomnia. As noted above, patients who encounter palliative care early in their disease trajectory, when they are still relatively healthy, may tolerate and respond to typical sleep aids as well as a medically healthy patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients at an advanced stage of illness are more likely to suffer adverse effects from sleep aids. The risk/benefit analysis may shift for the patient as their disease status changes. It will be important to revisit the decision to use medications and the overall treatment strategy for their insomnia over time.
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest that medications be prescribed for insomnia only after attempting nonpharmacologic interventions, as discussed earlier. In addition, careful attention to associated symptoms may be especially important in this population because of the risk of unintended consequences. As examples:

         In the absence of prospective data, the approach to the selection of a sleep aid should be individualized, and the lowest effective dose should be administered.

Its primary side effects appear to be related to its antagonism of the muscarinic cholinergic receptors. When administered at a low doses (ie, 3 to 6 mg), these side effects may not be encountered [

         Coadministration with opioids can be problematic.

         <a href="#rid50">
          50

         ]. Although the study was not conducted in palliative care population, the risks are likely equal or greater in palliative care patients. (See

         While insomnia is a common complaint in patients with a history of a substance use disorders (SUD), benzodiazepine receptor agonists should generally be avoided in this population. It is felt that the risk of misuse of this class of medication, or the potential for triggering relapse, is usually too high to balance out the potential benefits [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52
         </a>
         ]. When a patient with a SUD is also requiring opioids, such as for pain or dyspnea, this risk/benefit analysis is even more important to consider carefully as the combination can become lethal if taken in excess. A prescriber should discuss this significant risk with their patient and consider setting up safeguards to help their patient maintain control over their use. Examples may include having a trusted caregiver keep medications with risk of abuse, dispensing a limited quantity each day, providing limited numbers with each prescription but allowing frequent refills, and ensuring that
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9678" href="/z/d/drug information/9678.html" rel="external">
          naloxone
         </a>
         is prescribed as well. When pharmacologic intervention is needed to treat insomnia in a patient with a SUD, an alternative medication may be considered first. Typical alternatives have often included

        <p>
         Taking these points into account, a clinician may decide to have a discussion with their patient about the patient’s overall goals, the severity of their insomnia and the burden they experience from it, and what interventions to address the symptoms are reasonable to try for their particular situation. For example, some patients may decide that the possibility of falls, cognitive impairment, delirium, and even increased mortality is worth taking to try improving their insomnia. In this situation, one may consider starting a time-limited trial at the lowest effective dose, titrating as needed and tolerated, and then reevaluating over time whether the risk/benefit ratio is still in alignment with the patient’s goals and if the medication is improving the patient’s quality of life.

         In addition, there have been no prospective or long-term studies to assess the efficacy and safety of longer-term use (ie, two weeks or longer) in patients receiving palliative care. Therefore, use of these medications should be individualized based on the patient’s current status, prognosis, goals, and underlying medical condition. As noted above for benzodiazepine receptor agonists, a careful individualized discussion may be had with the patient to carefully assess their specific goals, severity and burdens of their insomnia, and what risks are acceptable to them when weighed against the possible benefit of a trial of a benzodiazepine to treat insomnia. As benzodiazepines are often used to treat other symptoms in the palliative care patient population, one approach may be to adjust the dose timing to bedtime rather than adding on an additional dose.

         Melatonin is a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland that can assist with maintaining sleep-wake cycle. It is a widely available over-the-counter agent that is often used to alleviate insomnia, despite the lack of prospective data, as well as other conditions. (See

         Unfortunately, double-blind placebo-controlled trials have not demonstrated consistent findings in terms of dose-response relationships, benefits, and risks, although most experts believe that, at doses ranging from 0.3 to 20 mg, melatonin is well tolerated without adverse effects. In general, it does not appear to be particularly effective for insomnia in most patients, with the possible exception of patients who have delayed sleep phase syndrome and in a subgroup of patients with low melatonin levels.

However, for patients who find benefit from this agent, be aware that there may be dose and quality inconsistencies in preparation across various brands.

         Older adult patients often have multiple comorbid medical conditions that can contribute to sleep disturbances. This in turn can make them more susceptible to the adverse effects of sleep aides. Therefore, it is important to maximize treatment and palliation of any comorbid conditions as the primary approach to treatment of insomnia.

         In addition, there are known changes in sleep structure and quality that occur with aging, including increased and prolonged nighttime awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency, reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced time spent in deep sleep [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. These can result in increased daytime fatigue and more frequent napping. Given the potentially increased risk for adverse outcomes with pharmacologic agents, it is important to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of these medications through a discussion with older patients to determine if a drug trial aligns with their goals. In general, it is our practice to instead “prescribe” nonpharmacologic interventions such as education regarding sleep hygiene before using medications.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we encounter older palliative patients who have been prescribed benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists, we discuss with the patient, or their surrogate if appropriate, the risks and benefits of continuing to use these agents. Deprescribing these medications is often advisable as the risk of adverse events increases as a patient ages or becomes more frail. Many patients have become very attached to their sleep aid and may find it difficult to stop. With education and open discussion, a shared decision about whether to continue or taper off should be made. Many factors will go into this risk-benefit analysis, including the patient’s current physical and cognitive states, current experience of benefit or harm to quality of life, duration of use, and their prognosis.

         If drugs are necessary, choose drugs with the fewest likely adverse effects, start at the lowest potential effective dose, and use time-limited trials; note that for most hypnotics, starting doses are lower for older adult patients. For patients taking a pharmacologic sleep aid, frequent reassessments should be performed for efficacy, continued need, and the development of adverse effects.

         In a 2020 Cochrane review of sleep aides for patients with dementia, several studies showed some benefit from the use of

         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. The trazodone trial was small, including only 30 participants, used an average dose of trazodone at 50 mg and found that total sleep time increased by 43 minutes. However, total time number of awakenings did not change. There were no serious adverse events noted. The studies of orexin antagonists, including 323 subjects, found few adverse effects in patients with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type. The effect sizes were small, but some patients and caregivers may find any extra sleep welcome. For example, in the studies looking at orexin antagonists, the total time asleep increased by 28 minutes, but there was little impact on the total number of nighttime awakenings. Unfortunately, these studies did not look at measurements of quality of life for the patient or the caregivers. This review also looked at five trials evaluating melatonin, which did not show benefit in improving sleep.

         and orexin antagonists reviewed in this Cochrane article are encouraging, but the authors noted that they did not actually find improvements in time of uninterrupted sleep for patients with dementia. They also found that side effects of the medications were not systematically assessed. Finally, the authors concluded that additional studies are needed, which resonates with our impression that studies specifically designed to evaluate outcomes in patients receiving palliative care are needed.

         Although the data are more limited, the patient’s insomnia can significantly impact their caregiver’s sleep quality and overall quality of life [

         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. Disrupted sleep is common among caregivers. In a systematic review of 10 published studies, 72 percent of caregivers reported moderate to severe sleep disturbance, and some experienced up to a 44 percent reduction in total sleep time (from the typical eight hours) [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. The caregivers describe a negative impact on mood, irritability, anxiety, and finding themselves falling asleep in dangerous situations, such as while driving. A significant factor impacting the caregivers’ sleep was the insomnia of the patient. Thus, when considering the risks and benefits of a treatment plan for the patient’s insomnia, the impact of successful treatment on the caregivers should also be taken into account.

         Insomnia is a condition of impaired sleep, with difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, and/or experiencing sleep as nonrestorative and unrefreshing, despite having the appropriate opportunity for sleep to occur. It is estimated that insomnia affects over 70 percent of palliative care patients. (See

         When insomnia is present, it is important for clinicians to evaluate the full impact this symptom is having on the patient and their family. Insomnia frequently correlates with severely diminished quality of life in multiple domains. Anxiety, including highly distressing negative anxious ruminations, should be assessed. Allowing time for a patient to describe their personal experience with insomnia can not only help with the evaluation but can also be therapeutic in itself. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General principles'

         If patients receiving palliative care report insomnia, clinicians should evaluate other factors that may contribute to sleep disturbances, which can potentially be addressed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Associated factors'

         The approach to insomnia should take into account the patient’s clinical status. Patients receiving palliative care but who maintain a relatively better prognosis and have minimal comorbid conditions will likely tolerate typical pharmacologic treatments for insomnia similarly to medically healthy individuals. However, patients who are approaching the end of life or are more debilitated may be more susceptible to the side effects of pharmacologic treatment due to concerns over drug-drug interactions or the presence of end-organ impairment. When developing a treatment plan, the degree of suffering from the insomnia, as elicited in a thorough evaluation, needs to be considered. Patients may elect trials of medications, even though there is risk of adverse effects, for the possibility that their insomnia may be effectively palliated. (See
         <a class="local">

         Clinicians should aim to aggressively manage symptoms associated with and/or contributing to sleep disturbances in the particular patient. (See
         <a class="local">

         Addressing environmental issues may help address external factors exacerbating insomnia in these patients. This includes keeping patient rooms cool, well ventilated, and with low light at night, the use of white noise machines, and limitations on the use of computers at night and other stimuli (eg, television, loud music). (See

         A number of lifestyle modifications may promote a more regular sleep pattern and can be instituted in a palliative care setting. These include reducing or avoiding daytime naps, large meals before bedtime, drinking a large amount of fluid in the evening, or stimulants, including caffeine. Daytime light exposure and activity levels should be increased when possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Lifestyle modifications'

         Clinicians and staff should minimize disruptions of a patient’s sleep. Regardless of setting, dimming lights in the vicinity of the palliative care patient’s room may provide a simple cue to others to maintain a calm, quiet, sleep-promoting environment. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients with persistent insomnia despite environmental-associated modifications, when practical and available, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a first line of treatment of insomnia. Although there are no prospective data to demonstrate efficacy in patients in palliative care, behavioral therapies may be tried because they avoid the potential risks associated with medications and may augment any medication intervention as well. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Behavioral therapy'

         In consideration of each patient’s unique place in their disease trajectory, their current level of medical debility, the intensity of the suffering associated with their insomnia, and the patient’s tolerance for risk of possible adverse effects, medications may be considered. When practical and in line with a patient’s goals, we suggest that medications be prescribed for insomnia only after attempting nonpharmacologic interventions. There is no single pharmacologic approach that can be recommended for all patients. The approach to the selection of a sleep aid must be individualized, and the lowest effective dose should be administered. As with most drugs, patients in palliative care must be carefully and continually monitored for both positive effect and the development of adverse effects, particularly as the patient’s disease progresses. (See
         <a class="local">

         Clinicians should be cognizant of the impact of insomnia on the sleep quality of other members in the patient’s family or household members, particularly those who act as the primary caregivers. The negative impact on caregivers may affect the ability of the patient to remain at home. (See
