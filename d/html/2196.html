Although some palliative care skills require subspecialty training to learn and apply, the core elements of palliative care, such as aligning treatment with a patient’s goals and basic symptom management, should be aspects of the care delivered by all practitioners [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Palliative care is not limited to end-of-life care and can be provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging treatments  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64252" href="/z/d/graphic/64252.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a>.)</p><p>Patients in the advanced stage of a serious and/or life-threatening illness typically experience multiple symptoms, the most common of which are pain, depression, anxiety, confusion, fatigue, breathlessness, insomnia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and anorexia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87163" href="/z/d/graphic/87163.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>]. These symptoms may result from a number of factors. Among patients with advanced cancer, for example, symptoms may result from the disease (eg, bone pain from metastases, dyspnea from pleural effusions), from treatment (eg, esophagitis with thoracic radiation therapy), from other concurrent conditions (eg, osteoarthritis), or from medications (eg, dry mouth, constipation).</p><p>This topic review provides a suggested approach to assessment for the most common physical and psychological symptoms that arise in patients receiving palliative care for an advanced serious and/or life-threatening illness. The principles underlying the comprehensive palliative care assessment (which include domains other than physical and psychologic symptoms) and an overview of treatment for symptoms commonly encountered in a palliative care population are provided elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2197.html" rel="external">"Overview of comprehensive patient assessment in palliative care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2199.html" rel="external">"Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patient descriptions of physical symptoms and their severity are the primary data for symptom assessment in palliative care. Exploring patients’ reports of symptoms requires thoroughness, persistence, and patience; this is a fundamental aspect of patient-centered care.</p><p>It is important to assess mental status and stamina before starting to elicit information as to the nature and severity of symptoms. Seriously fatigued patients may only be able to answer a few questions briefly, and more than one visit may be necessary. Patients who are confused or delirious will not be able to cooperate fully, making symptom identification and assessment difficult; failure to recognize delirium may lead to inaccurate assessments and inappropriate therapies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4824.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with advanced illnesses typically have multiple symptoms, and systematic assessment is preferable to relying on spontaneously described symptoms. A study of patients referred to a palliative medicine program found that there were 10 symptoms for every one symptom that was volunteered by a patient [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Health care providers tend to underestimate symptom severity [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. This can lead to missed opportunities for diagnosis and symptom relief. A careful review of symptoms with a focus on common problems in palliative care practice is required. Comprehensive symptom assessment can contribute to significant symptom improvement and better quality of life [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>Each identified symptom should be investigated in regard to its Onset, Palliating and Provoking factors, Quality, Response to previous treatments, Related factors/symptoms, Severity, and Temporality (the OPQRST historical structure for evaluating medical complaints). Of comparable importance, but less emphasized, is understanding the personal meaning of a symptom to the patient and how the symptom affects their psychosocial wellbeing (the MOPQRST mnemonic)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87818" href="/z/d/graphic/87818.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Sample questions to explore the meaning of specific symptoms include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“Of the symptoms that have been bothering you, which symptom bothers you the most [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]?” This will identify a primary symptom in one-third of patients who would otherwise be missed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“How do the symptoms affect you? How much do they interfere with your life? (eg, sleep? daily activities? your sense of wellbeing?)”</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“What ideas do you have about the meaning of these symptoms?”</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“Do they make you worry about your health/illness? What are your concerns?”</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“How are these symptoms affecting your family and friends?”</p><p></p><p>Discussing symptoms with the patient’s caregivers may also be informative and provide opportunities to be supportive and educate family and friends [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Following initial assessment, periodic symptom reassessment is valuable for identifying or modifying treatment goals, monitoring the response to specific symptomatic interventions, and for communicating between members of the health care team and with caregivers.</p><p>Availability of time may be the greatest barrier to performing symptom assessment. Many of the aspects discussed below are presented to help the practitioner think about and follow up on a patient’s answers during symptom assessment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4277426"><span class="h2">Dimensions of symptom assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dimensions are different aspects of symptoms, such as severity, frequency, level of interference with activities, and level of distress associated with the symptom.</p><p>Symptom severity is a useful guide to treatment (eg, pain) and it may also provide some prognostic information (eg, dyspnea). (See <a class="local">'Performance status, symptoms, and prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of rating instruments that are completed by patients themselves represents a major change in symptom assessment over the last 30 years. In evaluating symptoms, it is helpful to obtain the patient’s rating of severity within a given time frame, such as the last 24 hours. The approach to rating pain relies exclusively on how the patient reports pain, using a verbal or numerical scale. The patient can be asked to make a mark on a 10 cm straight line (Visual Analog Scale [VAS])  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346" href="/z/d/graphic/62346.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) or rate severity on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is worst. These approaches are based upon psychophysical studies in the field of subjective sensory physiology, where it has been shown that perception of a stimulus is closely related to the strength of the stimulus [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. For many symptoms, however, there is no clear evidence as to what the optimal cut points are to define symptom severity [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Assessment and rating instruments for symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients are unable to rate their symptom severity on a numerical scale [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. An alternative approach is to ask patients for their rating of symptom distress rather than severity and to give them categories of response (eg, bothered not at all, a little bit, somewhat, quite a bit, very much). Some symptoms, such as fatigue, may be rated by patients as mild in severity but severe in distress. The amount and type of interference with daily activities caused by a symptom also can illustrate symptom severity and provide another means of determining therapeutic success.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4277550"><span class="h2">Symptom change</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient’s assessment of symptom relief is also important since it drives the therapeutic plan. The definition of the minimum clinically significant differences in symptom instruments for pain, fatigue, and dyspnea has been an important advance in the interpretation of symptom ratings and can be considered to be a 2 point change on an 11 point scale, eg, 0 to 10  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346" href="/z/d/graphic/62346.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), or any change in categories of a Likert scale, such as the faces pain scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef67351" href="/z/d/graphic/67351.html" rel="external">form 1</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19-23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1507215"><span class="h2">Challenges in symptom assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of situations raise particular challenges for symptom assessment in palliative care patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient’s assessment of symptoms may differ from that of the health professional. In general, clinicians (and caregivers) have greater discordance with patients in assessing the severity of subjective symptoms (eg, pain, anxiety) than for objective states, such as the presence of vomiting. Clinicians tend to rate the severity of symptoms lower than patients and family members and tend to tolerate levels of symptom-related distress and suffering that patients find unacceptable [<a href="#rid24">24-28</a>]. By contrast, family members tend to overrate symptoms as well [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>]. However, where pain is concerned, older family members tend to overrate while younger family members tend to underrate pain [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients may downplay or not report symptoms (particularly pain) because of fears that worsening symptoms reflect disease progression and that the oncologist will stop treatment. Underreporting may also occur if a patient feels that a symptom such as pain is an inevitable consequence of the disease, its treatment, or dying. In addition, if patients do not receive attention to oft-voiced complaints, they may stop communicating about distress related to that specific complaint.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms can change over time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Many symptoms are multifactorial in origin. A comprehensive assessment process will help define all the possible factors that may be causing a specific symptom. (See <a class="local">'Approach to specific symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients and/or their families or other loved ones may have suffered harm in the health care system and lost trust in the system and/or care providers. This may make them particularly reluctant to discuss psychological symptoms. Particularly in these cases, the assessment interview with the patient and family may itself have therapeutic value in enhancing the care provider relationships with patient and family, eliciting care preferences and developing trust. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/84028.html" rel="external">"The initial interview in palliative care consultation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cultural factors may determine which symptoms are acceptable for discussion between patients and clinicians and how patients perceive their symptoms. For example, women from certain cultures may not be comfortable sharing gynecologic complaints with a male clinician [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, at least one study suggests that for most symptoms, culture may have a limited impact on how patient-reported symptoms are ultimately interpreted. In this study, over 1400 patients from five countries (United States, China, Japan, Russia, and Korea) were evaluated for the severity and interference of symptoms related to their cancer and/or treatment using psychometrically validated language versions of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The authors found only limited variations in symptom reporting due to cultural or linguistic variations. The exception to this was with the reporting of nausea and vomiting. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Language can pose barriers. In Europe, the assessment of fatigue may be challenging because the word itself is only found in English and French [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients may have difficulty communicating. Examples include intubated patients in the intensive care unit, patients who are withdrawn or who have cognitive impairment, and those who are just too ill to voice complaints. As patients near death, symptom assessment becomes more difficult because the majority of patients become noncommunicative and other symptoms, such as restlessness and confusion, may interfere with effective communication. The study of behavioral changes as clues to the presence of pain (eg, grimacing) is an area of ongoing research and forms the basis for observer-based rating instruments such as the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia [PAINAD] tool  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59509" href="/z/d/graphic/59509.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). A similar tool (the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale) has been developed for assessment of dyspnea  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113282" href="/z/d/graphic/113282.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Patients unable to self-report'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Involved family members and caregivers may be asked by health professionals to assess and rate symptoms (proxy ratings). However, there may be disparities between patient and caregiver symptom assessments or ratings [<a href="#rid29">29,37,38</a>]. For patients with impaired communication, the palliative care consultant may have to balance multiple assessments by family, caregivers, and health care personnel. (See <a class="local">'Patients unable to self-report'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Care providers (clinicians and nurses alike) may not be aware of the high prevalence of symptoms in these patients, may not have symptom assessment incorporated into their conversations with patients, and may lack knowledge about symptom identification and management. The average number of symptoms ranges from 11 to 18 in a wide variety of illnesses [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients may be very demoralized, tired of being sick, and feeling helpless and hopeless [<a href="#rid42">42</a>], and they simply stop reporting symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Demoralization'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT AND RATING INSTRUMENTS FOR SYMPTOMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Formal multiple symptom assessment tools, especially those that are symptom inventories, like the revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65702" href="/z/d/graphic/65702.html" rel="external">table 5</a>), provide a good overview of symptoms in individual patients [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. In particular, multiple symptom assessment tools are highly effective in the recognition of unreported symptoms, when combined with further patient interviewing to delineate the details of positive responses. When a specific tool has been chosen, it should be used consistently to ensure reliability in the clinical setting.</p><p>Many of these symptom assessment tools have been tested for reliability and validity. However, like any other measurement of health outcomes, there are potential errors in assessment [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The possibilities for assessment errors include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Motor, hearing, and visual impairments may impede the usefulness of symptom assessment tools in older adults [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive dysfunction may lead to misleading responses and inaccurate assessment, even when paired with behavioral indicators [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The cognitive dysfunction may be quite subtle. (See <a class="local">'Patients unable to self-report'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Shorter tools may miss symptoms that are important to the patient, and longer tools may be too tiring for patients to complete. (See <a class="local">'Challenges in symptom assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As the patient’s condition changes, symptom ratings may change as they accommodate to the new condition, even if the symptom has not changed. This is referred to as the phenomenon of response shift. Ratings may also be influenced by other symptoms, especially anxiety and other emotional reactions, which may change over time. (See <a class="local">'Symptom change'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Interpretation of the “anchors” (0 and 10 on the numerical 0 to 10 scale) may vary between patients, depending upon their previous experience.

Somatic nociceptive pain involves injury to somatic structures like skin, bone, joints, or muscles. It is usually well localized and is often described by patients as “aching,” “stabbing,” or “throbbing” in quality. Visceral nociceptive pain results from distension, injury to, or inflammation of visceral organs. It is usually poorly localized and is characterized as “gnawing” or “crampy” when arising from the obstruction of a hollow viscus (eg, the bowel lumen), or as “aching” or “stabbing” when arising from other somatically innervated visceral structures, such as organ capsules or parietal pleura.

Family members or other loved ones may be able to provide important information in this regard. Pain can interfere with quality of life by interfering with daily activities, walking, and sleep and by affecting mood. Severe pain may engender a sense of hopelessness and anxiety.

Especially for inpatients, procedural pain is an experience that is often overlooked. Breakthrough pain may result from such routine procedures as dressing changes for pressure ulcers or wounds, positioning for change of bed sheets, or movement in bed for a radiographic study [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2795.html" rel="external">"Assessment of cancer pain", section on 'Pain characteristics'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia", section on 'Management of breakthrough pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The term “pseudoaddiction” describes a situation in which a patient’s legitimate chronic pain condition is undertreated with pain medication, leading the patient to act in a way that resembles addictive behavior (requesting extra medications and demanding attention); such patients are often labeled as demonstrating “drug-seeking behaviors.” The situation arises when a clinician is reluctant to provide enough of a controlled drug to provide adequate symptom relief for a patient who requires long-term treatment [<a href="#rid83">83-85</a>]. This leads to a patient who is either chronically undertreated or intermittently put into withdrawal. The patient responds with a series of “conditioned behaviors” focused on acquisition of the controlled drug that can appear to indicate aberrant addictive-type behaviors. However, in pseudoaddiction, the behaviors disappear when an adequate amount of the drug is obtained. A careful pain history that emphasizes perceived pain relief may help clarify the issue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, it should be noted that the whole concept of pseudoaddiction has been questioned; empirical evidence supporting pseudoaddiction as a diagnosis distinct from opioid addiction has not emerged [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. Use of the term is accepted for justification of opioid therapy for nonterminal pain in patients who appear to be addicted but, for whatever reason, are not diagnosed with an addiction to opioids. This is a controversial issue, particularly in the era of widespread opioid addition and overdose. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7804.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, health consequences, screening, and assessment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient and family perspective</strong> – Patients and their family members or other loved ones should be asked about the meaning of the pain, their understanding of its cause, worries about relief, personal and cultural attitudes, concerns about opioid tolerance and addiction, diversion, and expense.

However, opioids are also potentially abusable drugs. The public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all clinicians assume responsibility for risk management when these drugs are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2792.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids", section on 'Risk assessment and management for patients receiving opioids'</a>.)</p><p>Assessing and managing pain is difficult in patients who have a history of substance abuse. Patients with a history of substance abuse who complain of pain can cause considerable apprehension for their care providers because of fears about the potential for deception, drug abuse, addiction, and diversion [<a href="#rid87">87</a>].</p><p>Patients with a remote history of substance use and who have a stable support system are less likely to abuse opioids [<a href="#rid88">88</a>]. In our own experience, these patients appreciate a careful and objective pain evaluation and are generally responsible and appropriate in their use of opioids as a component of their medical treatment. Further inquiry into the circumstances of past substance use is helpful. Sometimes they and their family members are even more concerned about addiction to pain medications than professional staff.</p><p>Patients who are actively using “street drugs” at the time of initial evaluation should have a careful and objective pain evaluation. The possibility that they are using street drugs to obtain pain relief should be considered. Even if they have an addiction, their pain is real and assessment needs to focus on ways to both treat their pain and help with their addiction. The initial encounter with the patient is most important, as failure to establish a relationship will make it nearly impossible to obtain an accurate pain history and render trials of medications impossible to interpret. These and other issues that arise when considering the need for acute pain management in patients chronically using opioids are addressed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83726.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in the patient chronically using opioids for non-cancer pain"</a>.)</p><p>Principles of risk management in these patients are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50477" href="/z/d/graphic/50477.html" rel="external">table 9</a>). Psychologic evaluation may be helpful in evaluating underlying psychiatric or personality disorders.

The spectrum of patients who have impaired communication includes patients with permanent deficits, such as dementia, and those with more temporary cognitive impairments such as delirium, sedation, or trauma. Patients with impaired ability to self-report pain present across the continuum of care, from intensive care units to clinics, home, and long-term care settings. Individuals who are unable to communicate their pain are at greater risk for underrecognition and undertreatment of pain.</p><p>Patients with mild dementia are often able to give a description and rating of their pain. Patients with advanced dementia may express pain by distress behaviors such as restlessness, grimacing, moaning, guarding, and changes in daily activity, but these behaviors are not specific for pain. When such behaviors occur, a physical examination should be performed with attention to the association of the pain behavior with movement, pressure, toileting, hunger, fear, loneliness, or visual impairment.</p><p>A hierarchical approach has been proposed for this set of patients, whereby multiple sources of information are integrated by the examiner, starting with patient report, and including reports from observers (proxy reporting of pain), observation of patient behavior, use of behavioral pain assessment tools, and search for potential causes of pain [<a href="#rid89">89</a>].

However, for unclear reasons, it is also a common symptom in patients with no direct lung pathology [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]. As an example, a National Hospice Study found that 24 percent of terminally ill cancer patients had dyspnea in the absence of known cardiopulmonary pathology [<a href="#rid96">96</a>].

Breathless patients inevitably reduce their activity level to accommodate dyspnea, so questions about limitations in performing specific activities can be used to assess the impact of dyspnea. As an example, the Oxygen Cost Diagram  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64769" href="/z/d/graphic/64769.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid99">99</a>] asks patients to identify the level of activity they are unable to perform due to dyspnea, giving clinicians valuable information regarding the functional impact of the symptom. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14238.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care", section on 'Symptom assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Patient-rated scales of dyspnea intensity have been based upon psychophysical descriptions of the relationship between work and perceived exertion. As an example, the modified Borg scale  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981" href="/z/d/graphic/63981.html" rel="external">table 11</a>) measures the severity of dyspnea using a scale from 0 to 10, anchored by descriptive words; it may be used in conjunction with an exertional test [<a href="#rid100">100</a>]. The most common exertional tests involve having the patient walk for 6 or 12 minutes and then rate their dyspnea afterwards. A correlation between the 0 to 10 numerical scale and a four-level categorical verbal descriptor scale for dyspnea has been observed (0, none; 1 to 4, mild; 5 to 8, moderate; 9 to 10, severe) [<a href="#rid101">101</a>].</p><p>For patients with COPD, the frequency and severity of dyspnea can be assessed using validated questionnaires such as the Clinical COPD Questionnaire  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86308" href="/z/d/graphic/86308.html" rel="external">table 12</a>) or the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), a shortened version of which is available [<a href="#rid102">102</a>]. Although these approaches are useful for evaluating symptom severity in patients with COPD, neither is appropriate for patients with advanced serious life-threatening illness and severe dyspnea at rest.

In addition to dysphagia, other factors that predispose to aspiration include reduced consciousness, which compromises the cough reflex; mechanical disruption of the upper airway or gastrointestinal tract; and recumbent patients who receive large volume tube feedings and feeding gastrostomy. All patients with these conditions should be asked about and observed for cough after swallowing. A history of coughing while eating or drinking is likely to indicate aspiration, but aspiration may also be clinically silent.

In addition to cough, helpful signs include drooling after swallowing, wet or hoarse vocal quality after swallowing, head or neck repositioning while swallowing, and multiple attempts to swallow a bolus. When evaluated with formal swallowing studies, some of these patients will be found to have laryngeal penetration. In such cases, a balance has to be struck between quality of life issues (ie, continue eating despite the high risk for aspiration) and safety considerations (mechanical soft or pureed diets, nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube, or nothing by mouth). Interestingly, many patients who aspirate when swallowing still are able to swallow small pills without difficulty.

Determining whether patients feel they “look like themselves” may lead to a discussion of weight loss. Cachexia is a hypercatabolic state that is characterized by an accelerated loss of skeletal muscle in the context of a chronic inflammatory response, and it should be distinguished from sarcopenia, loss of muscle. In advanced illness, weight loss is not remedied by nutritional supplementation. Important physical findings that support the suspicion of cachexia are temporal wasting, thenar wasting, and dorsal interosseous wasting.

It includes assessment of disturbances in awareness, orientation, short-term memory, digit span, attention capacity, organized thinking, perception, delusions, psychomotor activity, and arousal in a way that reflects all the main diagnostic criteria according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Illness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The MDAS has been used and validated for screening and diagnosis of delirium in cancer patients [<a href="#rid175">175</a>] and is able to distinguish patients with delirium from those with other cognitive or noncognitive psychiatric disorders. In one study, a cutoff score of 7/30 on the MDAS yielded the highest sensitivity (98 percent) and specificity (96 percent) for the diagnosis of delirium [<a href="#rid175">175</a>]. In many institutions, this tool has replaced the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) for assessment and monitoring of delirium.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The bedside confusion scale (ability to recite the 12 months in reverse order and assessment of consciousness state) is another excellent tool to screen and longitudinally follow delirium in palliative care [<a href="#rid176">176</a>]. Serial-sevens and spelling a word such as “farm” or “world” backward are other simple tests of attention. Another bedside test of attention is outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59119" href="/z/d/graphic/59119.html" rel="external">table 26</a>).

Sometimes even necessary investigations may have to be eliminated or postponed because of patient frailty.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2095425588"><span class="h1">ONGOING RESEARCH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several areas that pertain to symptom assessment are actively being studied.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Item response theory – Item response theory (IRT) represents a newer approach to determining the severity of a construct, including symptoms. Originally, IRT was based upon educational testing. If one wanted to determine which grade a high school student was in from answers to questions (items), one would ask a question that might be answerable only by a 12<sup>th</sup> grader and another that might be answerable by a 9<sup>th</sup> grader. If one has a wide variety of items that cover all grades (an item bank), then assessment of all the answers can precisely identify what grade the respondent is in. However, this approach is quite time consuming. Another option is to have an interactive interview where a computer helps select items based upon answers as they come in (computerized adaptive testing [CAT]); this results in fewer items needed to assess “severity” or educational level. Another is to select a limited number of items for pencil and paper versions. Potential advantages of IRT are that a smaller number of items can yield as much information as a standard questionnaire, and that the wider range of responses to the IRT questionnaires will avoid “ceiling” and “floor” effects where all participants in a survey answer yes or no to all of the questions. Item banks have been developed and tested for symptom severity and quality of life analysis, and the resulting questionnaires, both computer-assisted and pencil and paper versions, are entering research and clinical applications [<a href="#rid177">177</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electronic symptom assessment – With electronic capabilities, the next step has been to automate symptom assessment by asking patients to directly respond to symptom questions with an electronic device. This speeds up data entry and allows for rapid analysis and presentation of findings to care providers [<a href="#rid178">178</a>]. To date, answers to electronic versions do not seem to differ from those to paper and pencil versions. Electronic implementation has made possible symptom assessment on a large scale across health networks [<a href="#rid179">179</a>] and the development of web-based systems [<a href="#rid180">180</a>] for patient self-reporting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Symptoms are common among patients receiving treatment for advanced cancer, but they may be undetected by clinicians. The benefits of enhanced symptom monitoring during routine cancer care using web-based systems to facilitate patient-reported outcomes was shown in a seminal study in which 766 patients receiving active treatment for cancer were randomly assigned to a web-based tool to report 12 common symptoms between visits (which were then shared with nurses if participants reported severe or worsening symptoms) or to usual care at the discretion of the clinician [<a href="#rid181">181,182</a>]. Health-related quality of life improved in more participants in the intervention group (34 versus 18 percent) and worsened in fewer (38 versus 53 percent) [<a href="#rid181">181</a>]. Self-reporting patients had fewer admissions through the emergency department (34 versus 41 percent) and remained on chemotherapy longer (mean 8.2 versus 6.3 months). Patients who self-reported outcomes during treatment also lived significantly longer than did those receiving usual care (31 versus 26 months, p = 0.03) [<a href="#rid182">182</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moving palliative care upstream – Symptom assessment can be adopted to monitor adverse events during cancer chemotherapy administration for cancer patients. In a single-institution, randomized, controlled trial that compared electronic symptom reporting and monitoring with usual care in patients receiving nonprotocol chemotherapy for metastatic cancer, benefits of electronic symptom reporting were seen in quality of life, emergency department admissions [<a href="#rid181">181</a>], and survival [<a href="#rid182">182</a>]. In other studies where interventions do not follow upon the receipt of an alert, no changes have been seen in quality of life [<a href="#rid183">183</a>]. Ambulatory oncology clinics are another setting where symptom assessment is being implemented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Development of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) – Adverse event reporting is a critical part of the clinical trials system. A patient-reported-outcome-based adverse event reporting system for clinical trials that will supplement the standard adverse event manual has been developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) [<a href="#rid184">184</a>] and validated for adults [<a href="#rid185">185</a>] and in pediatrics [<a href="#rid186">186,187</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Importantly, symptom assessments, whether derived electronically or by patient report, rely upon the willingness of health care professionals to use the findings. This is a potential barrier that is now beginning to receive more attention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In Ontario, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) is completed before each visit. In a review of charts at a Canadian regional cancer center, as ESAS pain severity scores increased, the number of patients who received a pain intervention increased; 37 percent of patients with severe pain had a pain intervention. However, the clinical context was unclear [<a href="#rid188">188</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In another survey of cancer professionals in Ontario, the ESAS screening results were viewed always or frequently by 79 percent of physicians, 89 percent of nurses, 66 percent of psychosocial staff, and 29 percent of radiotherapists.

In another approach, called measurement-based practice, measurements from symptom assessment instruments administered across the system are used by practitioners to assess and set goals for individual patients [<a href="#rid191">191</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptom assessment instrument utilization and symptom reports as a measure of palliative care quality.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptom burden as an explanatory variable for how the totality of symptoms can influence or are related to other aspects of patient experience [<a href="#rid192">192</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptom trajectories over time as a descriptive, predictive, or explanatory variable [<a href="#rid64">64</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptom clusters – The co-occurrence of symptoms with an increased frequency is the underlying concept for symptom clusters, which has the potential for grouping or simplifying the many symptoms that can be reported by patients [<a href="#rid193">193</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1616173758"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
