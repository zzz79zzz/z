         Infants who present with a history of an acute event (an unexpected change in an infant's breathing, appearance, or behavior), reported by their parent or caregiver, represent a heterogeneous group of patients of varying ages with diverse pathophysiology. It is not a specific diagnosis, but rather a "chief complaint" that brings an infant to medical attention. The clinical challenge is to identify the infants who may benefit from further testing and prolonged observation, based on factors that suggest an identifiable underlying diagnosis or risk for subsequent events, while avoiding unnecessary testing, monitoring, and hospital admission for the many other infants without these characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, these events were termed "apparent life-threatening events" (ALTE). This term was broad and included a wide range of events and prognoses. Other previously used terms were "near-miss sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)" or "aborted crib deaths," which were discarded because they incorrectly implied a direct association between these symptoms and SIDS [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A majority of these events are more precisely described as a "brief resolved unexplained event" (BRUE). This term was defined by consensus in 2016 and should be used instead of ALTE whenever the event is transient and remains unexplained after an appropriate medical evaluation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Most but not all infants with BRUE are at low risk for recurrence or for having a serious underlying problem [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the diverse presentations, causes, and prognoses of infants presenting with acute events, evaluation and management should be individualized. This topic review outlines the primary diagnostic considerations and a stepwise plan for evaluating infants presenting with this chief complaint.

         BRUE is not a specific diagnosis but a description of a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode in an infant that includes one or more of the following features  (

         Infants who meet all of these criteria for low-risk BRUE after a focused history and physical examination require minimal additional evaluation or observation (see

         Apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) is a broader term that may include prolonged events or those that are explained by an underlying disorder. The term BRUE should be used instead of ALTE whenever possible (ie, when episodes are brief, resolved, and unexplained). For events that do not fit the definition of BRUE, guidelines encourage the use of event characteristics rather than the term "ALTE" to describe the event [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In this topic review, we will use ALTE when describing literature that used the broader definition, and "acute event" for the chief complaint prior to determination of whether it meets the definition of BRUE.

         </span>
         Estimates of the incidence of BRUE in infants are not available, because most available studies focused on the broader and imprecisely defined category of apparent life-threatening event (ALTE); such studies estimated that ALTEs occur in 3:10,000 to 41:10,000 infants [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-12
         </a>
         ]. The wide range of prevalence probably represents different stringencies in the definition of ALTE and different case-finding strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The main risk factors for acute events in infants described as BRUE or ALTE are feeding difficulties, recent upper respiratory symptoms, and age younger than two months, or a history of previous episodes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,9,13
         </a>
         ]. Lesser risk factors include premature birth or low birth weight and maternal smoking [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Some studies also report that the rate of ALTE is higher among postmature infants or first-born infants, as compared with the general population [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In older studies focusing on the broad category of ALTE, the most commonly identified explanatory diagnoses included gastroesophageal reflux, neurologic problems (such as seizures), and respiratory infection [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, it is likely that the distribution of explanatory diagnoses will change with implementation of the narrower diagnostic category BRUE [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>

         The initial evaluation of an infant who has experienced BRUE is a focused history and physical examination. This information helps to identify infants who are at low risk for having a serious underlying disorder  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108136" href="/z/d/graphic/108136.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ); such infants require minimal additional work-up or observation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of low-risk BRUE'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The history and physical examination may also identify features that suggest a specific cause of the event (eg, choking/laryngospasm or an upper respiratory tract infection) or characteristics that suggest a higher risk for having a serious underlying disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51356" href="/z/d/graphic/51356.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The clinical evaluation is supplemented by targeted testing in selected patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of the focused history and physical examination was illustrated in a series of infants admitted to a tertiary center with apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). The cause of the event was diagnosed on the basis of the history and physical examination alone in 21 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The diagnosis was confirmed with testing prompted by the history and physical examination in an additional 49 percent. Eighteen percent of all tests ordered were positive and only 6 percent contributed to the diagnosis.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The most important diagnostic tool is a detailed description of the event and intervention obtained from the caretaker who witnessed the episode and any emergency personnel involved in the case. The key elements in the history are summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54418" href="/z/d/graphic/54418.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The history should include information about any previous apneic events, recent illnesses or symptoms, the pregnancy and perinatal period, the infant's usual behavior, sleep and feeding habits, a family history (including a history of siblings with similar episodes, sudden deaths, early deaths, genetic, metabolic, cardiac, and neurologic problems), a social history (including the presence of smoking, alcohol or substance use in the home, and a list of medications in the home) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The family should be asked specifically about the possibility of accidental or intentional administration of poisons or medications, including over-the-counter cold preparations [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Features that suggest that the event was caused by gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and/or laryngospasm include gross emesis or oral regurgitation that occurred at the time of the event, and that the episode was characterized by obstructive apnea (ie, that the infant was making respiratory efforts but not successfully breathing). Acute events caused by laryngospasm typically occur during feeding, or shortly after feeding, especially if the infant is in a supine position. In an otherwise healthy infant, the presence of these features is reassuring because they suggest that the event was caused by choking, gagging, and/or laryngospasm, which are common and not life-threatening. If the events are recurrent and/or the infant has underlying neurologic or developmental abnormalities, further evaluation for swallowing dysfunction may be warranted. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Gastroesophageal reflux or swallowing dysfunction'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A respiratory tract infection should be suspected based on symptoms (eg, history of nasal congestion, cough, and/or fever). Features suggestive of seizures include loss of muscle tone and unresponsiveness during the episode, and no history of choking or gagging. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Respiratory infection'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Epilepsy or central nervous system disorder'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A history of previous episodes of severe events should particularly prompt consideration of child abuse, especially if the events occurred in the presence of a single caretaker and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A history of acute events or unexplained death in siblings or a prior report for child maltreatment also raises this concern. Child abuse may involve intentional suffocation, abusive head trauma, or factitious illness. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Child abuse'

         Testing for pertussis (especially for infants with suggestive symptoms). Respiratory virus testing, such as for respiratory syncytial virus, is reasonable if a rapid testing method is available. However, this testing is not required in these low-risk infants, who by definition have no respiratory symptoms and are &gt;2 months of age. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
         In particular, the clinician should educate the family that there is no known association between BRUE (with low-risk characteristics) and the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It is reasonable to use this opportunity to remind the family of the routine measures that they should take to minimize the risk of SIDS, such as ensuring that the infant sleeps in a supine position with face free, and in a safe sleeping environment (avoiding adult or loose bedding, excessive clothing, extreme room temperatures), and eliminating prenatal and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Parents and caregivers should be specifically advised not to shake the infant in an effort to "resuscitate" him or her [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         For these low-risk infants, there is
         <strong>
          no need
         </strong>
         for routine testing with a urinalysis, blood tests (glucose, bicarbonate, or lactic acid), or neuroimaging, or admission to the hospital solely for cardiorespiratory monitoring [

         The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline specifically
         <strong>
          recommends against
         </strong>
         evaluating for systemic infection (white blood cell count, blood culture, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis or culture); laboratory testing for anemia; metabolic disease (electrolytes, calcium, ammonia, urine organic acids, plasma amino acids or acylcarnitines); respiratory disease (chest radiograph or blood gas testing); echocardiogram; electroencephalogram (EEG); or studies for gastroesophageal reflux (GER) [

         Most infants presenting with BRUE fail to meet all of the low-risk criteria. In a large multicenter study, 87 percent had one or more high-risk characteristics [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The BRUE criteria were reasonably accurate for predicting a recurrent event in the emergency department or hospital (negative predictive value [NPV] 97 percent, positive predictive value [PPV] 14 percent) but less accurate for identifying the small minority with a serious underlying condition (NPV 97 percent, PPV 4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The most common serious underlying causes were epilepsy/infantile spasms, airway abnormalities, and abusive head trauma. Because of the small but important risk of serious underlying causes, the complaint must be taken seriously even if the infant appears entirely well by the time they are evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although this large retrospective study provides insights into the spectrum of presentations and outcomes of infants presenting to emergency departments with a potential BRUE, the methodology does not allow a full assessment evaluation of the performance of the BRUE risk criteria or algorithm as used prospectively in practice.

         Among infants presenting with acute events (using the broad definition of ALTE), a specific cause can be identified in more than 50 percent after a careful history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory evaluation  (

         Infants with upper respiratory symptoms (cough, nasal congestion) or those who are young (&lt;60 days) or premature should be evaluated for respiratory infections, particularly pertussis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. An upper or lower respiratory tract infection (including bronchiolitis) is ultimately diagnosed in approximately 20 percent of infants with acute events [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15,33

         Testing for pertussis is especially appropriate if the infant has any upper respiratory symptoms or if there is pertussis activity in the community. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen by polymerase chain reaction is typically used because it provides results promptly. (See

         Testing for respiratory viruses (eg, RSV) is reasonable in infants with nasal congestion or other respiratory symptoms. Respiratory symptoms may be subtle (coryza), especially in young or premature infants. RSV has been associated with apnea in premature infants or those &lt;60 days old, but such infants are by definition not in the low-risk category for BRUE. (See

         If the history or examination raises any concerns about child abuse, a thorough evaluation is warranted. This possibility should be particularly considered if the child has unexplained bruising or bleeding, a bulging fontanelle with or without recurrent vomiting and irritability, if the caretaker gives inconsistent or implausible descriptions of the event, or if there have been previous events that take place only in the presence of a single caretaker (especially severe events requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]), or siblings with unexplained events or deaths  (

         The evaluation may include radiographic evaluation for trauma, neuroimaging, social work screening, and/or hospitalization for observation and further assessment. To evaluate for retinal hemorrhage, a limited funduscopic examination can be performed using a direct ophthalmoscope with pupillary dilation, but this approach has low sensitivity. A definitive examination for retinal hemorrhage requires indirect ophthalmoscopy by an ophthalmologist and may require anesthesia. We also suggest querying the local child protection register to determine whether any relevant complaints have been recorded [

         Transient choking or gagging during feeding can lead to an acute event in healthy infants and usually is benign. The likely mechanism is laryngospasm. Similarly, physiologic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) can cause laryngospasm and BRUE in healthy infants. The GER may have triggered the laryngospasm, but this does not mean that the infant has an abnormal degree of GER or that treatment of GER will prevent similar events in the future [
         <a href="#rid35">

         In infants with these characteristics who are otherwise healthy, low-risk medical interventions to reduce GER (eg, thickening of feeds, trial of a milk-free diet, and possibly acid suppression) may be used, but these interventions should not replace or delay an evaluation for other causes of acute events, especially in infants with warning signs that suggest a serious cause of the event [

         <a class="local">
          'Warning signs'
         </a>
         above). Because a causal association between GER and acute events rarely is established with certainty, and because the overall risk for death in these infants is low, invasive approaches such as antireflux surgery are rarely appropriate for this type of patient. (See

         For infants with a history of recurrent difficulties while feeding (eg, observations of choking or repeated acute events), a videofluoroscopic swallowing study may be useful to evaluate for swallowing dysfunction. Infants with neurologic dysfunction, dysmorphic features, or known syndromes are at increased risk for swallowing dysfunction. (See

         Esophageal pH monitoring or multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring is of limited value in evaluating infants with BRUE and suspected GER [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Abnormal results of esophageal monitoring do not confirm that GER caused the acute event, and normal results do not exclude GER as a cause. The test can only establish a causal association between GER and the acute event if another event occurs during the 24-hour monitoring period, and if the event is demonstrated to be temporally associated with a preceding episode of GER by using simultaneous polysomnography or continuous oxygen saturation monitoring.

         An evaluation for seizures (electroencephalogram [EEG] and/or brain imaging) is warranted only if there is a strong clinical suspicion. This is because these tests have low sensitivity to predict which patients will ultimately be diagnosed with chronic epilepsy [

          6,38

        <p>
         In several case series, a CNS disorder was ultimately diagnosed in 10 to 20 percent of infants who presented with an ALTE [

In addition, serious underlying medical conditions (eg, hypoventilation or hypoxemia) may become apparent [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24,43
         </a>
         ]. As an example, observations of apnea or bradycardia in association with clinical findings of inadequate respiratory effort, color change, or loss of tone will confirm the need for more specialized diagnostic studies (eg, extended Holter monitoring, esophageal pH monitoring, epilepsy monitoring, polysomnography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the CNS, metabolic studies, or more invasive studies such as bronchoscopy).

         The diverse characteristics of infants with a history of an acute event preclude universal policies regarding the use of home cardiorespiratory (CR) monitoring. The decision should be made on a case-by-case basis after considering with the family the potential benefits, uncertainties, and stresses involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies of infants with a history of ALTE and who remain asymptomatic have failed to demonstrate a therapeutic benefit of home CR monitoring. Nonetheless, in selected cases, monitor recordings may provide some diagnostic value or may provide reassurance that clinically important events are not occurring. Infants who may particularly benefit from home monitoring include premature infants with recurrent episodes of apnea and bradycardia, or infants with unstable airways or chronic lung disease. Providers and families should recognize that home monitors typically detect only chest wall movement and heart rate. For some infants, particularly those in whom obstructive apnea is suspected, monitoring oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be more appropriate than CR monitoring. These issues are discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See

         For infants meeting the narrow criteria for BRUE (ie, was brief, resolved completely, and no explanation is found after a focused evaluation), the risk of recurrence is less than 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">

         In a study of infants with BRUE that led to hospitalization, 65 percent had subsequent choking spells reported by caregivers, 10 percent had subsequent BRUE spells, and 15 percent had repeat emergency department visits or hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

         In studies of infants meeting historical criteria for apparent life-threatening events (ALTE), reported recurrence rates ranged from 10 to 25 percent [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,14,45-47

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk factors for clinically significant recurrences include prematurity (postmenstrual age &lt;43 weeks), a history of multiple events preceding the hospital admission, event duration &gt;1 minute, and a viral respiratory tract infection [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,48,49
         </a>
         ]. Although upper respiratory tract symptoms are associated with recurrent events, one series suggests that these events are not likely to be serious as long as the initial event was not severe and there were no other warning signs [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Apneic events that occur in infants with a history of prematurity usually represent an immaturity of respiratory control and generally resolve with maturation. In a longitudinal study that used home monitoring, preterm infants were at increased risk for "extreme" alarm events (defined as central apnea lasting more than 30 seconds, or extreme bradycardia or oxygen desaturation &lt;80 percent lasting more than 10 seconds), and these events disappeared once the infants reached 43 weeks postconceptional age [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Infants who present with multiple acute events preceding the hospital admission are more likely to have an underlying disease as compared with those with single events. This may include an acute infection (viral illness or serious bacterial infection), metabolic disorder, or child abuse [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Whether the age of the infant predicts recurrence is unclear. Infants younger than two months of age require special attention because they are at increased risk for occult infection or undiagnosed congenital disorders [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,50
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, acute events are uncommon after three months of age, so older infants are more likely to have an underlying cause (eg, seizure or child abuse) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,27

         The overall risk of subsequent death in infants who have experienced ALTE is estimated to be less than 1 percent, and substantially lower for those meeting the narrower criteria for BRUE [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,29,30,51,52
         </a>
         ]. Among infants who initially present with an ALTE and subsequently die, most have a specific cause for death. Causes of death may include child abuse, an underlying neurologic disorder, pneumonia, or metabolic disease [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,29,30,53
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain risk factors are associated with a greater mortality risk. Infants with recurrent events requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have a very high risk of subsequent death, ranging from 10 to 30 percent [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54,55
         </a>
         ]. In such infants, unusual diagnoses, including metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative problems, or intentional suffocation, should be considered. Infants subjected to child abuse presenting as BRUE-like events also have an increased mortality rate (9 percent in one case series [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, ALTE was thought to be a possible precursor to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) because prior ALTE events were reported in 5 percent of SIDS victims [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ], and because early anecdotal reports described SIDS in infants with recurrent apnea [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. However, the vast majority of SIDS victims do not experience acute events or apnea prior to death. Furthermore, studies over the past two decades have failed to confirm a causal relationship between preexisting apnea and SIDS [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Over 80 percent of SIDS deaths occur between midnight and 6 AM [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ], whereas 82 percent of ALTE episodes occur between 8 AM and 8 PM [

         Interventions to prevent SIDS (eg, supine sleeping) have not resulted in a decreased incidence of ALTE [

         </span>
         The risk factors for SIDS and ALTE differ [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,48
         </a>
         ]. In one prospective population-based study, prone sleeping, lack of breastfeeding, and maternal smoking were risks for SIDS, whereas behavioral characteristics (eg, previous episodes of apnea, pallor, cyanosis, or feeding difficulties) were risk factors for ALTE [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Prematurity and low birth weight are much stronger risk factors for SIDS than for ALTE [
         <a href="#rid13">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, ALTE is unlikely to be a predictor of SIDS because ALTE refers to a heterogeneous group of problems with different causes and severities, ranging from benign to near-fatal. Moreover, the case definition in ALTE (or BRUE) depends upon observations by the parent or caregiver, which have been shown to be unreliable in several studies [

The term BRUE should be used instead of ALTE whenever possible (ie, when episodes are brief, resolved, and unexplained). For events that do not fit the definition of BRUE, guidelines encourage the use of event characteristics rather than the term ALTE to describe the event. (See

          Further evaluation
         </strong>
         – Infants with warning signs or those who do not meet low-risk criteria warrant further evaluation, which typically includes a basic screening evaluation. Further work-up depends upon the suspected disorder  (

          algorithm 2

         ). In some cases, the history and physical examination may identify features that suggest a specific cause of the event (eg, choking/laryngospasm or an upper respiratory tract infection) or other characteristics that suggest a higher risk for having a serious underlying disease  (

         The role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in infants with acute events is uncertain. When an episode of GER appears to have immediately preceded the acute event, the direct cause of the respiratory event is probably laryngospasm. The GER may have triggered the laryngospasm, but this does not mean that the infant has an abnormal degree of GER or that treatment of reflux will prevent similar events in the future. Laryngospasm also may occur during feeding in the absence of GER. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Gastroesophageal reflux or swallowing dysfunction'

         The possibility of child abuse should be considered when an infant suffers recurrent, severe BRUE-like events requiring CPR that occur only in the presence of a single caretaker and a thorough diagnostic evaluation reveals no reasonable explanation for these dramatic repetitive events. These and other clues on history and physical examination are outlined in the tables  (

         <strong>
          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – Approximately 4 percent of infants presenting with BRUE have a serious underlying cause. BRUE and ALTEs are not considered a precursor to, or risk factor for, SIDS. The vast majority of SIDS victims do not experience apnea prior to death, and the epidemiology and risk factors for SIDS are very different from those for BRUE and ALTE. (See
