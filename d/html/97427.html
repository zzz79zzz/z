         For patients with a broad range of serious life-threatening illness, loss of function and independence is a common struggle and a significant contributor to diminished quality of life (QOL) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Rehabilitation, even in the advanced phases of an illness, can help to maintain or restore function, permit patients to retain mobility and independence, and improve symptoms, all of which can contribute to a reduced burden on families and caregivers as well as better QOL [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The main rehabilitation modalities are physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and swallowing rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of palliative care patients requires a multidimensional approach to meet the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. All members of the interdisciplinary team should work toward common goals, which are dependent on the patient’s preferences and goals of care.

          OVERVIEW OF REHABILITATION IN PALLIATIVE CARE

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         Rehabilitation in palliative care is often overlooked. However, patients with a serious life-threatening illness experience high levels of functional loss, with increased dependency for their activities of daily living (ADLs) and mobility. Among the factors that can contribute to loss of function are prolonged hospitalization, deconditioning, pain, fatigue, depression, undernutrition, organ failure (eg, heart failure), neurologic injury, and musculoskeletal problems. Patients with cancer can additionally experience sarcopenia from direct tumor effects and fatigue from cancer treatment [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,6-13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Progressive debility, decline of physical function, and the perception of being a burden to others can have a major impact on most aspects of life in a palliative care patient [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]; for some, it may prompt the desire for a hastened death and requests for physician-assisted death [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of the physical and functional impairments that arise in these patients are potentially modifiable through physical therapy and rehabilitation, yet these services are typically underutilized [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. A 2020 cross-sectional study in Denmark showed that 64 percent of patients with chronic advanced diseases (n = 67) reported extensive unmet needs concerning physical activities, work and daily activities, fatigue, pain, concentration, and worries that could potentially be alleviated with an integrated palliative rehabilitation program [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Underutilization of rehabilitation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The concept of rehabilitation in patients with palliative needs would seem to be a paradox, but in reality rehabilitation is highly appropriate for patients with complex, progressive illness, depending on the patient’s goals. While palliative care and rehabilitation share a commitment to improve overall quality of life (QOL) and multidisciplinary treatment, there are clear differences between rehabilitation in palliative care and the traditional rehabilitation approach within general medical care [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         ]:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For patients without life-limiting or serious illness, rehabilitation is generally performed for a disability that has occurred at one point in time, and there is an expectation that further deterioration is unlikely. The aim of traditional rehabilitation is to maximize recovery, and the emphasis is on physical needs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16852.html" rel="external">
          "Geriatric rehabilitation interventions"

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         By contrast, patients with life-limiting or serious illness may not only have a disability but they also have a condition where further deterioration is not only likely, but inevitable. The scope of rehabilitation in this context goes beyond physical needs and emphasizes a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to management of all symptoms, whether physical, spiritual, or emotional. The goals are to reach the fullest physical, psychological, social, vocational, and educational potential consistent with the patients’ physiological or anatomical impairment in the context of environmental limitations, preferences, and goals of care, to maintain the highest possible QOL, and enable individuals to cope and manage their illness [

         The main rehabilitation modalities are physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and swallowing therapy, each provided by specialists in their field. However, rehabilitation of palliative care patients requires a multidimensional approach that also addresses the emotional, social, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. As a result, rehabilitation in the palliative care context includes psychologists, dieticians, nurses, chaplains, and case managers/social workers as well. All members of the interdisciplinary team should work toward common goals, which are defined by the patient’s preferences and goals of care.

         ]. Even at the very end of life as the disease advances to its terminal phase, it is still possible to perform rehabilitative interventions at the patient’s bedside such as range-of-motion exercises for patients’ limbs, massage for swollen limbs, or patient positioning to relieve cough or dyspnea.

         </span>
         Regular and open communication with patients and their families regarding the goals of rehabilitation is critical in designing the rehabilitation plan. Even in the advanced phases of a disease, rehabilitation can help maintain function or slow down functional decline and improve mobility and ability to perform ADLs through such means as strengthening, ambulation, range-of-motion exercises, and relief of pain and other symptoms [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. However, deciding upon appropriate goals for rehabilitation during the advanced stage of disease (particularly for patients with advanced terminal cancer) requires interaction among patients, families, and rehabilitation staff so that realistic goals can be identified in the context of the disease trajectory and the patient’s goals and wishes for care. The rehabilitation plan must also consider the patient’s environment, existing functionality, and available resources. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95552.html" rel="external">
          "Discussing goals of care"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point is that for palliative care patients, the measure of success of a rehabilitation program should not focus on length of survival but rather on QOL, function/independence, and psychosocial wellbeing [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Objective outcome measures of rehabilitation in palliative care patients may involve patient-reported parameters, such as improvement in mobility, pain scores, anxiety levels, and satisfaction with care as well as caregiver-related outcomes, such as caregiver burden and QOL.
        </p>
        <p>
         It must also be emphasized that these are patients with serious life-threatening illnesses, and patient condition and goals of care can shift dramatically from day to day. Fluctuations in functional status are therefore expected, and therapists must maintain some flexibility allowing for respect for patient choices and for frequent interruptions in the rehabilitation treatment plan. During each session, rehabilitation therapists should reassess and reevaluate each patient and modify/adapt treatment plans as needed.

         There is a growing body of evidence that the application of rehabilitation in hospice and palliative care settings is feasible, safe, and provides numerous benefits, both with cancer and non-cancer patients [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,25,26
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review of 13 studies (one randomized trial, three prospective single-armed studies of physical therapy interventions, and nine retrospective case series examining the utilization and benefits of physical therapy) examined the benefits of physical therapy interventions (mostly strengthening/therapeutic exercises, education, balance and fall-prevention training, and transfer training) in patients with a variety of life-threatening illnesses [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         Some of the most common indications for rehabilitation in patients with advanced cancer are refractory pain, fatigue, dyspnea, deconditioning after a prolonged hospitalization, and the need to recover from disabilities (eg, swallowing disorders) that have resulted from the effects of the cancer or its treatment. Often, cancer patients are referred to rehabilitation services in order to improve their performance status and eligibility for additional treatment. Many of these conditions are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Rehabilitative and physical modalities used to manage cancer pain can generally be grouped into four categories: nociceptive modulators, stabilization or unloading strategies on painful structures, modalities with physiologic effects that indirectly influence nociception, and rehabilitation approaches to manage musculoskeletal pain. Examples include electrical stimulation, heat and cold, counterstimulation and desensitization techniques, orthotics, therapeutic exercises, positioning, light and laser therapies, manual lymphatic drainage, deep heat modalities, RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation), myofascial release techniques and trigger points, and massage [

         Retrospective series, a small number of uncontrolled prospective studies comparing outcomes pre- and post-rehabilitation intervention, and a few randomized trials show that general rehabilitation can improve function and QOL and reduce symptom burden (without worsening fatigue) in patients with cancer, even if the illness is at an advanced stage [

In addition to enabling independence in ADLs despite physiologic and anatomic restrictions, and reducing the sense of being a burden to one’s caregivers, therapeutic interventions such as physical therapy may also be perceived as giving patients hope and a feeling of relief and general wellbeing [

         A landmark 1994 study of 301 terminal cancer patients who received rehabilitative services in the hospice facility over a six-month period prior to death concluded that rehabilitation (which included therapeutic exercise, ADL training, bed exercises, bed training, chest physiotherapy, swallowing exercises, thermotherapy, intermittent pneumatic compression, acupuncture, relaxed positioning with pillows, and use of brace, sling, and splints) was associated with improved QOL, mobility, and symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, and leg edema [

The patients underwent a three-hour initial assessment in which they met with each member of the team (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, dietician, nurse, and physician) for approximately 30 minutes. After the initial assessments, the team jointly formulated an individualized plan for each patient which included medical and nursing assessments, physical exercise, and occupational, dietary, and psychosocial interventions. Measures of physical, nutritional, social, and psychological functioning were evaluated at entry into the program and at completion. For the patients who completed eight weeks of palliative rehabilitation, there were significant improvements across multiple outcomes, including nutrition, depression, overall wellbeing, fatigue, general activity, and functional measures, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, the Timed Up and Go test, functional reach test, Berg Balance test, grip strength, and walking  (

         Few randomized trials have explored the benefit of rehabilitation in cancer patients. A systematic review including 13 randomized trials published between 2009 and 2014 (1169 participants) evaluated the benefits of general rehabilitation among patients with advanced cancer; seven were limited to physical exercise alone [

         Several trials indicate that physiotherapy can reduce cancer-related fatigue [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44-47

          44
         </a>
         ] included 60 advanced cancer patients (n = 60), one-half of which received a dedicated physiotherapy program and the other one-half of which served as the control (not receiving any physiotherapy). The 30-minute physiotherapy sessions conducted three times per week over a two-week period included active therapeutic exercises of the upper and lower limbs, selected techniques of myofascial release, and selected techniques of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). To maintain standardization, the sessions were conducted by one physical therapist who was trained and licensed in both myofascial release and PNF techniques. The intervention group had a significant reduction in the severity of fatigue and its impact on daily functioning. Moreover, the physiotherapy program improved the patients’ overall sense of wellbeing and reduced the intensity of coexisting symptoms, such as pain, drowsiness, anorexia, and depression. The subject of physiotherapy in patients with cancer-related fatigue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         ]. Patients were randomized to either a regimen of outpatient physical and occupational therapy with close follow-up or to usual care without mandatory rehabilitation services. The primary outcome was functional status as measured by the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale. Secondary outcomes were: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Global Mental and Physical Health (GMH, GPH), ability to participate in Social Roles (SR), physical function, and activity expectations and self-efficacy (Possibilities for Activity Scale [PActS]). Though statistical significance was not reached for the PActS, results showed that occupational and physical therapy services may positively influence activity expectations and self-efficacy. Future research is needed to address significant barriers to implementation of these services and access to quality care.

         A variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including ALS, dementia, and Parkinson disease and other movement disorders, are characterized by progressive and inexorable loss of neurologic function, which usually culminates in loss of mobility and independence. Patients with progressive neurologic disease could benefit from a multidisciplinary palliative care team approach that includes physiotherapists and other rehabilitation specialists to mitigate symptom burden while improving functional capacity and self-sufficiency [

          ALS
         </strong>
         – ALS is a progressive and degenerative neurologic disease affecting motor neurons disrupting muscle control characterized by lower motor neuron defects (muscle atrophy, axial muscle weakness, respiratory muscle weakness, loss of arm strength and dexterity, weakness of speech and swallowing) and upper motor neuron loss (incoordination). On top of their motor impairment, patients have high burdens of pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and sialorrhea. The natural history of ALS is characterized by a relentlessly progressive course that is characterized by diffuse weakness and skeletal muscle wasting and is frequently accompanied by dysarthria, dysphagia, and failure of the muscles that support respiration. The main focus of palliative care as the disease progresses is proactive management of symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, and dysphagia.

         ALS centers have been developed to facilitate multidisciplinary care which includes rehabilitation at every phase of the illness [

The focus is to prolong and maintain independence, maximize QOL, and avoid complications. Over the spectrum of the disease’s natural history, patients can benefit from individualized rehabilitation interventions with the goal of optimizing independence, function, and safety [

         The benefits of a dedicated multidisciplinary team can be illustrated by a report from one hospital in Hong Kong where a special workgroup for motor neuron disease (MND) was created that included a neurologist, respiratory physician, rehabilitation specialist, and palliative care physician [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. In various phases of the disease, each specialist played a leading role in coordinated care. The aims of the group were to promote and implement best-practice interdisciplinary care, enable the dissemination of MND-specific information to other health professionals, and encourage the sharing of expertise in managing MND patients. Forty-one patients over a two-year period were cared for using this model. The symptoms being managed were limb weakness, dysphagia, pain, and depression. Rehabilitation specialists targeted assistance with ADL function, maintenance, and home modification and performed a liaison role between respiratory physicians for ventilator use and gastroenterologists for feeding issues. Overall, 96 percent of patients participated in advance care planning discussions, and 75 percent opted for “do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation and no intubation/mechanical ventilation.” The average duration of palliative care services was 118 days.

         It is often thought that physical therapy and rehabilitation are not cost-effective, particularly for patients approaching the end-stage phase of their illness.

         It is widely maintained that exercise and physical activity exacerbates fatigue; however, there is little, if any, evidence to support this assertion. In fact, several studies affirm the observation that physical exercise improves fatigue, even in dying patients, and that the provision of physical therapy does not worsen physical distress in patients with advanced cancer [

         Other potential risks of physical therapy include aggravation of pain from manipulation or exercise, straining bones with metastatic disease that have impending fractures, cardiovascular risk, and falls. The magnitude of these risks and how best to avoid them have not been systematically studied. However, individualization of the rehabilitation regimen, especially for patients with metastatic bone disease or central nervous system metastases, is essential to ensure the safety and appropriateness of the rehabilitation program.

         A thorough patient assessment for rehabilitation potential involves gathering information on disease location and stage, previous and current therapies, estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, pain and non-pain symptoms, medications, cognition, mood, nutritional status, and physical function. A complete physical examination with special attention to the neurologic and musculoskeletal system is essential to evaluate motor strength, sensory deficits, joint flexibility, gait pattern, and fall risk. An evaluation of the home environment, the availability of community resources, and financial resources should also be carried out [

         Using a systematized evaluation process will help to determine the patient’s current level of disability, previous level of functioning, and potential to regain function, which are all important components of rehabilitation planning. Ideally, patient evaluation and planning for rehabilitation should be performed by an interdisciplinary team led by a physiatrist experienced in hospice and palliative medicine along with clinicians specializing in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nursing, nutrition, psychology, respiratory therapy, recreation therapy, and case management.

         Settings for delivery of rehabilitation services for palliative care patients include the acute care hospital, freestanding rehabilitation hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient clinics, hospice settings (acute inpatient, long-term care, and home with hospice), and home. The intensity and scope of services differ across care settings, and the choice of the setting depends on a number of factors, including the type of illness, the overall disease course and the specific goals of care and wishes/preferences of the patient. In addition, similar to non-palliative care patients, the choice of the setting is dependent on medical stability, cognition, therapy tolerance and motivation, types of needed medical services, psychosocial factors, and, at least in the United States, insurance. Many of these issues, including issues related to reimbursement, are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See

         Inpatient rehabilitation facilities are dedicated, freestanding facilities designed for patients who have the potential for significant functional improvement or adaptation to permanent impairments within a prescribed period of time. There is emphasis on an intensive and coordinated interdisciplinary approach. Patients suitable for inpatient rehabilitation should be able to tolerate three hours of daily therapy five times per week and need active and ongoing rehabilitation intervention from multiple disciplines, at least one of which is physical therapy or occupational therapy. Inpatient rehabilitation programs are supervised by a rehabilitation physician (a physiatrist) with face-to-face visits at least three days per week. Acute inpatient rehabilitation is generally covered by Medicare Part A, Medicaid, and private insurers.

         Subacute rehabilitation, which is typically carried out in a skilled nursing facility with rehabilitation services, offers coordinated interdisciplinary services to patients who can tolerate at least one hour of therapy each day. Subacute rehabilitation may also serve as a transitional program prior to discharge from a medical or surgical unit, and for respite care.

         For patients in the United States, reimbursement issues must be considered. For patients covered by Medicare Part A in the United States, there are specific criteria for eligibility for subacute rehabilitation. The beneficiary must have been a hospital inpatient with a medically necessary stay of at least three consecutive calendar days; time spent in an emergency department or hospitalized with observation status does not count toward the qualifying three days. The beneficiary must also have been transferred to a participating skilled nursing facility within 30 days after discharge from the hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional criteria for a skilled nursing level of care must also apply, including that the patient requires skilled services on a daily basis. Skilled services include: medication management, catheter changes, or wound care.

Home-based rehabilitation is usually offered through home care and home hospice programs, and most can provide physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, social work, and skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis to home-confined patients who are not necessarily bedridden. Rehabilitation therapies are not offered on a daily basis, and the services provided are contingent upon the skilled need of the patient and the goals to be attained. A physician must certify a skilled nursing or rehabilitation need for eligible patients to help them recover from illness, injury, or an acute condition.

         Physical therapists can make recommendations for the type of equipment that patients may benefit from based upon their level and type of physical impairment. There are two types of devices: assistive and adaptive. Assistive equipment pertains to devices that may help with ambulation, mobility, balance, pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, joint instability, excessive skeletal loading, and elimination of weightbearing on an affected extremity (eg, crutches, canes, walkers, wheelchairs, scooters, lifts, ramps, and transfer boards). Adaptive equipment, on the other hand, pertains to devices used to improve performance in ADLs (eg, functional reachers, one-handed cutting boards, rocker knives, and sandwich holders for cooking and eating). Further discussion of specific assistive and adaptive devices, including reimbursement guidelines in the United States, is provided elsewhere. (See

         Physical therapists also provide recommendations for orthotic devices as appropriate for joint stability and safety, especially in patients with motor deficits. Examples include upper extremity orthotics to assist with manipulation of objects, lower extremity orthotics such as splints to promote joint stability and muscle function, and truncal orthotics for osseous instability. Phantom limb pain or stump pain may be ameliorated by a well-fitting prosthesis or the use of an assistive device such as a cane or walker to help in ambulation.

          98

         Physical therapists can often help put together a home exercise program for patients to follow at home. Therapeutic exercise comprises a range of techniques that can be applied in anatomical planes or as functional movement direction. The types of movement include active movement, assisted active movement, resistive movement, assisted-resistive active movement, and passive movement. Examples of therapeutic exercise techniques include relaxation, massage, muscle reeducation, floor aerobics, suspension therapy, progressive resisted exercise, breathing exercise, postural training, work simulation, work conditioning, work hardening, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation using facilitation and inhibition techniques, graded activity program, and cognitive behavioral training [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99

         ]. Therapeutic exercise may improve body mechanics through its beneficial effects on muscle strength, joint flexibility, range of motion, and balance. Reconditioning programs for patients with advanced illness such as cancer or other serious illnesses generally include graded aerobic and stretching exercises. Examples of equipment that promote aerobic exercise are treadmills, ergometers, and rowing machines.

         Discharge planning is an integral component of any rehabilitation program across various settings. This dynamic interdisciplinary process should consider the patient’s progress toward meeting the preestablished rehabilitation goals, whether goals of care that affect the decision to continue the rehabilitation program have changed, the degree of caregiver support needed after the rehabilitation program, or the setting in which the patient will receive subsequent care.

         In general, rehabilitation facilities have protocols in place for deciding whether and when patients will be discharged from their services. The most common reasons for discontinuation of services in both the inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation venues are as follows [

         Guidelines for discontinuation of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services are available from professional groups such as the American Physical Therapy Association [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104
         </a>
         ], the American Occupational Therapy Association [

         <a href="#rid102">
          102
         </a>
         ]. However, none of these guidelines specifically addresses indications for discontinuing services in palliative care patients, and they are of limited utility in this setting.

         For patients with a broad range of serious life-threatening illnesses, including advanced cancer, advanced heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, and chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), loss of function and independence is a common struggle and a significant contributor to diminished quality of life (QOL). Rehabilitation is an integral component of a holistic palliative care approach that enables people to maintain optimal levels of functioning regardless of life expectancy. Even in the advanced phases of an illness, rehabilitation can help patients retain mobility and independence and improve symptoms, all of which can contribute to a reduced burden on families and caregivers and better QOL [

         Rehabilitation of palliative care patients requires a multidimensional approach to meet the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. Teams are interdisciplinary and can include physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists as well as psychologists, dieticians, nurses, chaplains, and case managers/social workers.

         For patients in the palliative care setting, the goal of rehabilitation can differ depending on the patient’s preferences and values as well as their physical needs and the availability of social support. (See

         The application of rehabilitation in the hospice and palliative care settings is feasible, is safe, and provides numerous benefits, both with cancer and non-cancer diagnoses. For patients with cancer, rehabilitation can help manage refractory pain, fatigue, dyspnea, deconditioning after a prolonged hospitalization, and swallowing disorders resulting from the effects of the cancer or its treatment.

         Potential risks of rehabilitation include aggravation of pain and fatigue. The magnitude of these risks and how best to avoid them have not been systematically studied. Individualized decision-making about rehabilitation is required. (See

         A thorough patient assessment for rehabilitation potential involves gathering information on disease location and stage, previous and current therapies, estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, pain and non-pain symptoms, medications, cognition, mood, nutritional status, and physical function. A variety of functional assessment tools may be utilized to assess function during the planning process  (

         Settings for delivery of rehabilitation services to palliative care patients include the acute care hospital, freestanding rehabilitation hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient clinics, hospice units, and the home environment. The intensity and scope of services differ across care settings, and the choice of the setting depends on a number of factors, including the specific goals of care and wishes/preferences of the patient, therapy tolerance and motivation, the types of needed medical services, and, at least in the United States, reimbursement.

         Functional tasks that are appropriately addressed by physical therapy in a rehabilitative program include bed mobility, transfers, and ambulation/gait. Specific interventions utilized by physical therapy include physical modalities for pain control, provision of adaptive and assistive equipment, environmental modification, education on energy conservation/preservation, therapeutic exercises, and work simplification techniques.

         The occupational therapist screens for and monitors performance deficits to modify and meet the changing needs of palliative care patients. Functional tasks that are appropriately addressed by occupational therapy include self-care, transfers as they relate to activities of daily living (ADLs), and home management. (See

         The role of the speech-language pathologist is to provide consultation in the areas of communication, cognition, and swallowing function, to optimize the patient’s ability to communicate effectively, and to assist in optimizing function and patient satisfaction in a way that emphasizes the safest way to eat.
