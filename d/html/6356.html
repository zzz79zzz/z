The causes are presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206" href="/z/d/graphic/113206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>The causes of chronic cough in children will be reviewed here. The evaluation of a child with chronic cough should include a detailed history [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], physical examination, chest radiograph, and spirometry and follow a child-specific algorithm [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]; the clinical approach is summarized in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691" href="/z/d/graphic/113691.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) and discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6343.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic cough in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2981565065"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H966621986"><span class="h2">Chronic cough</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic cough in children aged 14 years and younger is typically defined as a cough lasting more than four weeks [<a href="#rid2">2,3,5</a>]. This definition is used by most published international guidelines (American, European, and Australian [<a href="#rid3">3,6-8</a>]) because most acute respiratory infections in children resolve within this interval and evaluation at four weeks permits relatively early diagnosis of serious underlying illnesses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6343.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic cough in children", section on 'Chronic cough'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2042171563"><span class="h2">Specific cough</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific cough refers to a chronic cough that is ultimately attributable to an underlying abnormality or disease, which is usually, but not always, of pulmonary origin  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206" href="/z/d/graphic/113206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In most cases of specific cough the initial evaluation will identify signs or symptoms suggesting the cause of the cough (known as "specific cough pointers"). These include symptoms such as wet cough or wheeze; timing, such as onset in neonatal period; associated conditions, such as failure to thrive or digital clubbing; abnormalities on chest radiograph or spirometry  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208" href="/z/d/graphic/113208.html" rel="external">table 2</a>); or classically recognizable cough sounds (eg, brassy or croup-like)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113265" href="/z/d/graphic/113265.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Many of these pointers are easily recognizable and are strong predictors of a specific cause. A specific cause of cough is very unlikely if no pointers are found on the initial evaluation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. One of the most important and discriminating pointers is presence of wet or productive cough [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. A chronic wet cough signifies the presence of airway secretions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and in most cases airway infection, and should not be ignored in children [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p>The main causes of specific cough are described in the remainder of this topic review.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3329694411"><span class="h2">Nonspecific cough</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conversely, "nonspecific" cough is defined as a chronic cough that does <strong>not</strong> have an identifiable cause after a reasonable evaluation including history, physical examination, radiography, and spirometry. A chronic cough is likely to be nonspecific if it is dry and there are no abnormalities identified on initial evaluation (ie, no "specific cough pointers"  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206" href="/z/d/graphic/113206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)). This type of cough usually resolves gradually, but children should be reevaluated periodically for the emergence of signs or symptoms of specific cough. In some cases, nonspecific cough may represent a postviral syndrome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H473721683"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF CAUSES IN CHILDREN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The three most common causes of chronic cough in children are asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), and nonspecific cough that resolves spontaneously, as described in hospital-based multicenter studies and a systematic review [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>] and supported by a multicenter study in which children were enrolled from primary care or emergency departments [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Other causes are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206" href="/z/d/graphic/113206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For some other diagnoses such as tuberculosis, the frequency varies by region [<a href="#rid13">13,16</a>].</p><p>Of note, the causes of chronic cough in children are different from that of adults, so evaluation and management of children should be based on child-specific protocols and not those designed for adults [<a href="#rid13">13,17</a>]. As an example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and upper airway cough syndrome (formerly known as postnasal drip syndrome) are thought to be common causes of chronic cough in adults but are probably not common causes in children [<a href="#rid13">13,18</a>]. Adult cough guidelines have suggested empirical treatment of asthma, GERD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) because these are the most common causes in this population. By contrast, pediatric guidelines do not recommend empiric therapy [<a href="#rid3">3,6,7</a>], although adolescents 15 years and older may be managed using guidelines for adults [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1460.html" rel="external">"Causes and epidemiology of subacute and chronic cough in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2609607663"><span class="h1">PULMONARY CAUSES OF CHRONIC COUGH IN CHILDREN</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2530204206"><span class="h2">Aspiration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic or recurrent aspiration is an uncommon but important cause of chronic cough. It may be due to a primary swallowing dysfunction or secondary to disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux or achalasia. Other risk factors for aspiration include neurologic and developmental abnormalities, neuromuscular disease, and anatomic airway abnormalities (eg, laryngeal cleft or tracheoesophageal fistula). Some individuals with these disorders have a history of feeding difficulties, or coughing during feeding. However, the absence of cough during swallowing does not exclude aspiration, because aspiration can be "silent," especially if it is chronic [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14537.html" rel="external">"Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6300.html" rel="external">"Congenital anomalies of the larynx"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3944935583"><span class="h2">Asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In some children, chronic cough can be the most prominent presenting symptom of asthma. However, isolated cough (cough in absence of other symptoms) is rarely asthma in children [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory symptoms</strong> – The cough associated with asthma is typically dry. A wet cough does not exclude asthma but should also raise the possibility of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) or aspirated foreign body (see <a class="local">'Protracted bacterial bronchitis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Inhaled retained airway foreign body'</a> below). Typically in asthma there are associated symptoms of wheezing, exertional dyspnea, or atopy, although these features may not be recognized or initially reported by the parents or caregivers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Asthma in the absence of any of these symptoms, sometimes termed "cough-dominant asthma," or "cough-variant asthma" may present as an apparently nonspecific cough. Most studies have suggested that this is an uncommon cause of cough in children [<a href="#rid7">7,17,23,24</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial in children with nonspecific cough showed no benefit from treatment with beta agonists and steroids [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Moreover, observational studies show that nonspecific cough has different risk factors and triggers than classic asthma and that nonspecific cough generally resolves spontaneously [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although cough-dominant asthma is probably uncommon in children, it is still appropriate to consider the possibility of asthma in a child presenting with a chronic dry cough and no other apparent symptoms, primarily because the presence or absence of wheezing is not reliably recognized by the parents or reported on history [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Therefore, evaluation for chronic cough in children should include careful questioning about clinical symptoms of wheezing or atopy, with spirometry and response to bronchodilators, and if warranted a trial of anti-asthma medications, as discussed below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> – Clues to the presence of asthma include a history of eczema, rhinitis, or bronchiolitis [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. A family history of atopy or asthma is common. In addition a history of wheeze and paroxysmal cough (that responds to bronchodilators) may be reported [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], although parental reporting of wheeze is often inaccurate [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Episodes of asthma are often triggered by acute upper respiratory viral illnesses, exercise, cold, or known allergens.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Initial evaluation of any child with chronic cough includes a chest radiograph and spirometry (if the child is able). The presence of bilateral hyperinflation on chest radiograph is often, although not always, indicative of asthma. In addition, changes within the right middle lobe are seen in children with asthma  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113200" href="/z/d/graphic/113200.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Spirometry (generally performed in children aged &gt;5 years) that shows an obstructive pattern on the flow volume loop, which reverses with bronchodilators, indicates obstructive airway disease, most commonly asthma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the initial evaluation suggests a provisional diagnosis of asthma, the next step is a trial of asthma medications (empiric trial of bronchodilators [short-acting beta-2 agonists] and low-dose inhaled corticosteroids) for two to four weeks, followed by reevaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691" href="/z/d/graphic/113691.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). A clear response to this therapy strongly supports the diagnosis of asthma, but does not fully establish the diagnosis, because nonspecific cough unrelated to asthma frequently resolves spontaneously. Therefore, asthma medication should not be continued unless the diagnosis of asthma can be made with confidence [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Lack of response to asthma medications generally is sufficient to exclude asthma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5742.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90904.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Overview of initiating therapy and monitoring control"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In cases where it is particularly difficult to establish or exclude the possibility of asthma, an airway hyperresponsiveness challenge test in the pulmonary laboratory may be indicated if the child is old enough for testing (≥5 years); this test is not always diagnostic [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5742.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis", section on 'Bronchoprovocation testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1374505933"><span class="h2">Chronic endobronchial suppurative disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic endobronchial suppurative disease represents a spectrum ranging from PBB, to chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD), to bronchiectasis.</p><p>While the relationship among these disorders has not been fully established, a pathobiologic model that has been proposed that suggests that PBB, CSLD, and bronchiectasis represent a spectrum of disease, with PBB at one end and irreversible bronchiectasis at the other. The model proposes that some children with PBB will progress to CSLD, then to bronchiectasis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115194" href="/z/d/graphic/115194.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>]. All three diseases have similar pathobiology with airway neutrophilia, neutrophilic inflammation (elevated matrix metallopeptidase 9 [MMP-9], interleukin 1 beta [IL1-beta], interleukin 8 [IL-8]) endobronchial infection with typical organisms and impaired mucociliary clearance and efferocytosis (removal of dying cells by macrophages) [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].</p><p>Support for this model comes from a prospective study of 194 children with PBB, which found that a small percentage of children with PBB (9.6 percent) developed bronchiectasis within five years [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Risk factors for development of bronchiectasis were recurrent episodes of PBB and nontypeable <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> infection. A subsequent study found alveolar macrophages from children with PBB or bronchiectasis demonstrated reduced ability to phagocytose apoptotic airway epithelial cells as well as nontypeable <em>H. influenzae</em>, suggesting that these two conditions have similar pathogenetic mechanisms [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2474017895"><span class="h3">Protracted bacterial bronchitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PBB is one of the most common causes of chronic wet cough, particularly in young children (&lt;5 years of age), accounting for approximately 40 percent of referrals to pediatric pulmonary specialist clinics in resource-abundant countries [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This disorder is now incorporated into American, Australian, and European cough guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3,6-8,36</a>]. Identification and treatment of PBB is important because, if untreated, it may be a precursor to bronchiectasis [<a href="#rid31">31,37,38</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Bronchiectasis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3572760612"><span class="h4">Diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PBB is usually diagnosed based on clinical criteria (termed "clinically-based PBB") [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic wet cough (duration at least four weeks)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No other symptoms or signs of other causes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No evidence of an alternative diagnosis after a standard evaluation (including normal spirometry and normal radiograph, other than bilateral peribronchial accentuation)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208" href="/z/d/graphic/113208.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resolution of the cough after a two-week course of appropriate antibiotics</p><p></p><p>PBB is caused by typical respiratory pathogens, such as <em>H. influenzae</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> [<a href="#rid17">17,32</a>]. Bronchoscopy is not required for the diagnosis but, if performed, reveals mucopurulent discharge in the bronchi  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115284" href="/z/d/graphic/115284.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). If bronchoscopy is performed and confirms clinically important density of bacteria in the lower airway, the term "microbiologically-based PBB" can be used to distinguish the diagnosis from clinically-based PBB [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>In some children the diagnostic criteria listed above are met but the disease is more severe. In these cases the term "PBB-extended" is used if the cough only resolves after an extended course (four weeks) of antibiotics; the term "recurrent PBB" is used when a child has more than three episodes per year [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1680935359"><span class="h4">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asthma – The clinical symptoms of PBB can be similar to asthma. Unlike asthma, PBB does not respond to bronchodilators and the cough is wet. However, asthma and PBB can coexist. If a child has a chronic wet cough and apparent asthma, but fails to respond to asthma medications, empiric treatment for PBB should be considered [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Foreign body – The symptoms of PBB may also be indistinguishable from foreign body aspiration. Young children are at risk for unrecognized foreign body aspiration, and should be evaluated if there are suspicious features, such as a history of sudden onset of cough after choking, or while eating or playing. (See <a class="local">'Inhaled retained airway foreign body'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bronchiectasis – Bronchiectasis may be associated with a previous or current respiratory infection or by other conditions that predispose to chronic lung infection, including immunodeficiency, anatomic abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, or primary ciliary dyskinesia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87712" href="/z/d/graphic/87712.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Evaluation for these disorders is warranted in a child who fails to respond to treatment (four weeks of appropriate antibiotics) or has recurrent episodes of PBB (&gt;3 in one year), growth faltering, or other pointers of specific cough [<a href="#rid32">32,38,39</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6358.html" rel="external">"Bronchiectasis in children: Pathophysiology and causes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4011614076"><span class="h4">Treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with a clinical diagnosis of PBB should be treated with a prolonged course of antibiotics, with a minimum course of two weeks [<a href="#rid7">7,40-42</a>]. In a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials including 190 children with chronic wet cough, treatment with antibiotics improved cough resolution compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] for persistent cough 0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.31).

If suspected, the medication should be withdrawn and the cough usually resolves.</p><p>Other medications can cause lung disease that results in chronic cough, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) with cytotoxic drugs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2299709872"><span class="h2">Causal role unlikely</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A preponderance of evidence suggests that gastroesophageal reflux and upper airway pathology are unlikely sole causes of chronic cough in children:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2858381471"><span class="h3">Esophageal disorders/gastroesophageal reflux</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rarely causes chronic cough in children, although some children with chronic cough have GERD. Most experts suggest that GERD is not a common cause of isolated chronic cough, except in children with neurologic abnormalities predisposing to aspiration [<a href="#rid13">13,15,18</a>]. This is supported by many prospective studies that report that GERD is not a common cause of cough in children, as summarized in a systematic review [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Data from ambulatory monitoring of esophageal pH also suggest that acid reflux is not a common cause of chronic cough. In one such study, more than 80 percent of coughs were independent of a reflux event and when the events coincided, reflux was no more likely to precede than to follow cough [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. There is somewhat better evidence to suggest a role for nonacid reflux in triggering chronic cough. In a few studies that used impedance manometry (a technique that can detect both acid and nonacid reflux), a temporal association between reflux events and some of the episodes of cough was noted in approximately 50 percent of children with chronic unexplained cough, suggesting a possible association in some individuals [<a href="#rid80">80-83</a>].</p><p>Therefore, GERD treatments should <strong>not</strong> be used in children &lt;14 years old with chronic cough when no clinical features of GERD are present, as stated in an expert-panel systematic review [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5892.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>For children with chronic cough and without underlying lung disease who do have gastrointestinal GERD symptoms (such as recurrent regurgitation, dystonic neck posturing in infants, and heartburn in older children), we suggest further investigation and treatment when appropriate, following current GERD guidelines for children [<a href="#rid85">85,86</a>]. Importantly, for these children with chronic cough and gastrointestinal GERD symptoms, it is recommended that a treatment trial of four to eight weeks of appropriate therapy be used, with reevaluation for response and cessation of therapy if there is no therapeutic benefit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3286913382"><span class="h3">Upper airway pathology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Upper airway disorders are probably not a cause of chronic cough in children; the main considerations are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)</strong> – UACS, also known as "postnasal drip," is probably an uncommon cause of chronic cough in children, although there is some controversy on this question [<a href="#rid13">13,18</a>]. In a systematic review, only two of the ten included studies reported that UACS was a common cause of cough in children; both of these studies were from Turkey [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. By contrast, UACS is thought to be a common cause of chronic cough in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1460.html" rel="external">"Causes and epidemiology of subacute and chronic cough in adults", section on 'Upper airway cough syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic rhinosinusitis</strong> – Similarly, chronic noninfectious rhinitis is probably not a common cause of cough in children, although it is a recognized cause of UACS in adults. Nonetheless, if a child has chronic cough and symptoms of a chronic noninfectious or allergic rhinitis (eg, because of chronic clear nasal drainage and boggy or edematous nasal mucosa), a trial of intranasal glucocorticoids is appropriate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7533.html" rel="external">"An overview of rhinitis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic sinusitis</strong> – Chronic sinusitis is not a common cause of chronic cough in children except in association with an immune defect predisposing to chronic infection [<a href="#rid7">7,13</a>]. Typical symptoms of chronic sinusitis are a thick and colored chronic nasal discharge. It is common practice to treat patients empirically with antibiotics, and in some cases both the discharge and cough improve with treatment. However, this response does not prove an association between sinusitis and cough. This is because patients with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) may present with identical symptoms, and would respond to antibiotics. Moreover, many other cases of chronic cough will improve or resolve over time regardless of the intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6069.html" rel="external">"Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)</strong> – No convincing evidence exists to suggest a clear relationship between OSA and chronic cough in children, although it is a reported cause in adults [<a href="#rid13">13,87</a>]. A prospective cohort study investigating children with chronic cough using a standardized chronic cough algorithm also evaluated for sleep-disordered breathing (including observed apneas in sleep, daytime somnolence, large tonsils) and found that a small number with OSA diagnosed on polysomnography had chronic cough that resolved with surgical treatment of their OSA [<a href="#rid88">88</a>].

"Specific cough" refers to a chronic cough that is ultimately attributable to an underlying abnormality or disease, which is usually, but not always, of pulmonary origin  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206" href="/z/d/graphic/113206.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Conversely, "nonspecific cough" is defined as a chronic cough that does not have an identifiable cause after a reasonable evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The evaluation of a child with chronic cough should include a detailed history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and spirometry (when possible in children aged &gt;5 years) using algorithmic approach  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691" href="/z/d/graphic/113691.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Signs and symptoms suggesting a specific cause of cough are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208" href="/z/d/graphic/113208.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). If the initial evaluation provides clues suggesting a specific cause of cough, further evaluation is focused on that diagnostic possibility. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6343.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic cough in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Major causes of chronic cough and initial management</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB)</strong> – PBB is a common cause of chronic cough in young children (&lt;5 years of age) in Australia, Europe, and similar populations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A provisional diagnosis of PBB can be made in a child presenting with chronic wet cough, no other symptoms, and no evidence of an alternative diagnosis (eg, retained airway foreign body or pneumonia) after a standard clinical evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Protracted bacterial bronchitis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with a provisional diagnosis of PBB, we suggest antibiotic therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Small, randomized trials have shown that, compared with placebo, antibiotics improve cough resolution in children with chronic wet cough. We typically treat with oral <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12639" href="/z/d/drug information/12639.html" rel="external">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> for <strong>two weeks</strong>. Alternatives include oral second- or third-generation cephalosporins, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12816" href="/z/d/drug information/12816.html" rel="external">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, or a macrolide. <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12937" href="/z/d/drug information/12937.html" rel="external">Azithromycin</a> should not be used in this setting, due to lack of demonstrated efficacy and concerns of inducing antibiotic-resistant organisms. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For children who continue to cough after two weeks of antibiotics, we suggest prolonging the course of antibiotics (up to four weeks) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). This is based on our clinical experience and a randomized trial that found that four weeks of treatment improved some but not all outcomes; further clinical trial data are required. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If a wet cough fails to improve after a four-week course of antibiotics, or if PBB recurs frequently (&gt;3 times in 12 months), the patient should be further evaluated for other causes, including a retained foreign body, congenital abnormalities, and bronchiectasis and its causative disorders such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and immune deficiencies. (See <a class="local">'Recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Bronchiectasis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Asthma</strong> – Asthma is a common cause of chronic cough in children of all ages, and the cough is typically dry, except if there is a concurrent respiratory infection. It usually is associated with symptoms of wheezing, but some children may have cough as their primary or only symptom of asthma. Therefore, evaluation for chronic cough in children should include careful questioning about clinical symptoms of exertional dyspnea, recurrent wheezing, or atopy, with spirometry and evaluation of response to bronchodilators. If the initial evaluation suggests a provisional diagnosis of asthma, the next step is a trial of asthma medications (empiric trial of bronchodilators [short-acting beta-2 agonists] and/or low-dose inhaled corticosteroids) for two to four weeks, followed by reevaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691" href="/z/d/graphic/113691.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Asthma medication should not be continued unless the diagnosis of asthma can be made with confidence. (See <a class="local">'Asthma'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Foreign body</strong> – The possibility of an inhaled foreign body should always be considered in young children with a chronic cough who have a history of sudden onset after a choking episode or began after eating or playing. These children should be evaluated with a chest radiograph as a first step but should also be referred to a specialist for evaluation and urgent bronchoscopy, regardless of radiographic findings. (See <a class="local">'Inhaled retained airway foreign body'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6382.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Tic cough</strong> – Tic cough (also known as habit cough) describes a cough with repetitive and habitual features similar to a vocal tic. Key characteristics are suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and presence of a premonitory sensation.
