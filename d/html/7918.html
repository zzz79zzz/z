This topic covers the logistics of platelet use and the indications for platelet transfusion in adults. The approach to the bleeding patient, refractoriness to platelet transfusion, and platelet transfusion in neonates are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation of bleeding – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Refractoriness to platelet transfusion – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7922.html" rel="external">"Refractoriness to platelet transfusion"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neonates – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97752.html" rel="external">"Neonatal thrombocytopenia: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management", section on 'Platelet transfusion'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H558382031"><span class="h1">COLLECTION METHODS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two ways that platelets can be collected: by isolating and pooling platelets from units of donated whole blood or by collecting platelets via apheresis directly from a donor. Most platelets in the United States are collected by apheresis. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Apheresis (single donor) platelets</strong> – Platelets can also be collected from volunteer donors in a one- to two-hour apheresis procedure. Platelets are selectively removed along with some white blood cells (WBCs) and plasma, and most red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma are returned to the donor. Some systems will also remove the majority of WBCs, resulting in a leukodepleted product. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A typical apheresis platelet unit provides the equivalent of four to six units of platelets from whole blood (3 to 4 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is common in larger donors with high platelet counts for an apheresis procedure to collect enough platelets to split the collected platelets into two separate transfusable apheresis units ("doubles," or "splits"), and sometimes three separate units ("triples") can be obtained from a single donor, increasing the operational efficiency of the collection facility and the availably platelet supply. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Advantages of apheresis platelets are exposure of the recipient to a single donor rather than multiple donors, and the ability to match donor and recipient characteristics such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, cytomegalovirus (CMV) status, and blood type. (See <a class="local">'Ordering platelets'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The effects of platelet apheresis on the donor are covered elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7949.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Overview of recipient and donor protections", section on 'Complications of apheresis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Whole blood derived (WBD) pooled platelets</strong> – A single unit of platelets can be isolated from a whole blood donation by centrifuging the blood within the closed collection system to separate the platelets from the red blood cells (RBCs). Two manufacturing methods are used. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The platelet rich plasma (PRP) method is the main method in use in the United States. It involves the centrifugation of the whole blood first under a sufficient g-force to pellet the RBCs (the "soft spin") but leaves most of the platelets in suspension in the PRP. The PRP is then centrifuged again in a second container at a higher g-force to pellet the platelets (the "hard spin"). The supernatant platelet-poor plasma is removed. The platelets are then resuspended in the residual plasma and stored. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The buffy coat method is used more commonly outside the United States. In this method, whole blood is first subjected to a hard spin to allow plasma to be expressed off the top and the sedimented RBCs to be expressed off the bottom, leaving behind the platelet-containing buffy coat. Several buffy coat units can then be pooled together with plasma or platelet additive solution, and the pool is subjected to a soft spin to sediment the residual RBCs. The pooled platelet concentrate is then expressed off the RBCs and stored.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The number of platelets per unit varies according to the platelet count of the donor and the manufacturing process. However, the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) requires each platelet concentrate unit to contain ≥5.5 x 10<sup>10</sup> platelets/unit in 90 percent of units tested [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The Council of Europe requires each single unit equivalent to contain &gt;6.0 x<sup> </sup>10<sup>10</sup> platelets; a yield of 7 x 10<sup>10</sup> platelets is typical [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Since this number is inadequate to raise the platelet count in an adult recipient, four to six platelet units are pooled to allow transfusion of 3 to 4 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets per transfusion [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These units, produced by either the PRP or the buffy coat method, are called whole blood-derived (WBD) platelets or platelet concentrates; they were previously called random donor pooled platelets.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Advantages of WBD platelets include lower cost and ease of collection and processing (a separate donation procedure and apheresis equipment are not required). The major disadvantage of WBD platelets is recipient exposure to multiple donors in a single transfusion and the increased work of bacterial testing. In addition, it is more labor intensive and time consuming to perform the required bacterial testing. In the United States, commercial collection systems exist that allow the pooling, leukofiltration, and bacterial culture testing to be done by the blood collection agency in an integrated bag system, making prepared pools of platelets "transfusion ready" and easing the burden for the transfusion service.</p><p></p><p>Both WBD and apheresis platelets contain some WBCs that were collected along with the platelets. These WBCs can cause febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), alloimmunization, transmission of CMV, or transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) in some patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7928.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease"</a>.)</p><p>Platelet products are suspended either in plasma or in platelet additive solution, which reduces the plasma volume by approximately one-third. Because of their plasma content, transfused platelets can cause adverse reactions including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and anaphylaxis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7926.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)"</a>.)</p><p>Several strategies are used to prevent the complications associated with the presence of WBCs and plasma in platelet products. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Ordering platelets'</a> below.)</p><p>Platelets concentrates also contain a small number of RBCs that express Rh antigens on their surface (platelets do not express Rh antigens). The small numbers of RBCs in apheresis platelets pose an extremely low, but non-zero risk of Rh alloimmunization in most patients [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, transfusion medicine services generally avoid giving platelets from RhD-positive donors to RhD-negative females of childbearing potential because of the potential risk of RhD alloimmunization and subsequent hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6820.html" rel="external">"RhD alloimmunization in pregnancy: Overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H382870457"><span class="h1">STORAGE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H213552400"><span class="h2">Room temperature storage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Platelets are routinely stored at room temperature because cold induces clustering of von Willebrand factor (WVF) receptors on the platelet surface and morphological changes of the platelets, leading to enhanced clearance by hepatic macrophages and reduced platelet survival in the recipient [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. </p><p>All cells are more metabolically active at room temperature; platelets are stored in bags that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide gas exchange. Citrate is included to prevent clotting and maintain proper pH, and dextrose is added as an energy source [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The risk of bacterial infection from platelets increases with storage duration. The shelf-life of platelets stored at room temperature is generally only five days, which are counted starting from midnight on the day of collection. This short shelf-life contributes to the potential for low platelet inventory and platelet shortages. However, facilities can store platelets for up to seven days if they use a container cleared or approved for seven-day storage by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <strong>and</strong><em> </em>if the platelet unit(s) are subsequently tested for bacteria using a bacterial detection device cleared by the FDA and labeled for use as a "safety measure." </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2548717138"><span class="h2">Cold storage (investigational)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Storage of platelets in the cold (refrigerator temperature; 2° to 6°C) is investigational.</p><p>Cold-stored platelets could potentially reduce the risk of bacterial growth. However, there are concerns about poorer recovery and reduced circulatory half-life of cold-stored platelets [<a href="#rid6">6,10,11</a>]. </p><p>Small preliminary studies suggest that platelets stored in the cold have similar efficacy and safety as platelets stored at room temperature [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. Data also suggest that cold-stored platelets may have superior hemostatic efficacy in patients with acute hemorrhage [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. As such, the use of cold-stored platelets has expanded in military and trauma settings. However, the overall availability of cold-stored platelets is limited and typically reserved for patients with acute trauma [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4037215594"><span class="h2">Cryopreservation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cryopreserved platelets have the potential to dramatically increase shelf-life (to years rather than days) and in turn to greatly improve inventory and availability as well as to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. Cryopreserved platelets are not clinically available in the United States, but they have been used in military settings and are in use or development in some countries in Europe, Asia, and Australia [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>The largest trial of cryopreserved platelets (the cryopreserved versus liquid platelet [CLIP-I] trial) randomly assigned 121 adults undergoing cardiac surgery to receive up to three units of cryopreserved or room temperature-stored (liquid) platelets if they needed a platelet transfusion [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The cryopreserved platelets were prepared from apheresis units from group O donors and frozen in DMSO as a preservative; after thawing they were reconstituted with AB or group-specific plasma. The control platelets (referred to as liquid storage) could be prepared from whole blood derived units or by apheresis (see <a class="local">'Collection methods'</a> above). All measures of blood loss, need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and frequency of adverse events were similar between groups, and there were no thrombotic events associated with cryopreserved platelets. Compared with the control group, the group assigned to cryopreserved platelets had a lower platelet count increment (median platelet count on the first postoperative day, 150,000 in controls versus 112,000/microL for cryopreserved platelets); the cryopreserved platelet group also received more platelet transfusions. </p><p>A reduced platelet count increment with cryopreserved platelets versus controls was also seen in a trial in a small number of hematology-oncology patients who were transfused with platelets in the setting of bleeding and thrombocytopenia [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p>These results suggest that cryopreserved platelets are likely to be safe and effective in a surgical setting. Cryopreserved platelets could potentially be a useful way to augment blood inventories and improve product availability in settings such as combat, in remote locations, or to alleviate shortages in urban areas with high usage. However, additional trials are needed in other patient populations with other clinical indications. Considerable regulatory hurdles must also be addressed [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Another potential concern with cryopreserved platelets is the delay in obtaining the platelet unit due to thawing and reconstitution with plasma [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. This delay is approximately 10 minutes if thawed plasma is available for reconstitution and 30 to 40 minutes if plasma is frozen and also has to be thawed [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3773797681"><span class="h1">STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING BACTERIA AND OTHER PATHOGENS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A disadvantage of room temperature storage (see <a class="local">'Storage'</a> above) is the increased growth of bacteria compared with blood products stored in the refrigerator or freezer.

The guidance provides recommendations to control the risk of bacterial contamination using bacterial testing strategies (culture-based and rapid detection) and pathogen reduction technologies. Culture-based testing includes primary and secondary cultures and large volume delayed sampling (LVDS). Pathogen inactivation of platelets allows for 5 or 7 day storage [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]; details are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7929.html" rel="external">"Pathogen inactivation of blood products", section on 'Platelets'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H558384432"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR PLATELET TRANSFUSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>By convention, most authors use the term "therapeutic transfusion" to refer both to transfusion of platelets to treat active bleeding and transfusion of platelets in preparation for an invasive procedure that could cause bleeding.

The incidence of TACO is in the range of 1 percent of transfused recipients. The incidence is higher in patients predisposed to volume overload due to comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, kidney failure, respiratory failure, and positive fluid balance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7919.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Allergic and anaphylactic reactions</strong> – Allergic reactions to platelet transfusion are relatively common. They are usually due to IgE directed against proteins in the donor plasma. Common symptoms include urticaria and pruritus in mild cases, and wheezing, shortness of breath and hypotension in more severe cases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Allergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with a history of allergic transfusion reactions who require additional platelet transfusions may benefit from platelets in additive solution (PAS), which contain less plasma than non-PAS platelets. Those who continue to have allergic reactions with PAS platelets may receive concentrated or washed platelets. (See <a class="local">'Platelet additive solutions'</a> above and <a class="local">'Other special modifications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Anaphylactic reactions (ie, severe allergic reactions) are a very rare complication of platelet transfusion. These are associated with rapid onset of shock, angioedema, and respiratory distress. Some cases are due to the production of anti-IgA antibodies in recipients who are IgA deficient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR)</strong> – These reactions are mediated by various inflammatory mediators and leukocytes and may manifest as fevers, chills, and rigors.

Its incidence continues to drop due to irradiation of blood products for at-risk patients, such as patients with hematopoietic cell transplantation, immunodeficiency, or other types of immunosuppression. (See <a class="local">'Irradiation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A second and potentially less obvious situation that can lead to TA-GVHD in immunocompetent recipients is partial HLA matching, as can occur in donations made by relatives and in genetically homogeneous populations [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. In this case, the HLA antigens on the donor lymphocytes are seen by the recipient lymphocytes as self, so recipient lymphocytes do not attack the donor lymphocytes; however, recipient cells also express unique HLA antigens that the donor lymphocytes recognize as foreign. This can result in donor lymphocytes destroying the recipient's tissues, including bone marrow, skin and liver, which can be fatal.

This can occur in the &lt;2 percent of individuals who lack the platelet antigen PIA1, now known as human platelet antigen 1a (HPA-1a), and who have become previously sensitized to the antigen during pregnancy or prior transfusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Post-transfusion purpura'</a>.)</p><p>In PTP, transfused platelets are removed by an antibody-mediated mechanism; the patient's own HPA-1a-negative platelets are also destroyed by an incompletely understood process. </p><p>Treatment is with intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), with or without a glucocorticoid.

A general rule of thumb is that transfusion of a standard pool of whole blood derived (WBD) platelets or one apheresis unit should increase the platelet count by approximately 30,000/microL in an adult of average size.</p><p>Platelet count increment is typically measured within 24 hours in patients given prophylactic platelet transfusions. For patients undergoing invasive procedures, it is prudent to check that the desired platelet count was achieved before performing the procedure, which can be done within 10 minutes of the transfusion. For actively bleeding patients, cessation of bleeding is a more important clinical endpoint than the post-transfusion platelet count.</p><p>The length of time platelets have been stored has a modest effect on their survival in the recipient. As an example, compared with platelets stored for two or three days, platelets stored for five days produce a smaller increment in platelet count. This information is not usually factored into assessment of a patient's response to platelet transfusion.</p><p>Many patients who receive platelet transfusions reproducibly show a less-than-expected increase in platelet count.

Apheresis platelets are collected from a single donor and contain approximately 3 to 4 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets (the equivalent of a pool of four to six WBD units). (See <a class="local">'Collection methods'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Storage</strong> – Platelets are stored at room temperature; consequently, their shelf-life is only five days (though it may be extended to seven days if additional requirements are met). Cold storage of platelets and cryopreservation are under study. (See <a class="local">'Storage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bleeding</strong> – Platelet transfusion can be lifesaving in bleeding patients with thrombocytopenia or reduced platelet function. Platelets should be transfused in any patient who is bleeding with a platelet count &lt;50,000/microL (100,000/microL for central nervous system or ocular bleeding), or in any patient with an acquired or inherited platelet function disorder, regardless of platelet count. Platelet transfusion may also be indicated in thrombocytopenic patients undergoing invasive procedures, depending on the procedure and the platelet count. (See <a class="local">'Actively bleeding patient'</a> above and <a class="local">'Preparation for an invasive procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Other conditions that impair hemostasis (coagulopathy, fever, infection, anatomic lesions) should be corrected in thrombocytopenic patients when possible, to reduce active bleeding and lessen the risk of spontaneous bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Actively bleeding patient'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Prophylaxis</strong> – For most hospitalized afebrile patients with platelet counts ≤10,000/microL due to bone marrow suppression, we suggest prophylactic platelet transfusion rather than reserving transfusions only for bleeding (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Centers that use lower thresholds or only transfuse for bleeding should ensure that experienced clinicians are present who can rapidly identify bleeding and administer platelet transfusions. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Some individuals may require transfusion at higher platelet counts. For patients with fever, infection, or inflammation, we generally transfuse at a platelet count ≤15,000 to 20,000/microL due to the increased risk of bleeding. For patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is associated with a severe coagulopathy, we transfuse at a platelet count of ≤30,000 to 50,000/microL. (See <a class="local">'Prevention of spontaneous bleeding'</a> above and <a class="local">'Specific clinical scenarios'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Platelet consumption disorders</strong> – Patients with platelet consumption disorders, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, as well as those with platelet function disorders, are typically transfused only for bleeding or selected invasive procedures. Platelets should <strong>not</strong> be withheld in bleeding patients with these conditions due to fear of "fueling the fire" of thrombosis. (See <a class="local">'Specific clinical scenarios'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Platelet transfusion has risks, including sepsis/infection, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), alloimmunization, allergic and anaphylactic transfusion reactions, febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD), and post-transfusion purpura (PTP).
