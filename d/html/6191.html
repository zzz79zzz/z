It is characterized by deficits in both intellectual and adaptive functioning of varying severity presenting before 18 years of age [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. ID encompasses a broad spectrum of functioning, disability, and strengths. ID is an important public health issue because of its prevalence, its impact on affected individuals, and the need for extensive support services. ID affects approximately 1 percent of the population. Its management requires early diagnosis and intervention, including access to health care and appropriate supports.</p><p>The management, outcomes, and prevention of ID in children are discussed here. Other aspects of ID are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6172.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability (ID) in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2779.html" rel="external">"Primary care of the adult with intellectual and developmental disabilities"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H723956459"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following terms are used throughout this topic and are described in greater detail in a separate topic review (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6172.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability (ID) in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Global developmental delay (GDD)</strong> – GDD is the preferred term to describe intellectual and adaptive impairment in infants and young children &lt;5 years old who fail to meet expected developmental milestones in multiple areas of functioning. GDD may be used as a provisional diagnosis until comprehensive standardized testing can be accurately and reliably completed. Not all children with GDD meet criteria for ID as they grow older.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intellectual disability (ID)</strong> – ID is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood and is characterized by limitations in both intelligence and adaptive skills, affecting at least one of three adaptive domains (conceptual, social, and practical), with varying severity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90174 graphicRef95384" href="/z/d/graphic/90174.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a>). The extent of adaptive impairment is key to defining ID and its severity.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4205731809"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The overall goals of the management of ID are to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lessen the effects of disability</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prevent, halt, or limit deterioration in the child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Strengthen, improve, and optimize functioning in the child's everyday circumstances (eg, home, school, community, and vocational settings)</p><p></p><p>To accomplish these goals, multiple supports are generally necessary. Interventions should be evidence-based, begin early, and be sustained; they should be initiated regardless of whether an underlying cause of ID has been identified. Goals should be individualized, appropriate, and achievable. Individualized supports should improve the functioning and lessen the disability of the person with ID.</p><p>The approach should be collaborative and multidisciplinary. Optimal use of available resources, coordinated continuity in care, monitoring of progress, and matching interventions to the unique and changing needs of individuals over time are key components. Interventions may need to be prioritized for efficacy and benefits to an individual in their everyday settings and changed according to differing lifetime needs. For example, an emphasis should be placed on vocational goals during adolescence and vocational professionals should be part of the multidisciplinary team. Ethical principles and legal considerations are also important in guiding management.</p><p>There is no universally accepted standardized protocol or practice guideline for the comprehensive management of children and adolescents with ID.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1934859009"><span class="h2">General considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>General considerations in caring for children with ID differ somewhat from caring for typically developing children. They include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effective communication strategies</strong> – Effective communication strategies are essential when interacting with children with ID. This is relevant across all ages and settings. Communication should be clear, concise, concrete (rather than abstract), and at the level of the child's language understanding. Unnecessary details or superfluous words should be omitted; children with verbal deficits (eg, Down syndrome) often have difficulty filtering out what is irrelevant [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Where verbal functions are limited, communication can be enhanced by hands-on demonstration, use of visual adjuncts, or visual-spatial learning. Information should be simply, meaningfully, and respectfully shared at the functional level of the child or adolescent, especially in matters that require consent. Preschool levels of functioning are compatible with surrogate consent; primary school level of functioning enables partial participation and assent but not full consent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Encouraging independent functioning</strong> – Strategies to gradually increase personal responsibility and independent functioning are needed [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Greater independent functioning eventually results in better vocational, employment, and placement results; advocacy, caregiver resourcefulness, and governing policies and systems can improve independent functioning in children with ID [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Involved decision-making should be increased according to individual capability and desire to do so [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Support for family members</strong> – It is important for health care providers to provide support and counseling to families of children with ID. Support services for affected family members can help address psychosocial stress, depression, helplessness, anxiety, and need for respite. Levels of psychosocial stress and optimism vary among families who have a child with ID or global developmental delay (GDD). Families of severely impaired children with multiple special needs frequently have the greatest need for psychosocial support; families of children with Down syndrome report less stress and more optimism [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It may be helpful to connect families with supportive parent groups and other resources in their community; often, this is accomplished with the help of a social worker. Examples of organizations that can help inform, support, and advocate for individuals with ID include <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thearc.org%2F&amp;token=T4slFgMKaJb%2B0Y4X17Zdcqkdf9JVrPQMyVgAr7XlZ4c%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6191" target="_blank">The Arc</a>, Family-to-Family Health Information Centers, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autism-society.org%2F&amp;token=0e64WmB8Y%2B9YkspAK0sxMK1BeZkLoCkLMdGKhCuKOZ9n7KTWZlQiQEjERt5SQjqK&amp;TOPIC_ID=6191" target="_blank">Autism Society of America</a>, and support groups corresponding to specific genetic syndromes or conditions (eg, fragile X, Down syndrome). Such organizations and other forms of community participation can help support positive social relationships for a child with ID and his or her family. Positive, warmly nurturing, patiently encouraging parenting styles are more helpful to support child resilience than negative parenting; urging achievable independence and task completion is advised.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advocating on behalf of the child</strong> – Parents and providers are frequently effective in advocating for a child with ID, such as motivating for necessary services to advance functioning. For providers, this is an ethical responsibility of taking care of vulnerable children with special needs. By definition, ID requires ongoing support [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]; children with ID are able to make progress, provided that they receive appropriate supports. Advocacy (eg, by parents) and caregiver resourcefulness are factors that improve independent outcomes in children with ID [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Multidisciplinary collaboration</strong> – In the United States, the approach to caring for children with ID typically involves multiple providers collaboratively contributing to the assessment of ongoing needs and recommendations for targeted interventions and support in their area of expertise. The medical home and the pivotal role of parents or family are important and nevertheless emphasized.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1598834652"><span class="h2">Preventative screening and routine care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>General preventative screening and routine health care maintenance interventions should be no less than those of typically developing children. There are no anticipatory guidance protocols that comprehensively cover the needs of all children and adolescents with ID; anticipatory guidance should address age-specific as well as functional level-specific preventative health risks and needs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2872.html" rel="external">"Screening tests in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108.html" rel="external">"Guidelines for adolescent preventive services"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1501542643"><span class="h2">Longitudinal developmental surveillance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Effective longitudinal developmental surveillance in ID expands upon standard pediatric surveillance and the initial assessment performed to establish the diagnosis of ID. Various providers can contribute to this, including developmental pediatricians, neurodevelopmental neurologists, and/or clinical psychologists.</p><p>Longitudinal surveillance is coupled with direct interventions over the course of a child's life to advance and strengthen functional progress. ID-specific concerns of the parent, provider, and individual are taken into consideration. The individual's functional profile (relative strengths, impairments, challenges), developmental trajectory (progress, plateau, stagnation, skill loss), and ongoing management plan can be sensitively discussed with the family and appropriate targeted supports put in place. The management plan requires collaborative agreement and application.</p><p>Goals may need adjusting to optimally strengthen and advance functioning. The child's environment may need to be modified. Interventional strategies should be flexible and responsive towards the needs of the individual and their family [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Serial standardized testing assessments generate a curve of the individual's progress over time, which helps guide interventions. For example, nonverbal and visual learning strengths may be paired with interventions aimed at improving language weakness. Identification of difficulties with certain motor skills (eg, eye-hand coordination, fine or gross motor skills) may prompt additional specific supports to address these issues.</p><p>If there are multiple conditions contributing to impairments in a child with ID, comprehensive testing can better inform interventional strategies. If deficits involve only a single domain, a narrower focus is usually appropriate.</p><p>The tool(s) used for testing should include lower-level skills with reasonable accuracy. The choice of a specific tool is individualized based on the child's age, language, functional level, disability profile, and affected domains. Specific tools are summarized in the table and discussed in greater detail in separate topics  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118432" href="/z/d/graphic/118432.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6172.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability (ID) in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment of adaptive function'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/615.html" rel="external">"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care"</a>.)</p><p>The progress of children with ID is often compared with typical normative curves of children without a disability, but progress may also be compared with cause-specific normative developmental milestones or outcome curves for individuals with ID as they become available (eg, in a studied population of individuals with Down syndrome) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2890680888"><span class="h2">Early interventions for intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early application of evidence-based interventions optimizes functioning and progress of infants and children with ID. Most individuals with ID require a broad range of interventions specific to their needs and functional deficits. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Speech and language therapy – Most individuals with ID have some level of language-based impairment, which can impact their conceptual adaptive functioning and other daily living functions and activities. Speech and language therapy can advance a child's language, speech, articulation, and communication functioning, and it advances other skill gains. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/619.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and treatment of speech and language disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occupational therapy – Occupational therapy can advance functional gains in eye-hand coordination and other motor skills.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical therapy – Physical therapy can improve mobility and other motor skill functions and provide postural support and other adjuncts for affected individuals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hearing and vision services – Services for hearing and vision are important to optimize functioning and improve everyday participation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6261.html" rel="external">"Vision screening and assessment in infants and children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6298.html" rel="external">"Hearing loss in children: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early education assessment and services – In the United States and many other countries, early education services are widely applied to advance educationally pertinent development, behavior, and learning. (See <a class="local">'Early intervention'</a> below and <a class="local">'Special education'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional living skills – Functional living skills should be included from a young age. Help with problem-solving and planning are usually necessary. In the classroom, strategies may include preferential seating (eg, seating the child close to the teacher), providing additional time, redirecting to stay on task, minimizing distraction, using interests and strengths to advance weaker functions, reducing complex tasks into discrete sequential steps, using observational and multisensory learning approaches (eg, visual presentation and hands-on demonstration), applying checks for understanding, and reinforcing and generalizing learning. Children and adolescents with ID are less likely to ask for help or let others know when they do not understand [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family-centered interventions – Specialists involved in managing children with ID can advise interventions for caregivers and family to practice with the child at home. These have long been used to informally extend intervention to the home setting and are known to improve child and family psychosocial well-being. Family-centered interventions also provide continuity of care should educational and other services be interrupted (as occurred in the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic). Ideally, children with ID should have an updatable, evidence-based home intervention plan targeted to their needs, with input from the respective professionals in the care team [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Social support – Interventions that focus on improving social participation are important for children with ID. This can improve independent functioning and enhance quality of life. Compared with typically developing peers, young children with ID tend to have less frequent play with other children, fewer friends, poorer-quality friendships, and reduced levels of social participation [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Social supports may be provided in educational and other settings [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Community integration interventions can improve friendship development and inclusion in recreation with typical peers. Participation can be enhanced by selecting activities appropriate to the ability and interest of the child and including individualized mentoring along with peer interactions [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Behavioral interventions – Behavioral interventions may be aimed at addressing difficult behaviors or specific comorbid conditions (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, depression, sleep problems) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Behavioral interventions can improve behavior-related functioning, performance, and participation in everyday activities and during other service interventions. Interventions that lack a sufficient evidence base are advised against (eg, sensory treatments) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Behavior intervention'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consultation with a dietician – Consultation with a dietician may be necessary in some cases to address malnutrition-specific dietary needs (eg, in metabolic or endocrine disorders) or to evaluate the child's nutritional status and ensure a well-balanced diet. Evidence is lacking to support alternative dietary treatments or supplements. In particular, high doses of fat-soluble vitamins should be avoided because excessive doses can have toxic effects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2877.html" rel="external">"Poor weight gain in children older than two years in resource-abundant settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2866.html" rel="external">"Dietary recommendations for toddlers and preschool and school-age children", section on 'Dietary composition'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Treatment of specific causes of intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most causes of ID do not have a specific treatment or intervention. However, if a treatable underlying cause of ID is identified (eg, congenital hypothyroidism, treatable inborn error of metabolism), the child should be promptly treated to prevent further disability.

Behavioral interventions should be individualized, with a goal of encouraging appropriate sleep hygiene, providing a supportive routine, and avoiding inadvertent reinforcement of undesirable behaviors. Interventions need consistent application. Sleep problems in children with ID tend to improve gradually with appropriate intervention, and they may escalate before improving.

Sleep disorders can be more complex in the setting of an underlying genetic syndrome causing ID. For example, children with Down or Prader-Willi syndromes are at risk for obstructive sleep apnea and those with Smith-Magenis syndrome may have insomnia. Children with these conditions generally require formal evaluation by a sleep specialist with polysomnography.

A school psychologist can assist with behavioral difficulties in the child's educational setting. Applied behavioral analysis can improve staying on task and help extinguish unwanted misbehaviors that challenge participation in various settings [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Group psychotherapy may be helpful for children at school ages with sufficient communication and intellectual functioning to meaningfully participate (a minimum of six to seven years of age-equivalent intellectual functioning is usually necessary). In general, a group intervention should be part of a comprehensive treatment program and involve a trained therapist. Techniques need to be adapted to the child's level of functioning. Group therapy is most applicable to adolescents and is particularly useful in social skills training.</p><p>Children with higher levels of self-esteem and independence tend to have fewer problem behaviors. Transition interventions for youth should include problem-solving, planning, issues of sexuality, knowledge of rights, issues of transition into adult life, and preparation for independent community living.

For children with ID, transition planning should begin at or by age <strong>12 years</strong> [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. In the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates that affected students have a transition plan by 16 years of age; however, earlier transition and vocational planning is encouraged well before this age.</p><p>Early individualized discussions and interventions gradually prepare the child and family. These may address issues of vocation, independent living/functioning, independent decision-making or guardianship, care coordination, sexuality, reproduction, life expectancy, health insurance, eligibility for adult community-based<sup> </sup>services, medical management by different specialists, advance directives, and communication preferences of the child or youth with ID. The child or youth with ID should be involved as much as possible in the development of the plan and the decision-making process; his or her level of understanding should be assessed and documented. Student advocacy and self-determination should be encouraged. The family should also be included. Youth with ID and autism have greater identified needs for support after school and are less likely to take an active leadership role compared with those without autism [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>A transition plan should be documented by age 14 years and reviewed annually thereafter [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. A transition plan focuses on interventions needed to attain transition readiness and accomplish successful transition. It may include assessment of transition readiness, setting realistic goals, and planning anticipated timelines. It is used to implement and monitor the transition process until 18 years of age, or the time of actual transition, which may be later.</p><p>Transition services may help individuals adjust from school to adult settings with occupational and other activities and prepare young people with ID for anticipated changes. Interventions may help individuals to advocate for themselves. Supports may include a job coach, assistance with transport, legal advocacy, supported employment, social security disability benefits and income, or assisted living.</p><p>Transition-related resources for professionals include educational guide books, evaluation tools, and checklists.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Intellectual deficits may be distinctively worse in some causes of ID than in other causes of ID. For example, individuals with Down syndrome have disproportionate deficits in executive functioning, verbal working memory, and reaction times that exceed those of other individuals with ID [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Such deficits may persist and can become more obvious over time, especially with increased demands. However, outcomes can vary considerably even within the same etiology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most causes of ID do not result in progressive deterioration in function, though some genetic and metabolic causes are expected to cause progressive worsening in function. In other cases, cognitive deterioration can occur from another cause (eg, when a patient with ID has an accidental brain injury or develops Alzheimer disease).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Newborn screening has been pivotal to improving outcomes in individuals with certain treatable causes of ID (eg, inborn errors of metabolism) or concurrent impairing condition (eg, endocrine abnormality). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4980.html" rel="external">"Overview of newborn screening"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comorbid conditions</strong> – Other comorbid conditions (eg, other developmental disabilities, mental health problems, vision or hearing impairment, motor deficits, seizure disorder) may impair progress, transition, and functional outcomes in individuals with ID. For example, in a child with ID and cerebral palsy, gross motor impairment primarily determines mobility outcomes, while cognitive impairment is important in determining the performance of daily living activities [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Persistent impairment due to autism impacts transition and post-transition outcomes. Behavioral difficulties, substance abuse, obesity, depression, suicidal ideation and attempt, limited understanding of risk and accidents, neglect, and abuse or harm perpetrated by others may also impact the course and functioning of an individual with ID.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Environmental and social factors</strong> – Multiple environmental factors affect the natural history and outcome of ID. Family, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors may impact the child's course. Social opportunities are important, and caregiver support, expectations, attitudes, and motivation can have an effect. Children with ID are more likely to be affected by poverty compared with typically developing children [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Access to services</strong> – The availability and provision of individualized supports (eg, early intervention and educational, vocational, transition, and post-transition services) have a considerable impact on outcomes for individuals with ID [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Deinstitutionalization has improved the lives of many individuals with ID; however, specialized support needs have shifted into community settings, which requires planning, financial provision, and comprehensive services. Appropriate supports lessen the impact of disability and improve the functioning of individuals with ID. For many children, developmental progress is manifested by stable, enduring gains in function, but, for others, the improvements are contingent upon sustaining support [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For youth with ID, factors that impact the success of transitioning into adulthood include access, availability, and provision of needed interventions; quality and extent of transition and post-school services; necessary expertise in care; residential options; occupational opportunities; transport; and socioeconomic and family factors [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Transition of individuals with ID is important to subsequent progress and long-term functioning. (See <a class="local">'Transition planning'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H110680760"><span class="h2">Outcomes according to severity level</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The level of severity in ID markedly influences short- and long-term outcomes. Severity is defined by the level of support needed rather than by IQ scores  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384" href="/z/d/graphic/95384.html" rel="external">table 1B</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6172.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability (ID) in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Severity classification'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Mild intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most affected children and adolescents have mild ID. Children with mild ID attain higher levels of skills and progress at a faster pace than children with more severe ID. Children with mild ID can be anticipated to gain skills at approximately one-half to two-thirds of the rate of children without ID. Outcomes vary depending on coexisting conditions and level of support provided. Standardized test scores achieved by children with mild ID tend to decrease over time, compared with typically developing children. However, some children with mild levels of global developmental delay (GDD) who receive appropriate early intervention may make sufficient progress by five years of age such that they may not meet criteria for ID. In addition, some children with ID can improve in their adaptive functioning with appropriate individualized intervention and no longer meet adaptive impairment criteria required for an ID diagnosis.</p><p>Most children with mild ID need sustained academic supports to be able to learn and acquire age-typical conceptual skills, such as reading [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. With appropriate supportive services, children with mild ID usually accomplish reading at a 3<sup>rd</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade level by late adolescence [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. However, some adults with mild ID are functionally illiterate. Individuals with mild ID have difficulties grasping complex information. Planning, problem-solving, and money management need long-term support. Greater gullibility, less mature judgment, and vulnerability to manipulation put children and adolescents with mild ID at particular risk.</p><p>Children with mild ID have better social skills, communication, and social judgment than children with more severe ID, and they usually can relate to others, communicate in friendship, and display social play and extracurricular interests. However, their interests and skill levels may be similar to those of younger children. Social adaptive and communication outcomes vary depending on other coexisting conditions. Children with autism have disproportionate impairment in social skills communication for their level of cognitive functioning.</p><p>The long-term outcome of individuals with mild ID is related to their combined cognitive and adaptive functioning. Most individuals with mild ID are able to accomplish independent daily living activities. Many are able to live independently with provided supports, including decision-making for health, nutrition, finances, or raising a family. Adults with mild ID can marry and become parents, although raising children is challenging.</p><p>Individuals with mild ID have the greatest potential for vocational placement, provided that they receive appropriate individualized services and that other comorbidities aren't prohibitive. Some affected adults can attain a simple regular position requiring straightforward occupational skills or paid employment in a competitive workplace, given appropriate supports. However, adults with low levels of functional independence need sheltered employment and assisted living or a group home. In one report of long-term follow-up of 52 individuals with mild ID followed from birth to adulthood, 73 percent were married, 67 percent had a job, 62 percent had children, and 54 percent owned their own home [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Moderate intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 10 percent of individuals with ID have moderate ID. Children with moderate ID are able to slowly make progress in skill development and usually develop at approximately one-third to one-half of the rate of children without ID [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p>School-based academic and social development gains are slow. Conceptual skills lag well behind those of peers; substantial help or support is needed for conceptual tasks. Academic skills in adults are typically at elementary level. Children with moderate ID learn to read essential words and signs such as "stop," "exit," or "danger." With educational services, a child with moderate ID can eventually learn to read at a 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> grade level.</p><p>Simple spoken language and social friendships are possible but significantly limited by social and communication deficits. Social cues, social judgment, and social decisions need regular help and support.</p><p>Long-term outcomes of moderate ID vary markedly, dependent on the presence and extent of coexisting conditions and disorders that frequently complicate moderate ID. Most individuals with moderate ID are capable of learning daily living activities and can achieve independent self-care, with sufficient teaching and support. Complex daily living tasks (eg, money management) need considerable support. Most individuals are able to reside in a group home in a community setting with support. The majority of adults with moderate ID need sheltered, supported, noncompetitive, vocational positions with minimal communication and conceptual demands, although some are capable of performing unskilled work. Few with moderate ID are able to marry or raise children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Severe intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Only 3 to 4 percent of individuals with ID are severely affected. Children with severe ID gain skills at a rate of approximately one-quarter to one-third of that expected for children without ID and approximately one-half of the pace of children with mild ID.</p><p>Individuals with severe ID have little understanding of written language or number, time, or money concepts; caretakers provide extensive help in problem-solving.</p><p>Individuals with severe ID derive benefit from healthy, socially supportive interactions with familiar people who relate at the level of the individual's development. Speech development may be delayed until four to five years of age, although some do not develop speech; individuals may use a basic single word or phrase or gesture to communicate direct experience.</p><p>Most individuals with severe ID require training in social and self-help daily living skills in high school and may be trainable in some basic daily living activities, while requiring significant ongoing support and supervision. Adults without prohibitive coexisting conditions may be able to participate in sheltered vocational settings and, if not behaviorally disruptive, reside in a group home in the community with appropriate supports. The majority of adults with severe ID need substantial assistance with daily living and social skills. In general, severely affected individuals do not marry or raise children [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Severe ID is associated with a reduced lifespan.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h3">Profound intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 1 to 2 percent of children with ID have profound impairment. Individuals with profound ID may express themselves nonverbally and understand a simple instruction, gesture, or emotional cue. However, outcomes are highly variable and can vary from total dependence to some simple expression and social responsiveness; some individuals learn simple self-care in dressing or feeding.</p><p>Individuals with profound ID are usually dependent in all aspects of daily living and have pervasive need of supports. Some affected individuals benefit from training in self-help skills, though gains are very slow. Individuals may use objects in a goal-directed fashion in self-care or simple recreation. Most need high school classes in life skills and comprehensive assistance. Individuals with profound ID do not learn to read. Concurrent sensory and physical limitations are common, and coexisting medical conditions may need additional equipment. Medical needs, coexisting conditions, and behavioral characteristics impact placement decisions for individuals with profound ID [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p>Profound ID is associated with reduced life expectancy, though the extent depends on the cause, complicating disorders, and the individual's mobility. In one report of 7060 people with profound ID, life expectancy was considerably higher among individuals who were mobile (even if unable to walk) and capable of eating with assistance compared with individuals who were immobile and/or dependent on tube feeding (23 versus 4 to 8 years) [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most causes of ID cannot be prevented. Preventive strategies include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary prevention</strong> – Primary prevention describes measures to prevent ID by addressing the conditions that cause or contribute to ID.

This approach includes all of the interventions described in the preceding sections. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25336217"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goals</strong> – The overall goals of management of intellectual disability (ID) are to lessen the effects of disability and improve functioning; to prevent or minimize further deterioration relative to peers; and to promote optimal functioning in the child's home, school, vocational, and community settings. (See <a class="local">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Importance of early intervention and collaborative approach</strong> – Interventions should begin early and should be individualized and sustained. The approach should be collaborative and multidisciplinary. Depending on the individual's needs, intervention may include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy and rehabilitation, vision and hearing services, family counseling and support, behavioral intervention, interventions to improve social participation, educational assistance, community integration, independent functioning and life skills learning, advocacy, and other aids. Effective communication approaches should be used. (See <a class="local">'General considerations'</a> above and <a class="local">'Early interventions for intellectual disability'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Components of care</strong> – Key aspects of care for children with ID include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Longitudinal developmental surveillance</strong> – This expands upon standard pediatric surveillance and is coupled with direct interventions over the course of a child's life to advance and strengthen functional progress. (See <a class="local">'Longitudinal developmental surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Treatment of underlying causes, if present</strong> – Most causes of ID do not have a specific treatment or intervention. However, if a treatable underlying cause of ID is identified (eg, congenital hypothyroidism, treatable inborn error of metabolism), the child should be promptly treated to prevent further disability. (See <a class="local">'Treatment of specific causes of intellectual disability'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Treatment of comorbidities</strong> – Interventions for other neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders associated with ID include family counseling, education, condition-specific behavioral interventions, and psychopharmacologic therapy. The use of medications should be part of a clear, comprehensive psychosocial treatment plan that includes appropriate behavioral intervention, considers risks and benefits, identifies baseline behavioral functioning, targets behaviors and treatment goals, and provides evidence-based treatment with baseline and serial monitoring. (See <a class="local">'Neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Behavior interventions</strong> – Behavior interventions are usually needed to improve social and behavioral functioning in children with ID and to address behavioral difficulties. These should be individualized and applied consistently. Desirable behaviors should be positively reinforced, and restraining or punitive aversive approaches should be avoided. (See <a class="local">'Behavior intervention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Transition planning</strong> – Transition planning discussion should begin at or by 12 years of age, with a written transition plan in the child's record by 16 years of age. (See <a class="local">'Transition planning'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Legislative mandates</strong> – In the United States, federal legislation supports a range of services for children with ID. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides for early intervention and special education for children with disabilities from birth to 21 years of age. All children with disabilities are mandated to receive a comprehensive education in the least restrictive environment, using an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), with measurable goals that are tailored to the individual's needs and abilities. (See <a class="local">'Legislative mandates'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcomes</strong> – The outcome for ID is variable and depends on multiple factors such as the cause and severity of ID, presence and severity of other associated conditions, environmental and social factors, and access to appropriate individualized services.
