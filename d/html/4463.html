Reasons for errors include human fallibility, medical complexity, system deficiencies, and defensive barriers. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine estimated that medical errors account for up to 98,000 deaths each year in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Although there are more than 4 million hospitalizations related to childbirth in the United States each year, there is a paucity of data specifically addressing medical errors in obstetrics. Nevertheless, medical errors do not spare this population and it is likely that strategies to reduce these errors would benefit pregnant women and their children.</p><p>Strategies to reduce errors and subsequent adverse outcomes have focused on team and individual training; simulations and drills; development of protocols, guidelines and checklists; use of information technology; and education [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These activities and tools apply to inpatient and office settings [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Although most studies describe positive reactions among participants and improvements in knowledge, skills, and behavior, data on patient outcomes after clinician-training programs are limited [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Simulation training, specifically as it relates to shoulder dystocia management and performance of operative vaginal delivery, has shown the most promise for improving clinical outcomes.</p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transmasculine and gender expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TEAMWORK TRAINING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Failures in teamwork and communication account for 70 percent of sentinel events in obstetrics [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Recognizing this, the Joint Commission, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Institute of Medicine all acknowledge that teamwork/communication is a critical element of patient safety [<a href="#rid1">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>In a labor and delivery setting, the patient and her baby are not cared for solely by her obstetric providers, but also by nurses, anesthesia and pediatric providers, and support staff. Formal teamwork training is increasingly becoming a part of the orientation of new hospital staff members, with the goal of improving teamwork and communication [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. There is some evidence (reviewed below) that formal training in these concepts will improve patient safety, team performance, and maternal-fetal outcomes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Training methods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of training methods and evaluation tools has been developed and studied, which makes generalization of results difficult. Two of the better-known methods are:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25498781"><span class="h3">MedTeams training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MedTeams training is an adaptation of a program used for training emergency department personnel and is based on aviation crew resource management principles [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Crew resource management has been defined as a management system that makes optimum use of all available resources: equipment, procedures, and people, to promote safety and enhance the efficiency of flight operations [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The core concepts of this training program are communication, situation monitoring, mutual support, and leadership [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>A criticism of the MedTeams approach is its reliance upon the concept of crew resource management at the exclusion of other aspects of team training science.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25498790"><span class="h3">TeamSTEPPS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A more inclusive teamwork training program that focuses on communication, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ahrq.gov%2Fteamstepps%2Findex.html&amp;token=%2BCjrhIBVW0jZK35njTvgcdRhfF2JZ7qDDWmN6myIF96cs1l2iFkKbtrV%2BfkOxX3lkC1k3ZyiWLBz9LQZTAEWwA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=4463" target="_blank">TeamSTEPPS</a> (Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety), was created to address the criticism of MedTeams and has been implemented at many military hospitals [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Although supporting data on the impact of TeamSTEPPS training are limited, the program appears to be helpful. One study reported a nearly 40 percent reduction in Weighted Adverse Outcome Scores for perinatal morbidity in two hospitals that adopted TeamSTEPPS compared with a control hospital [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Obstetric outcomes of teamwork training studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following studies represent the available evidence illustrating the modest effects of teamwork training on pregnancy outcome:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25498797"><span class="h3">Department of Defense randomized trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Department of Defense evaluated the effect of teamwork training on adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in 15 military and civilian hospitals with a combined total of over 53,000 deliveries annually [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The intervention group consisted of 1307 labor and delivery personnel randomly assigned to MedTeams training; personnel assigned to the no training group served as controls. Outcomes were recorded before, and five months after, the teamwork training intervention.</p><p>The composite maternal and neonatal outcome measure, the Adverse Outcome Index (AOI), was defined as the number of patients with one or more adverse outcomes divided by the total number of deliveries [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Adverse maternal outcomes recorded included maternal death, uterine rupture, unplanned admission to an intensive care unit, unplanned return to the operating room, blood transfusion, and third- or fourth-degree vaginal laceration. Adverse neonatal outcomes recorded included intrapartum death of a fetus weighing at least 500 g at 24 or more weeks of gestation, death within seven days of birth of a baby with birth weight of at least 2500 g, neonatal birth trauma, unplanned admission of a term baby to the intensive care nursery, and five-minute Apgar score of less than 7 in a term baby. Additionally, teamwork was measured using 11 process measures that evaluated length of stay and delays in action where multiple care providers were involved.</p><p>In both the intervention and control groups, outcomes of approximately 4000 deliveries before training were used for baseline comparisons and 10,000 deliveries after training (or no training) were used for the postintervention evaluation. There were no differences in baseline characteristics or outcomes between the groups. Major findings of the trial were:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the individual maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes or in the composite AOI.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Of the 11 process measures evaluated, the only significant difference between groups was that the intervention group had a reduction in the time from decision to proceed with immediate cesarean delivery to the time of incision, which fell from 33 minutes to 21 minutes. The investigators attributed this finding to the formation of contingency teams (obstetric and anesthesia attending physicians, obstetric chief resident, labor nurse and surgical scrub nurse) at the hospitals that received teamwork training and concluded the reduction in decision-to-incision time of 10 minutes may have clinical significance.</p><p></p><p>The lead civilian hospital in the trial discussed above [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] subsequently implemented a modified version of the original MedTeams teamwork training curriculum for all of their labor and delivery staff and then compared the AOI for the three years prior to program implementation with the AOI four years after implementation; the year that the processes were instituted was excluded [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. After universal teamwork training, the AOI decreased from 5.9 to 4.6 percent, which represented 300 fewer women experiencing an adverse event. The number of high-severity malpractice claims fell from 13 to 5 cases. Actual incurred indemnity was not addressed.</p><p>The investigators suggested that the improvement in outcomes in their study (in contrast to the findings of the original multi-center trial) may have been due to the longer length of follow-up, the creation of other protocols not related to teamwork training, and/or better integration of the teamwork training into practice.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25498804"><span class="h3">Observational studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While initial observational data reported improvements in the adverse outcome index (AOI), subsequent studies have reported improvement in patient-specific outcomes.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific outcomes</strong> – In a 2021 observational study that assessed response to postpartum hemorrhage from uterine atony before and after implementation of a multidisciplinary simulation program, patients treated after the simulation training had lower estimated overall blood loss (1200 versus 1500 mL), received blood products earlier in the first 12 hours following delivery (51 versus 102 minutes), and had reduced variation in time from uterotonic to blood administration [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adverse outcomes index</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a 2012 study that evaluated a combination of MedTeams and simulation training on a labor and delivery unit, a reduction in an AOI was observed at 18 months follow-up [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a 2009 study, a large academic hospital instituted a comprehensive safety strategy including creation of standardized protocols, teamwork training, and training in the interpretation of fetal heart rate monitoring [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. They used the AOI to evaluate composite outcome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>After the intervention, the AOI decreased significantly and a provider survey reported significant improvement in the safety climate (ie, the sum of employee perceptions regarding overall safety within the workplace).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>However, there were no significant improvements in the individual outcomes comprising the AOI, other than a decrease in episiotomy rate (which has been falling worldwide anyway). The cesarean delivery rate increased over the study period (as it has worldwide).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A limitation of this study was that there were no means to determine which of the several safety interventions performed may have led to the modest improvement in outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Team performance evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Objectively evaluating team performance is a critical step in determining the effect of any teamwork training program. Given modest evidence that teamwork training improves patient safety, it is gaining in popularity [<a href="#rid6">6,19-21</a>]. Further research is needed to determine whether, and what type of, training actually reduces adverse events [<a href="#rid22">22</a>] and the combination of medical didactic training, teamwork theory, and simulation experience that will be most effective [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p>The following studies have attempted to create a useful means for objective measurement of teamwork in an obstetric setting, but results have been conflicting. Of note, all of the studies used some sort of rating scale, but none evaluated patient outcomes.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2020 systematic review of nine trials, some, but not all, studies found improvement in patient level composite adverse outcomes after training [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. All studies that included teamwork evaluation found improvement after their intervention. Included trials were those that sought to improve teamwork during deliveries using various training methods compared with no specific teamwork interventions. Primary outcome was patient outcome, with teamwork outcomes as secondary. Nine studies were included in the analysis, performed in five countries. Over 3800 health care providers and over 107,000 deliveries were observed. Five of the studies evaluated teamwork in simulated deliveries; the other four evaluated teamwork in the clinical setting. Teamwork training included didactic sessions and/or simulations with varying clinical scenarios, including postpartum hemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, and eclampsia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One study evaluated two tools for rating teamwork in four obstetric emergency scenarios [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The first evaluation tool, the Human Factors Rating Scale (HFRS), adapted the Operating Room Management Attitudes' Questionnaire (ORMAQ) to obstetric scenarios. It consisted of a 45 item survey with questions on the themes of leadership-structure, confidence-assertion, information sharing, teamwork, and error. The second evaluation tool consisted of a single five-point rating scale, the Global Rating Scale (GRS), to judge overall team performance. Descriptions of each level of performance along the five-point scale were provided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These tools were evaluated by having teams complete four obstetric emergency scenarios and then each team member used both evaluation tools (HFRS and GRS) to evaluate the team's performance. Nine external raters used the same evaluation tools to rate the teams. There was good inter-observer reliability among team members and among external raters; however, the correlation between the two groups was poor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The investigators concluded that the HFRS did not adequately differentiate the difficulty of the individual scenarios. The GRS better identified the more difficult scenarios, but was too simple to separate performance in the various domains of team performance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another group created a teamwork evaluation tool using principles of crew resource management [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The tool, called the Clinical Teamwork Scale (CTS), evaluates 15 items in the domains of communication, situational awareness, decision making, role responsibility, and patient friendliness. To validate this tool, three evaluators used the CTS to evaluate teams performing a shoulder dystocia drill, comparing their performance with recordings demonstrating good, average, and excellent teamwork. The investigators concluded that the CTS demonstrated good construct validity, usability, and inter-rater reliability.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A British group evaluated team performance in a standardized eclampsia drill before and after eclampsia management training [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Although all of the teams received training in eclampsia management, only half of the teams were randomly assigned to also receive formal training in teamwork theory, either at their local hospital or at a regional simulation center. Teamwork performance was evaluated using a validated global rating scale (5-point Likert) to rate areas of knowledge, behavior and overall performance [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Teamwork improved in all groups after eclampsia management training, but there was no additional benefit noted in those groups that also received teamwork training. The investigators suggested that the apparent lack of benefit of formal teamwork training may have been due to inadequate training in teamwork issues. It is also possible that simply receiving eclampsia education and rehearsing the eclampsia drill was sufficient to improve teamwork because of the relatively straightforward nature of eclampsia management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This conclusion was supported by a separate analysis of the participants' change in medical knowledge before and after training [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Medical knowledge was assessed using a 185 question, multiple-choice questionnaire, administered one to three weeks before the training and again one to three weeks afterwards. All of the teams had a 20-point increase in test scores after eclampsia education and drill training, but there was no difference between the teams with and without teamwork training.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">SIMULATION AND DRILLS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Simulation of obstetric procedures has become a common method of training individuals and teams to improve technical skills for treating emergency situations that occur infrequently. By simulating these situations, teams can learn and practice the required interventions in a safe environment, and thus potentially improve patient outcome when these situations actually occur on the labor unit. Simulation can also identify individual and team weaknesses [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Observations of many providers performing the same simulation can reveal the most common mistakes, allowing for development of appropriate and efficient curriculum for future training [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. Lastly, simulation can augment the perceived reduction in clinical experience due to mandated reductions in resident work hours [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>].</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) proposed a series of obstetric scenarios amenable to simulation training and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's simulation subcommittee developed a classification system for the characterization of evidence for simulation [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2314050508"><span class="h2">Summary of outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, the available data consistently show simulation training and drills improve performance by various measures, but there is less evidence for improvement in maternal or neonatal outcomes [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. A 2022 meta-analysis of four trials and 17 cohort studies that compared patient outcomes after obstetric team training versus no training reported some evidence of reduced brachial plexus injury following training but no impact on risk of Apgar score below 7 at five minutes [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The effect was unclear for reducing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, time to emergency cesarean delivery, or severe postpartum hemorrhage. Due to the heterogeneity of included training methods, conclusions about the best type and frequency of training could not be made.</p><p>The results of simulation drills in specific common obstetric emergencies are reviewed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Eclampsia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Eclampsia simulation has offered insights into individual, team, and system errors that can be prevented [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Realism can be added to the simulation of eclampsia and hemorrhage with modifications of commonly used models [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Improvement in task completion</strong> – A study performed in the United Kingdom compared team performance before and after eclampsia drill training [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Teams were randomly assigned to training at their local hospital or in a regional simulation center. After training, the teams completed more of the basic tasks required in the management of eclamptic patients, and these tasks were completed more quickly than prior to training. There were no differences between the teams trained locally or at a simulation center.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Opportunities for improvement</strong> – Another study of simulation to evaluate team management of eclampsia identified areas for improvement in the use of antihypertensive medications to treat severe hypertension and inconsistent use of checklists even when immediately available [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Shoulder dystocia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency with the potential for serious neonatal and/or maternal adverse outcome. It is usually unpredictable and unpreventable. Improper management of this emergency may worsen neonatal outcome, highlighting the need for adequate training of providers. The infrequent nature and special skills needed to manage shoulder dystocia combine to make it an obstetric emergency ideally suited for simulation. Also, there are evidence-based recommendations for the proper selection, sequence, and technique of maneuvers used to resolve shoulder dystocia; these recommendations can be used to develop training programs [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefits of training</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Improved simulation performance</strong> – Several studies have demonstrated improvement in management and documentation of a simulated shoulder dystocia event after training of residents and attending physicians [<a href="#rid44">44-46</a>]. Both low- and high-fidelity simulation of shoulder dystocia improved performance in the simulated event [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. However, there are no studies evaluating post-training team performance during actual patient events.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Reduced brachial plexus injury</strong> – Neonatal outcomes after team simulation training have been evaluated. Several studies have reported reductions in the frequency of brachial plexus injury associated with shoulder dystocia of at least two-thirds after training [<a href="#rid48">48-51</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In a single center Finnish study that compared the incidence of shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus injury before and after the institution of regular simulation training, training was associated with a higher rate (0.1 versus 0.3 percent) of shoulder dystocia but a lower rate of permanent brachial plexus injury (0.05 versus 0.02 percent) [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. In addition, delivery of the posterior arm was successful in more cases after training (11.3 versus 23.4 percent). Training consisted of regular three-hour sessions for a small team of midwives and physicians and monthly "walk-in" sessions for further practice. The training reviewed all techniques for resolving shoulder dystocia but placed emphasis on delivery of the posterior arm.

Training consisted of didactic and practical training on risk factors, diagnosis, and proper management of shoulder dystocia. The rate of shoulder dystocia was similar during both periods (approximately 2 percent), but neonatal brachial plexus injury fell significantly from 9.3 percent to 2.3 percent. A significant improvement was noted in use of appropriate management techniques (McRoberts' position, suprapubic pressure, internal rotation maneuvers, delivery of the posterior arm) and a significant decrease was also noted in inappropriate techniques (no recognized maneuvers performed, excessive traction, fundal pressure). Before training, the use of at least one correct maneuver was documented in only 49 percent of deliveries, versus 92 percent of deliveries after training. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A subsequent 12-year follow-up study reported a sustained reduction in brachial plexus injury at birth: 24/324 (7.4 percent, p &lt;0.01) pretraining, 6/262 (2.3 percent) early after training, and 7/562 (1.3 percent) late after training. The authors concluded that there are significant benefits to long-term, embedded training programs with improvements in management and outcomes.

The number of faculty capable of teaching the use of forceps is declining; teaching the proper use of obstetric forceps in the clinical setting is difficult because they are primarily used in urgent or emergency situations, and the key maneuvers of blade placement by the learner are done in the vagina, thus the teacher is blind to whether placement is correct until it is complete.</p><p>To overcome these obstacles, one group of investigators created a forceps simulation system using blades implanted with position sensors, allowing real-time and postsimulation evaluation of blade trajectory during placement [<a href="#rid58">58,59</a>]. Based on objective assessment of blade trajectory and repeatability of insertion technique, the investigators found that senior obstetricians performed forceps placements in an "excellent," "very good," or "good" manner 92 percent of the time, compared with only 38 percent of the time for junior obstetricians. They also observed that residents' skills progressed with more training, showing less hesitation and better following of a trajectory modeled by an expert operator [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].</p><p>A 2019 systematic review evaluated studies of operative vaginal delivery simulation in which provider or patient outcomes were reported [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

This training emphasized techniques to minimize maternal and neonatal injury and to reduce the number of failed instrumental deliveries. Operative vaginal delivery rates were 11 percent before, and 14 percent after, the training period, similar to the overall rate of operative vaginal delivery in the United States. A comparison between outcomes for all operative vaginal deliveries in the four months after initiation of the training program with that of a historical control group reported no statistically significant difference in the incidence of failed forceps or vacuum delivery or maternal anal sphincter injury. There was, however, a significant reduction in neonatal admissions to a special care nursery and in neonatal scalp and facial injuries.

Studies of simulation-based teaching of management of PPH have demonstrated that this approach identifies important deficiencies in clinician knowledge and performance [<a href="#rid33">33,64</a>]. Common management errors were delay in transporting the bleeding patient to the operating room, unfamiliarity with prostaglandin administration to reverse uterine atony, poor cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques, and delayed administration of blood products to reverse consumption coagulopathy [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. One study reported improvement in knowledge of clinical management of PPH, clinician confidence, and communication skills when assessed three months after training [<a href="#rid65">65</a>], and another reported improved skills of birth attendants to correctly perform bimanual uterine compression [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. There are data from developing countries demonstrating benefit of PPH training.

Participants then participated in a simulation session with immediate feedback, completed a multiple choice test, and took a confidence survey. Postintervention evaluation three weeks later showed significant improvement in simulation performance, knowledge and confidence.

The training session included a 40-minute practical workshop on shoulder dystocia management. Participants, including junior and senior physicians and midwives, performed a simulated delivery with a shoulder dystocia. The simulation ended when the participant delivered the posterior arm, elected to stop, or five minutes had elapsed. They were evaluated on whether delivery was successful, the head-to-body delivery interval, performance of appropriate actions, force applied, and communication.</p><p>Each participant did the simulation once before the training session and at three time points after training. The fetus with shoulder dystocia was successfully delivered in 49 percent of simulations before training, and in 82, 84, and 85 percent of simulations at 3 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after training, respectively. Additional training of the 18 percent of participants who were unable to deliver the fetus 3 weeks after training resulted in a 79 percent rate of successful delivery in this group at 12 months.</p><p>The investigators concluded that annual training is adequate for providers demonstrating competency after initial training. However, those that were unsuccessful three weeks after training should have remediation and be followed more closely to ensure retention of skills. This study also highlights the fact that providers do not all learn in the same way or at the same rate and that to achieve maximal benefit, some individualization of simulation training is required.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3276656798"><span class="h2">Implementation of simulation programs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the evidence for supporting the effectiveness of simulation and patient safety practices has increased, the ability to implement programs to positively impact clinical outcomes across multiple clinical sites and institutions is lacking. A group of five academic medical centers and affiliated hospitals identified key components for successfully initiating and implementing a shoulder dystocia simulation program, which included: involvement of clinician and nursing leadership from each academic medical center, administrative and logistic support from a liability insurer, development of consensus on curriculum components of simulation curriculum, conduct of a gap and barrier analysis, financial support from insurer to close necessary gaps and mitigate barriers, and creation of dashboards and tracking program performance [<a href="#rid74">74</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">CHECKLISTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Checklists are available from several sources, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>World Health Organization <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fteams%2Fintegrated-health-services%2Fpatient-safety%2Fresearch%2Fsafe-childbirth&amp;token=eXz5nhl42JedQOWuDqugT0gPus9br1lxptYYTCupo7F2ESMAhfGFgMmShca8b5FYwJOyxl1Rttupg67Q5SdnBwL08yowHYiDd7Jb0TV6VrC5m0Ixbq0jaiAxqc9SBGNw&amp;TOPIC_ID=4463" target="_blank">safe childbirth checklist</a></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smfm.org%2F&amp;token=FWNID0ZRoEvvwjKjY4KwHWynijd8%2FDjTDgIieXWEo8k%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=4463" target="_blank">The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine</a></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Oxytocin administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">Oxytocin</a> is a commonly used medication to stimulate labor. While many dose regimens have been evaluated, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a dosing protocol that is appropriate for all patients. The best dose regimen likely varies among patients or types of patients. It is possible, however, that more uniform practice could improve safety. Some experts recommend oxytocin protocols, which emphasize strict maternal and fetal criteria when administering the medication, the use of low initial doses with infrequent dose increases, and strong collaboration between physicians and nurses.

The pre-oxytocin checklist required adequate documentation that the patient was an appropriate candidate for labor (appropriate estimated fetal weight, fetal presentation, clinical pelvimetry, fetal assessment, etc). An "in-use" oxytocin checklist included fetal assessment by heart rate pattern and uterine assessment by pattern and strength of contractions (either by palpation or with an intrauterine pressure catheter); this checklist was to be completed every 30 minutes while the patient received the medication. If all of the items on the checklist could not be completed, then the oxytocin infusion was reduced or stopped.
