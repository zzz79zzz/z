A basic approach to PFT for the primary care provider is presented here. The goal is to encourage pediatric primary care clinicians to obtain PFT to diagnose and monitor the pathophysiologic aspects of their patients' respiratory conditions, thereby improving management.</p><p>Conventional tests that are frequently performed in the evaluation of pediatric respiratory conditions include measurements that identify:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Airway obstruction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Restrictive lung, chest wall, and respiratory muscle defects</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diffusion defects (those that impair diffusion of gas through the alveolar-capillary membrane)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respiratory muscle weakness</p><p></p><p>Measurements of flow and volume are most useful in the office setting. Spirometry, which provides both these measures, requires neither sophisticated technology nor expensive equipment, is easily interpreted, and is reliable when performed correctly. A brief discussion of the technique, clinical applications for and limitations of more sophisticated measurements of lung volume, diffusion capacity, and respiratory muscle function also is provided so that referrals for such testing can be made appropriately.</p><p>Readers interested in a more comprehensive review of PFT in children are referred elsewhere [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Interpretation of arterial blood gas analyses and exhaled nitric oxide, exercise testing, assessment of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, sleep studies, measurements of control of breathing, and PFT in adults are discussed separately.

PFT is also used for monitoring disease progression and prognosis. Forced vital capacity (FVC), for example, is a key parameter to monitor for progression of effects of scoliosis on the lungs, while forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) has prognostic value with regards to mortality in some diseases such as CF.</p><p>The asthma guidelines of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] both use spirometric values to classify asthma severity and subsequent ongoing determination of asthma control to guide asthma management. The development of compact and affordable instruments enables pediatric lung function testing in the primary care setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">SPIROMETRY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spirometry is the measurement of air flow over time. It includes measures of volume and flow generated by a forced and complete exhalation from full lung volume to residual volume (RV) after a full inspiration. The volume-time curve graphic presentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55440" href="/z/d/graphic/55440.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) has been largely replaced in clinical practice by the flow-volume curve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75916" href="/z/d/graphic/75916.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58092" href="/z/d/graphic/58092.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), which provides a more immediate visual and intuitive perception of obstructive and restrictive disorders. However, the two graphic depictions are complementary and optimally should be analyzed together. Spirometry also includes the measurement of flow and volume with inspiration; however, inspiratory parameters that are predominantly indicators of extrathoracic obstruction are less commonly measured and are not discussed here. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1465.html" rel="external">"Flow-volume loops"</a>.)</p><p>Production of a reliable, sustained expiration requires coaching from the clinician and both coordination and focus on the part of the subject. Thus, quality spirometry is usually not reliable in children younger than six years. However, exceptions exist, and even lesser-quality measurements may have clinical value as well as serving as a training opportunity for future measurements in the younger child. Modern spirometers are often equipped with software with age-adjusted animated incentives that help coach the young child through the respiratory maneuver using a dynamic graphic display.</p><p>Spirometry is most useful for evaluation of common pediatric obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis, and the sequelae of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</p><p>The following discussion of spirometry focuses on the measured parameters, interpretation, and clinical applications most relevant to the primary care provider. Methodology and interpretation of spirometry in children are discussed in greater detail in guidelines published by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], accessed through the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoracic.org%2Fstatements%2F&amp;token=Pby%2FnGkMB8TdW5V6epNUr3SRsNf6YBT3Fr3MIDgZvpZGvZXjM5qSgaeGcxqQwZtc&amp;TOPIC_ID=5735" target="_blank">ATS website</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Measured parameters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The key parameters derived from spirometry include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Indices of volume:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Forced vital capacity (FVC)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Slow vital capacity (SVC) performed with a submaximal expiratory effort (nonstandard)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Indices of flow:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Flow between 25 and 75 percent of the vital capacity (FEF25-75%), also known as the maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMEFR)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)</p><p></p><p>The air remaining in the lungs at the end of expiration (RV) cannot be measured by spirometry.

As a general rule, obstructive disorders affect indices of flow, and restrictive disorders affect indices of volume. Combined restrictive and obstructive defects may be more challenging to interpret. Any reduction in FVC exceeding 80 percent of predicted value may indicate a restrictive disorder. These patients can be referred to a pulmonary function laboratory for additional testing.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flow</strong> – FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEF25-75%, and PEFR are decreased in obstructive disorders. FEF25-75% is generally viewed as representative of flow in smaller conducting airways. It is less effort dependent than the other measurements, and is especially useful in picking up milder intrathoracic airway obstruction. It may be reduced by 25 percent or more even while the patient is symptom free and/or has a normal lung examination and in the presence of normal FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEFR [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], As such, it is often a sensitive diagnostic tool for subtle morbidity, such as mild asthma. Reduction in FEF25-75% is visually reflected by scooping of the descending limb of the flow-volume curve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58092" href="/z/d/graphic/58092.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Volume</strong> – FVC is often decreased in restrictive disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55880" href="/z/d/graphic/55880.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). However, such decreases may be misleading in that the FVC may also be reduced due to air trapping in obstructive defects. Restrictive disorders may also reduce flow. FEV1, a measure of volume over time, is reduced because it is affected by the total volume available for exhalation, the FVC. Thus, a restrictive disorder should be considered when flow indices are proportionally reduced with the FVC. This is done by assessing the FEV<sub>1</sub>/ FVC ratio, normally &gt;85 percent. When the FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> are symmetrically reduced with a normal ratio, this suggests that the decrease in airflow may be due to volume reduction rather than to obstructed flow. In this setting, measurements of lung volume using methods that are typically unavailable in the primary care setting should be undertaken to confirm the restrictive respiratory disorder. (See <a class="local">'Lung volume measurement'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Flow-volume curve</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The flow-volume curve is a graphic representation of individual forced inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers. It is included in most spirometry reports, although only the expiratory limb is typically displayed and analyzed in standard clinical conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75916" href="/z/d/graphic/75916.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Obstructive defects usually manifest as scooping of the descending limb of the curve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58092" href="/z/d/graphic/58092.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), a change that can be easily detected by visual inspection. The graphic display of the flow-volume curve also provides the most effective measure of quality control. Good technical performance of the expiratory maneuver should lead to reproducible repeated maneuvers for a patient. As such, reliable measurements should have at least three flow-volume curves that can be closely superimposed graphically.</p><p>Examination of the inspiratory flow-volume curve is helpful when flow obstruction derives from the extrathoracic airways, most commonly in the larynx or upper trachea. These often useful parameters are not always included in the flow-volume curves reported by standard spirometers. Flow-volume patterns in upper-airway obstruction are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1465.html" rel="external">"Flow-volume loops"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4563009"><span class="h2">Use of spirometry in asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Office spirometry is a valuable tool for primary care clinicians to use in the evaluation and management of their patients with asthma. It can be used to support a diagnosis of asthma by demonstrating reversible airflow obstruction. This may be particularly helpful in children with isolated symptoms (eg, persistent cough, exercise intolerance) or atypical or equivocal presentations. In such patients, spirometry may also guide the clinician to an alternative diagnosis (eg, restrictive lung disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5742.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Once an obstructive pattern has been identified on spirometry, the reversibility of the obstruction can be assessed by measuring FEV<sub>1</sub> before and after inhalation of a bronchodilating agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13290" href="/z/d/drug information/13290.html" rel="external">albuterol</a>). As a general rule, persons without bronchial hyperreactivity have a &lt;5 percent increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> after inhalation of a bronchodilator [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A postbronchodilator increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of &gt;12 percent and 200 mL constitutes a reversible obstructive lung defect and supports the diagnosis of asthma. However, this definition for bronchodilator response (BDR) positivity was established in adults. An increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of ≥8 percent may be a better definition for BDR in children, although it remains an insensitive test [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>].</p><p>The interpretation of airway reactivity should be viewed with caution, particularly with borderline results. The degree of reversible obstruction can vary from one visit to the next, and the ongoing use of bronchodilators, particularly long-acting muscarinic antagonists (eg <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12953" href="/z/d/drug information/12953.html" rel="external">tiotropium</a>), may persist for up to 48 hours, impacting the degree of reversibility measured [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Positive bronchodilator responses may be seen in children who have FEV<sub>1</sub> &gt;110 percent predicted as their baseline values. These children may still demonstrate sufficient improvement to confirm reversible airway obstruction that suggests asthma. Other features of asthma, such as clinical response to bronchodilators, should be taken into account when making the diagnosis in children with mild asthma to buttress the finding of changes in lung function after a bronchodilator.</p><p>Monitoring of asthma with spirometry, used in conjunction with daily symptoms and exacerbation frequency, is also useful in evaluating response to therapy and changes in asthma severity over time in children with asthma [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Performance of spirometry at the start of treatment and during the first six months of follow-up were both associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization in the subsequent year in 27,193 Danish children aged 6 to 14 years with asthma [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Regular measurements in children with uncomplicated asthma are recommended by multiple asthma guidelines, such as the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>The midexpiratory flows measure (FEF25-75%), while highly variable in repeat measurements, may also be a sensitive parameter to indicate an obstructive defect since it may be reduced in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic and have a normal FEV<sub>1</sub> [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Barriers to performance of spirometry in the primary care setting include poor technique due to lack of time and training, particularly in interpretation of results [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Peak expiratory flow rate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The PEFR measurement (often referred to as the peak flow measurement), unlike full spirometry, requires only a short expiratory blast, without the subject having to sustain a prolonged expiratory effort, and is therefore feasible for younger children four to six years of age. Typically, the highest of three PEFRs is reported. The portability and ease of use of inexpensive versions of the Wright Peak Flow Meter have made this device commonplace in the primary care setting and the home.</p><p>PEFR meters should not be viewed as "the poor man's spirometer," though they do have several important limitations [<a href="#rid7">7,15,16</a>]. The measurements obtained by PEFR meters are highly effort dependent and can be manipulated by children [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In addition, intrapersonal variability can be substantial and is particularly affected by circadian rhythms (although diurnal variability is a notable characteristic of asthma, with symptoms increasing at night concurrent to the ebb in endogenous glucocorticoid production). Because mini peak flow meters are not precise tools, wide variation of recorded PEFR can be observed between devices, even of the same brand. Thus, measurements performed by devices other than those customarily used by the patient should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Peak flow meters have a limited role in establishing the diagnosis of asthma in the office. However, they can be useful in gauging the severity of asthma exacerbations, both by comparing PEFR measurements with population-specific normative data  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64420" href="/z/d/graphic/64420.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] and, more importantly, to preestablished baseline ("personal best") values. Such PEFR measurements are commonly used to assist in determining levels of interventions according to predetermined asthma management plans (Action Plans). The optional use of PEFR has also been incorporated into the NAEPP guidelines for asthma management [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The use of PEFR monitoring in asthma is discussed in detail separately.

The measurement of lung volumes is important in clinical conditions in which a restrictive lung defect and/or air trapping may be present. It is also important when addressing possible diffusion capacity defects. The partitioning of lung volumes is depicted in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55440" href="/z/d/graphic/55440.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

The thoracic gas volume (TGV) measured equals FRC because the measurement is begun at end expiration, after a stable baseline end-expiratory volume is achieved. The FRC is unobtainable by spirometry since it includes the residual volume (RV). The use of spirometry together with measures of FRC allows division of lung volumes, as depicted in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55440" href="/z/d/graphic/55440.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Demonstration of reduced total lung capacity (TLC) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of restrictive respiratory disease in both adults and children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Plethysmography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Plethysmography involves placing the child inside a whole-body plethysmograph or “body box,” a sealed structure similar to a telephone booth. This is typically done with the child alone, although the measurements can be performed with the child seated on the lap of a parent or caregiver. The plethysmograph is tightly sealed, and the child is asked to breathe normally at tidal volume (TV) through a mouthpiece.</p><p>The TV is measured, and the mouthpiece is briefly occluded by a shutter at end expiration (FRC). With the child panting against the closed shutter, pressure oscillations are simultaneously measured at the mouthpiece and within the plethysmograph. This maneuver results in alternating compression and decompression of the intrathoracic gas, which is measured at the mouth and within the box. By employing Boyle's law, which states that the product of pressure and volume remains constant in a closed system (P1V1 = P2V2), the FRC is calculated.</p><p>Plethysmography requires cooperation on the part of the subject and is therefore difficult to obtain in children younger than six years. Reliance on complex maneuvers, such as panting against a closed shutter, is the major limitation. In addition, some children find enclosure within the plethysmograph frightening.</p><p>To conform to repeatability standards, at least three FRC<sub>pleth</sub> measurements should be obtained that are within 5 percent of each other.</p><p>Plethysmography measures the total gas volume, including areas not communicating with the central airways (eg, cysts, areas distal to airway obstruction), while gas dilution measures only those areas of the lungs in direct communication with the measurement apparatus. Dilution techniques, therefore, will underestimate FRC in conditions in which there is significant air trapping. Thus, plethysmography is preferred in obstructive conditions, in which air trapping may occur [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>Novel technologies of integrated apparatus that use methods that are less demanding for patients and hence offer novel opportunities for total PFTs in children are discussed below.

Gas dilution methods require less cooperation from the child compared with plethysmography. These methods are a good alternative for patients who cannot physically fit in a plethysmograph (eg, children who require full-time wheelchair use) or those who experience claustrophobia when sitting in the sealed body box. A sealed face mask for gas dilution testing can be used in children whose buccal musculature is too weak to maintain a seal around a mouthpiece.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the multiple breath helium dilution method, the subject inhales a gas mixture containing a known concentration of helium in a known volume; the subject continues to inhale and exhale into a closed circuit until equilibrium is obtained.

A rapid nitrogen analyzer measures the exhaled nitrogen in each exhalate as it is "washed out" with the 100 percent oxygen being inhaled. The volume of exhaled nitrogen is measured throughout the procedure.

These changes may be the earliest abnormalities detected in early airway pathologies, such as cystic fibrosis (CF).

The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and alveolar volume (VA) are measured in conditions in which impairment of gas diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane or a reduction in the alveolar-capillary surface area is suspected (eg, in children with exercise intolerance unrelated to bronchospasm, especially when associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturation, unexplained dyspnea or hypoxemia, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary fibrosis). The DLCO is used diagnostically to detect the presence of diffusion abnormalities when diseases of the pulmonary interstitium or vasculitis are suspected. It is often used clinically to track effects of interventions for those diseases or side effects of therapies or interventions known to cause pulmonary fibrosis (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13088" href="/z/d/drug information/13088.html" rel="external">bleomycin</a> and bone marrow transplantation, respectively).</p><p>As with other PFT measurements, proper technique of performance is critical to accurately interpret the data collected [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Less frequently, pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular diseases, including vasculitides associated with rheumatologic disease, can also reduce DLCO. The DLCO is increased above the normal range in pulmonary hemorrhage due to the presence of hemoglobin within the alveoli. It may also be increased if the Vi is less than 90 percent of VC.

The measurement of lung volume in this system includes spirometry and a tidal breathing maneuver in which periodic interruptions are introduced automatically by the device. The technique is based in part upon comparing gas pressures and airflows between the subject and a known reservoir. It also offers single-breath DLCO testing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another device<strong> </strong>also requires no sealed box and is not based on Boyle's law. Lung volume calculation is determined by helium dilution. The air of the thorax equilibrates with a known volume of air containing a small concentration of helium or methane. The final dilution of these gases is used to calculate the total volume of air in the thorax. This technique does not measure air that does not communicate with the airway, (eg, air within cysts or bullae). It does measure the lung clearance index (LCI) by applying the multiple breath nitrogen washout technique [<a href="#rid26">26-28</a>]. The device measures the starting amount of nitrogen concentration when the patient initiates the maneuver. The patient is then switched to tidal breathing on 100 percent oxygen. The rate of clearing nitrogen from the lungs determines LCI, and total lung capacity can be calculated by integrating the total amount of exhaled nitrogen and dividing this volume by the initial nitrogen concentration.</p><p></p><p>Both these devices consolidate advanced and often complex measurements of pulmonary functions into a single compact device. They also eliminate cabin-based plethysmography and reduce maneuvers such as panting and, with that, facilitate difficult measurements and render the determination of the related parameters more achievable. This is particularly attractive for pediatrics, where studies beyond spirometry are often not feasible in the younger child. Publications from the adult literature confirm good agreement between the various parameters measured by these two devices when compared with the conventional measuring devices; however, such comparisons have not been published for pediatrics. Hence, caution should be exercised by the pediatric practitioner in prematurely relying on these devices until such time that pediatric-based comparative studies are published.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h1">RESPIRATORY MUSCLE PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Determinations of respiratory muscle pressures are typically measured in specialized centers.
