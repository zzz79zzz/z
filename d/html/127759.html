The virus was designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness it caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The spectrum of COVID-19 in adults ranges from asymptomatic infection to mild respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction. Our understanding of the spectrum of disease as well as optimal management strategies continues to evolve, particularly with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p>This topic will address the evaluation of adult patients with acute COVID-19 (eg, the first few weeks of illness onset) in the outpatient setting, including initial telephone triage, telehealth and outpatient evaluation, and when to refer to the emergency department or hospital. Data informing outpatient management strategies continue to evolve, and the approach described here is based upon a rapidly developing evidence base. In addition, clinicians should take into account an individual patient's circumstances as well as available local resources when considering management options.</p><p>The treatment of COVID-19 in adult patients in the outpatient setting is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/139068.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting"</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation and management of COVID-19 in pregnant patients is discussed separately.

Therefore, the focus of our evaluation of patients with COVID-19 is to provide a timely assessment that includes the timing of symptom onset, risk factors for hospitalization and death, and overall acuity of illness. This assessment permits us to determine who are appropriate candidates for COVID-19-specific treatment and, when appropriate, the best setting (eg, telehealth, outpatient clinic, emergency department) for treatment. (See <a class="local">'Telephone triage'</a> below and <a class="local">'Determine eligibility for COVID-19 outpatient treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Continuum of care</strong> – When possible, we favor evaluating and managing all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 within an outpatient continuum of care management program that includes initial telephone triage with availability of telehealth or in-person clinician evaluation, if appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Telephone triage'</a> below and <a class="local">'Initial clinical evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rationale for outpatient management and remote care</strong> – Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients with COVID-19; in the majority of patients, illness is mild and does not warrant medical intervention or hospitalization [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In addition, remote (telehealth) management is preferred for most patients for the following reasons:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Remote management can prevent unnecessary in-person medical visits to urgent care facilities, primary care clinics, and emergency departments.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In-person health care provider visits require the patient to leave their home, traveling via public, private, or emergency transport and potentially exposing others to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, upon arrival at a health care facility, patients may expose other patients and health care workers to the virus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Telehealth has been used for patient management during previous disease outbreaks, including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza A H1N1 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Remote evaluation and management of patients with COVID-19 continues to be evaluated, and there is accumulating evidence demonstrating the appropriateness and efficacy of this approach [<a href="#rid4">4-9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Telehealth evaluation for COVID-19 can be performed by telephone call, video-based telemedicine platform, or commercial video chat platform; the format chosen should be compliant with applicable patient privacy regulations [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128313.html" rel="external">"Telemedicine for adults", section on 'The telemedicine visit'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flexibility in approach to care</strong> – High-quality data supporting the superiority of any single outpatient management strategy are lacking, and treatment protocols are being developed and modified as understanding of the disease evolves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Our approach is based upon guidelines [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], as well as our own clinical experience of treating patients with COVID-19, and places additional emphasis on avoiding infection transmission and avoiding unnecessary health care usage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Prevention'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'When PPE is limited'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additionally, institutions may need to revise protocols, even in near real time, in response to surges in the number of patients with suspected infection they are managing [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H823481561"><span class="h1">TELEPHONE TRIAGE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients who have concerns about COVID-19, even those with mild symptoms, will likely initiate contact with the health care system. For those patients, initial telephone triage to determine need for further evaluation is the preferred initial management approach [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. The initial triage call should be conducted by clinical staff trained in assessing the acuteness of illness, eliciting risk factors for severe disease, and determining which patients are appropriate for self-care at home and which patients warrant a timely clinician telehealth visit (televisit) or an in-person visit [<a href="#rid11">11,16</a>]. Each of the aspects to be covered in the triage call are discussed in detail below in the section on initial clinical evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1154959081"><span class="h1">INITIAL CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial evaluation includes ensuring early diagnostic testing (if necessary); assessing acuity of illness and social factors; excluding other causes of symptoms; determining whether laboratory testing, imaging, or treatment is necessary; and counseling. Some aspects of the initial evaluation may be conducted during telephone triage while others may be performed during a televisit call with a clinician. (See <a class="local">'Determine eligibility for COVID-19 outpatient treatment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Counseling'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H446368702"><span class="h2">Ensure early diagnostic testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection at the earliest possible opportunity is a key step in management. Patients presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who received COVID-19 vaccination and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="134627" href="/z/d/drug information/134627.html" rel="external">tixagevimab-cilgavimab</a> should still be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as vaccines and preexposure prophylaxis may not be as effective against the newer variants of the virus and immunity wanes over time.</p><p>If a patient with suspected infection has not been tested, we suggest home testing or referral to a local testing center. In a symptomatic patient, we consider a positive antigen test or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to be diagnostic of infection, regardless of where testing was performed (eg, at home or in a clinical setting)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128419" href="/z/d/graphic/128419.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). An initial negative antigen test in symptomatic patients generally warrants a repeat test  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134206" href="/z/d/graphic/134206.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The diagnosis of COVID-19 is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Diagnosis", section on 'NAAT (including RT-PCR)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Diagnosis", section on 'Antigen testing'</a>.)</p><p>Antibody detection has no utility for diagnosis in the acute outpatient setting; we do not use serology to exclude or diagnose acute COVID-19 infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128404.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Diagnosis", section on 'Serology to identify prior/late infection'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H931164845"><span class="h2">Assess acuity of illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We assess the patient's overall acuity level by asking questions regarding dyspnea, chest pain/pressure, orthostasis, dizziness, falls, hypotension (if home blood pressure measurement is available), mental status change (eg, lethargy, confusion, change in behavior, difficulty in rousing), observed cyanosis, and urine output. Presence of any of these symptoms is concerning and warrants in-person evaluation. Most patients without moderate or severe acuity of illness can remain at home for initial management. Mild orthostasis symptoms may be addressed with instruction to increase fluids.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dyspnea</strong> – Worsening dyspnea, particularly dyspnea at rest, and more severe chest discomfort/tightness are concerning symptoms and suggest the development or progression of pulmonary involvement. The trajectory of dyspnea over the days following its onset is particularly important, as significant worsening and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can manifest soon after the onset of dyspnea; in initial studies among COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS, progression to ARDS occurred a median of 2.5 days after onset of dyspnea [<a href="#rid17">17-21</a>]. Dyspnea, along with risk factors for developing severe disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127477" href="/z/d/graphic/127477.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), can be used to guide clinicians in determining whether a patient requires in-person evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Disposition'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We use this assessment to categorize dyspnea by severity:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mild dyspnea – Dyspnea that does not interfere with daily activities (eg, mild shortness of breath with activities such as climbing one to two flights of stairs or walking briskly).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Moderate dyspnea – Dyspnea that creates limitations to activities of daily living (eg, shortness of breath that limits the ability to walk up one flight of stairs without needing to rest or interferes with meal preparation and light housekeeping tasks).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe dyspnea – Dyspnea that causes shortness of breath at rest, renders the patient unable to speak in complete sentences, and interferes with basic activities such as toileting and dressing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypoxia</strong> – Dyspnea may not correlate with the presence or degree of hypoxia in all patients [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. If a patient with COVID-19 reports the results of a home pulse oximeter, we consider the oxygen saturation as an additional piece of information to assess their clinical status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, oximetry should only be considered within the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation; a normal oxygen saturation level cannot be used to exclude clinically significant respiratory involvement in a patient with concerning symptoms such as progressive or severe dyspnea or high overall acuity level. Further, the addition of remote oximetry to dyspnea monitoring has not been shown to improve patient outcomes [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Although normal oximetry can be reassuring, results may be not always be accurate, particularly in patients with darker skin pigmentation [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>], and there is no guarantee that respiratory status will not deteriorate as illness progresses.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We do not advise that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 purchase a pulse oximeter. Further, we do not consider oxygen saturation readings obtained through an application ("app") on a mobile telephone accurate enough to depend upon for clinical use [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The use of home oximetry monitoring is being evaluated for patients seen in the ambulatory or emergency department setting and discharged home [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, there is no high-quality evidence that patient outcomes are improved using this approach.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962471222"><span class="h2">Assess home setting and social factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We assess the ability of patients to monitor their symptoms and to understand the importance of seeking medical attention should symptoms progress. Patients who lack the ability to self-monitor and self-report may need more intensive staff outreach to be adequately managed at home.</p><p>In addition, we assess if the patient's residential setting is appropriate for home management and recovery [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]; patients managed at home should be capable of adhering to appropriate infection control and isolation precautions for the duration of illness and recovery (including using a separate bedroom if not living alone)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139926" href="/z/d/graphic/139926.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Other important home resources include an available caregiver, adequate access to food, and assistance with activities of daily living if necessary. Whether the patient has any household members who have risk factors for severe disease is another consideration  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127477" href="/z/d/graphic/127477.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Infection prevention in the home setting'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4047151705"><span class="h2">Exclude other causes of symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As part of the evaluation, we assess for other potential causes of symptoms. Given the high prevalence and mild symptoms of most COVID-19 infections, clinicians should not assume that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a patient’s illness when a positive home rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 is reported. Clinicians should be mindful that the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be incidental to the clinical process and have a low threshold to evaluate patients in person to determine if an alternative process is responsible for the symptoms. Given the decreasing acuity of symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infections due to widespread immunization, immunity from previous infections, and prevalence of new variants associated with milder infection, it is increasingly important to evaluate all patients with moderate or severe illness to confirm that an alternative disease process is not responsible for the clinical presentation.</p><p>The typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies depending upon the individual's vaccination status and the particular SAR-CoV-2 variant  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131216" href="/z/d/graphic/131216.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Patients typically experience a viral-type illness with symptoms ranging from a mild upper respiratory tract infection (eg, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea) to a lower respiratory tract infection (eg, cough, fever), influenza-like symptoms (eg, fever, chills, headache, myalgias), or gastroenteritis (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127890" href="/z/d/graphic/127890.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].
