         Therapeutic apheresis (TA) is an extracorporeal treatment that selectively removes abnormal cells or substances in the blood that are associated with or cause certain disease states. It can also be used to administer cells or plasma constituents that are present in subtherapeutic concentrations.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of indications for which TA is used and practical information for performing apheresis are presented here. Many indications for TA are presented in separate reviews about specific clinical conditions treated with TA.

        <p>
         Complications of TA are discussed separately. (See

TPE is also referred to as plasma exchange or therapeutic plasmapheresis and involves removal of patient plasma and replacement with allogeneic or autologous plasma. Plasma removed during plasma exchange must not be used for transfusion to another individual, according to regulations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

          Rationale and benefits of therapeutic apheresis

         </span>
         The basic premise of TA is that by removing or decreasing levels of certain pathologic substances from the plasma, prevention of further damage or reversal of a pathologic process can occur  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60280" href="/z/d/graphic/60280.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The pathologic substance may be an autoantibody, immune complex, cryoglobulin, myeloma light chains, endotoxin, cholesterol-containing lipoprotein, or other substances.
        </p>
        <p>
         TA involves the passing of venous blood through an extracorporeal device that separates blood into its components, cells and plasma, shunts much of the targeted pathologic cells or plasma into a discard container and returns most of the remaining blood to the patient along with replacement fluid and normal cells and a short-acting anticoagulant, usually citrate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Potential replacement fluids include the patient's own plasma from which an unwanted substance has been removed, or allogeneic (donor) plasma, colloid, or crystalloid. In some cases, use of allogeneic plasma is preferred because it provides needed proteins, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, or other substances. However, allogeneic plasma should only be used as replacement fluid for specific indications such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) that is associated with ADAMTS13 deficiency. In other clinical situations, use of appropriate non-plasma replacement fluid eliminates unnecessary exposure to allogeneic plasma.
        </p>
        <p>
         At least one of the following conditions must be present for therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) to be considered as a rational therapeutic choice:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The substance targeted for removal must have a sufficiently long half-life so that extracorporeal removal is more rapid than endogenous clearance pathways.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The substance to be removed must be acutely toxic and/or resistant to conventional therapy so that rapid elimination from the extracellular fluid by TA is indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The substance to be removed should be large, with a molecular weight &gt;15,000 daltons, so that it cannot be easily removed by less expensive purification techniques such as hemofiltration or high-flux hemodialysis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         TA is highly effective for the removal of pathologic autoantibodies. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) has an average molecular weight &gt;150,000 daltons and a half-life of approximately 21 days [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Thus, even if immunosuppressive therapy could immediately inhibit new antibody production, the plasma concentration would decrease by only approximately 50 percent within 21 days. Such a delay may not be acceptable with an aggressive autoantibody such as that seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3085.html" rel="external">
          "Anti-GBM (Goodpasture) disease: Treatment and prognosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         TA has other potential benefits, including unloading of the reticuloendothelial system, which can enhance endogenous removal of circulating toxins; stimulation of lymphocyte clones to enhance cytotoxic therapy; and the possibility of reinfusing plasma volumes in such a way that the risk of intravascular volume overload can be decreased [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The infusion of allogeneic plasma is particularly important in immune or congenital TTP. For immune TTP, TPE using plasma as replacement fluid may be lifesaving. TPE works in TTP both by removing very high molecular weight von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers and autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 (the VWF multimer-cleaving protease), as well as by providing ADAMTS13. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1344.html" rel="external">
          "Immune TTP: Initial treatment"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For some indications, TA is considered first-line therapy (eg, TTP, acute Guillain-Barré syndrome), whereas for others such as light chain cast nephropathy in multiple myeloma, apheresis may need to be used in combination with other established treatments such as chemotherapy to inhibit antibody production.

          —
         </span>
         In the United States, most TA procedures are performed for neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic diseases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86468" href="/z/d/graphic/86468.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). A collaborative survey by the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) and the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) showed that more than one-half of all procedures were performed for neurologic conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The Canadian Apheresis Group has reported a growing use of TA for hematologic disorders, which constituted 55 percent of all TA procedures in 2003; use of TA for neurologic conditions had decreased from 50 percent in 1988 to 40 percent in 2003 [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. This change reflects the growing use of evidence-based practice and advances in pharmacologic treatments that in some instances replace apheresis as standard treatment for some conditions.

         Previously, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis were treated with TA, but this practice often was not based on data from controlled studies. Use of this complex and expensive treatment in the absence of supporting data prompted the development of evidence-based guidelines rather than reliance on anecdotal reports or data from small series or uncontrolled trials  (

         A comprehensive review of indications for TA based on literature reviews is published approximately every two to three years by the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) [

         ]. Conditions are assigned to one of four categories based on evidence of clinical efficacy as determined by evaluation of peer-reviewed literature. These guidelines are not intended to mandate TA for conditions in which it is clearly not effective, nor are they intended to deny or exclude patients from receiving TA when a benefit may be potentially achievable. Given the complexity and expense of the procedure, however, the guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making.

         Opinions and small studies regarding TA for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or COVID-19 syndromes such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or hyperviscosity have been published, but standards-of-practice guidelines have not been determined. A 2021 International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) Working Group preliminarily suggested a role for TA in treating COVID-19-associated syndromes, particularly CRS, applying ASFA guidelines for multiple organ dysfunction to assign a category III, 2B classification to COVID-19-associated CRS; however, the authors cited lack of high-quality evidence for TA [

         Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is most commonly performed with centrifugation devices referred to as apheresis instruments, also used for blood component collection in healthy donors. These instruments offer the additional advantage of allowing selective cell removal (cytapheresis).

         Successful TA requires reliable vascular access, which may consist of two large, durable peripheral veins or a central dual-lumen catheter that is adequately rigid to withstand significant flow pressures; appropriate lines are apheresis/dialysis catheters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiographic confirmation of catheter placement is critical to prevent perforation of adjacent tissues or organs and also because cardiac arrhythmias may result if citrate anticoagulant, which binds ionized calcium, is infused in close proximity to the sinoatrial node.
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of peripheral veins may avoid complications associated with central venous catheters but is associated with slower blood flow and longer procedures that may eventually render peripheral veins ineffective or create patient discomfort. It may be more practical to insert a central catheter to manage conditions that warrant several procedures over a longer period of time.

         For most conditions, it has become standard practice to perform 1 to 1.5 plasma volume exchanges per procedure. Exchange of the first 1 to 1.5 plasma volumes removes the greatest concentration of the targeted substance, with diminishing amounts removed in each subsequent exchange procedure. A single plasma volume exchange in an average-sized adult uses approximately 3 liters of replacement fluid.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, large molecular weight compounds equilibrate slowly between the vascular space and the interstitium. Thus, calculations of the rate of removal by TA can be simplified to first-order kinetics. A single plasma volume exchange will lower plasma macromolecule levels by 60 percent, and an exchange equal to 1.4 times the plasma volume will lower plasma levels by 75 percent [

         Exchanging more than 1 to 1.5 plasma volumes in a single treatment increases procedure time, challenges patient tolerance, and increases cost. As an example, cell separators can perform one complete volume exchange in 1.5 to 2 hours; two to three plasma exchanges will double or triple the time required to perform the procedure.

         The optimal choice often varies with the clinical setting. Albumin is used for most conditions; normal

         ) combination as the replacement fluid, rather than normal saline alone. It is generally recommended that plasma only be used as the replacement fluid for conditions in which constituents of plasma are necessary, such as in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Albumin 25 percent should not be used unless it is diluted to 5 percent concentration by the hospital pharmacy.

         – When colloid and crystalloid solutions are used in combination, the amount of colloid should not be less than 50 percent of the total infused. An appropriate replacement solution would consist of 1:1 ratio of 5 percent albumin to whole blood and a 2:1 ratio of

         – Normal saline alone provides insufficient oncotic pressure and tends to lead to significant edema and/or hypotension.

         The TA schedule should be based on the nature of the targeted pathologic substance and by the desired endpoint, (eg, clinical improvement or reduction in the level of the pathologic entity). In immunologically mediated, paraproteinemic, or hyperviscosity conditions, immunoglobulin compartmental shifts, especially of IgG and IgM, must be considered [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In many of these cases, TA only serves an adjunct role, as the patients are receiving concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy.

          14,17

         ]. IgG production is also characterized by a "rebound" phenomenon, especially if the patient is not on immunosuppressive therapy. Consequently, a more rigorous regimen involving several TA procedures and the institution of immunosuppressive therapy are important to significantly reduce IgG levels [
         <a href="#rid22">

        <p>
         If, as a result of concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, one assumes a negligible production rate of immunoglobulin, and the rate of extravascular to intravascular equilibration to be approximately 1 to 2 percent per hour, then five separate procedures over 7 to 10 days are required to remove 90 percent of the total initial body immunoglobulin burden [

         – Therapeutic apheresis (TA; plasma exchange or cytapheresis) is an extracorporeal technique for the removal of large molecular weight substances or cells from the blood or plasma, respectively. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Indications (general principles)
         </strong>
         – For apheresis to be an appropriate therapeutic choice, the substance to be removed should be sufficiently large so that it cannot be easily removed by hemofiltration or high-flux hemodialysis, must have a sufficiently long half-life, or must be acutely toxic and/or resistant to conventional therapy. Examples include pathogenic autoantibodies, immune complexes, cryoglobulins, myeloma light chains, endotoxin, cholesterol-containing lipoproteins. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rationale and benefits of therapeutic apheresis'

         <strong>
          Indications (cytapheresis)
         </strong>
         – Therapeutic cytapheresis (ie, removal of white blood cells, platelets, or red blood cells) can be performed to reduce excessive numbers of cells or pathologically abnormal cells; this may be used for hyperleukocytosis, marked thrombocytosis, or red blood cell exchange transfusion. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Common uses of therapeutic cytapheresis'

         <strong>
          ASFA categories
         </strong>
         – The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) guidelines for TA are based on literature reviews of multiple disease states. Conditions are assigned to one of four categories based on evidence of clinical efficacy  (

          table 2

         ). (See

         <strong>
          Venous access
         </strong>
         – Successful TA requires reliable vascular access with either two large, durable peripheral veins or a central dual lumen catheter that is rigid enough to withstand significant flow pressures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Venous access'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Choice of replacement fluid
         </strong>
         – The intravascular volume removed by TA must be replaced to prevent marked volume depletion. Albumin, normal
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         , or a combination of albumin and normal saline are the replacement fluids of choice for most conditions. Plasma is appropriate in some conditions that require replacement of a plasma protein or substance with low or absent levels (eg, ADAMTS13 in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP]). For most conditions, it should be adequate to perform 1 to 1.5 plasma volume exchanges per procedure. A single plasma volume exchange in an average-sized adult uses approximately 3 liters of replacement fluid. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Replacement fluids'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Frequency
         </strong>
         – The apheresis schedule should be determined by the patient's condition, the pathologic substance targeted for removal, and the desired clinical and/or laboratory endpoint. Only one or two procedures may be required to rapidly reduce IgM levels; a more rigorous regimen involving several apheresis procedures may be warranted to significantly reduce IgG levels. Adjunctive use of immunosuppressive therapy may be required, depending on the patient's diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Apheresis schedule'
         </a>

          Complications
         </strong>
         – Complications of TA are discussed separately, including hypocalcemia; depletion of coagulation factors, immunoglobulins, or medications; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-related symptoms; and adverse reactions to donor plasma such as anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and exposure to infectious pathogens.
