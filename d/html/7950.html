Obtaining a medical and behavioral history from prospective blood donors is one of the first steps in this process.</p><p>This topic reviews the blood donor medical history. Other protections are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Protections for the donor</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7949.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Overview of recipient and donor protections", section on 'Pre-donation procedures and processes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7949.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Overview of recipient and donor protections", section on 'Protection of the donor'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory testing of donated blood</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the US Food and Drug Administration revised some restrictions on donor eligibility to increase the donor pool and address concerns about blood shortages, while still maintaining a very high degree of safety for transfusion recipients. (See <a class="local">'Revised donor criteria to improve the blood supply during the pandemic'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17575240"><span class="h2">Role of the medical history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The medical history consists of basic information about risk factors for transfusion-transmitted infections and donor medical conditions. A combination of educational materials and specific questions are intended to help donors provide the most accurate and complete medical history. </p><p>Appropriate donor screening also avoids costs and burdens of collecting blood that is subsequently discarded due to infectious risk. </p><p>Donor history questions encompass the following domains:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infectious organisms that are also screened by laboratory testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing", section on 'Infectious disease screening and surveillance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infectious organisms for which donated blood is not tested, such as malaria, other parasitic diseases, and prion disorders. (See <a class="local">'Parasitic diseases'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prion disorders'</a> below and <a class="local">'Neurodegenerative and other neurologic disorders'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medications with teratogenic potential.

(See <a class="local">'Age cutoff and medical conditions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Information obtained from the donor history questionnaire determines whether the donor is eligible to give blood or whether the donor is deferred from donating on that day. Deferrals may either be temporary (for a defined time interval, usually 3 or 12 months), permanent, or indefinite; indefinite deferral does not have a time limit but is permanent unless donor eligibility criteria were to change in the future.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Development of donor history questions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All blood donors are required to answer medical history questions. These questions have evolved over time related to changes in infectious risks and to extend the blood supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. (See <a class="local">'COVID-19 pandemic considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HIV</strong> – In the early 1980s, with the recognition of possible transfusion-transmitted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, additional donor questions concerning HIV risk factors were added to the medical history. In ensuing years, these questions evolved to include evaluation of high risk sexual activity, injection drug history, and history of sexually transmitted diseases. (See <a class="local">'HIV'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Donated blood is tested for anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA), as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing", section on 'HIV-1 and HIV-2'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific types of prion disorders</strong> – Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD, a prion disorder) was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1996, and subsequent evidence suggested that transmission could occur via transfusion. Deferral criteria related to residence in Europe (or specific European countries) or other potential exposures were put into place but were discontinued after publication of an FDA guidance document in 2022. (See <a class="local">'Prion disorders'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malaria</strong> – In the United States, there is no laboratory testing of donated blood for malaria; the donor history is the only means of identifying malaria risk factors. Donor history questions regarding a history of malaria or risk factors for malaria (residence in or travel to malaria-endemic areas) were added in the mid-1990s. The time after returning from travel to a malaria-endemic area had been one year after departure from the area but was subsequently shortened to three months during the COVID-19 pandemic. (See <a class="local">'Malaria'</a> below and <a class="local">'Revised donor criteria to improve the blood supply during the pandemic'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Babesiosis</strong> – Questions regarding a history of babesiosis (infection with <em>Babesia</em> species) were added in the 2000s. (See <a class="local">'Babesiosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Zika virus</strong> – Zika virus transmission from transfusion was reported during the 2015 to 2016 outbreak in the Americas, leading to addition of donor history questions related to Zika virus exposure. These questions were eliminated after laboratory testing was instituted; testing was removed after the outbreak waned. (See <a class="local">'Zika virus'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p>In the United States, medical history questions concerning specific risk factors for infectious diseases need to meet deferral criteria established by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In other countries, questions will be dictated by the appropriate regulatory authority [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In the United States, variation is permitted in the exact wording of questions or in the format of interviewing blood donors. Each blood collection center's medical history standard operating procedure (SOP) must be approved by the FDA. The FDA maintains an online list of their guidances for industry related to blood collection, blood processing, and blood transfusion (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fvaccines-blood-biologics%2Fbiologics-guidances%2Fblood-guidances&amp;token=8RYIFfyLhIBYEqeX7m6uPCAYXbe6hMWqSMY3QTohzRwZCmgAiBa4hxJwxpoyjTyxnimfGt%2BvkGUXKN1eIWiRtwoMcMNtpzfIC1tCBu7pBTY%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7950" target="_blank">blood guidances</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, an interagency task force under the auspices of the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) developed and standardized a uniform set of donor questions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef135068" href="/d/graphic/135068.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and validated these through cognitively-based research protocols [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]. This initial Uniform Donor History Questionnaire (UDHQ) and its subsequent revisions have been approved by the FDA and, though not required, are used by most blood centers [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. It can be administered orally or can be self-administered, with follow-up questioning by a health historian if the donor's responses raise questions about donor eligibility. </p><p>Many blood centers have implemented a computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI) process that includes audio, pictorial (visual), and touch-screen components. A two-year evaluation at one blood center showed that identification of high-risk behaviors among prospective first-time donors significantly increased following the use of CASI when compared with results obtained from the previously administered oral questionnaire [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Historically it was required that the questionnaire be administered on the day of donation at the blood donation facility. Some blood centers have moved to offering the option of answering medical history questions through an online portal on the day of donation, prior to the donor arriving at the blood collection facility.</p><p>Because many questions in the medical history refer to events in the remote past, the FDA also approved an abbreviated donor history questionnaire (aDHQ) designed to identify recent changes in medical, behavior, and travel information that have occurred since a donor's previous donation [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The aDHQ eliminates questions about events or behaviors that, if a donor had previously answered "no" on the UDHQ, would not need to be asked in future interviews of that donor. To be eligible to receive the aDHQ, the donor has to donate at an acceptable frequency, and the blood collection agency needs to have a policy permitting use of this instrument.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15491361"><span class="h2">Accuracy of donor responses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To maximize the accuracy of response, staff at the donation site should be encouraged to use appropriate nonjudgmental language, avoid culturally stigmatized terms, and refrain from behaviors that may be perceived as pressuring the donor. The value of donor history questions depends on the willingness of potential donors to reveal high-risk behaviors for infectious diseases and provide accurate information about their behaviors, general health, risk factors for infectious diseases, and medications. </p><p>The accuracy of donor responses to medical history questionnaires has been evaluated in the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General donor pool</strong> – Two retrospective studies from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) published in 1993 and 1998 used anonymous post-donation surveys mailed to individuals who had donated blood within the previous four to eight weeks (together totaling approximately 100,000 donors) and compared results with information provided at the time of donation [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The survey asked questions related to demographic information, donation history, and history of HIV risk factors. Among respondents, approximately 2 to 3 percent reported behaviors that would have resulted in deferral had they been disclosed at the time of donation. A third post-donation survey study conducted by REDS in 2013 (at a time when men who have sex with men [MSM] sexual activity required a permanent deferral from donation) showed results consistent with these prior studies, in that 2.6 percent of male blood donors admitted to MSM sexual activity that they had not reported at the time of donation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HIV and HCV seropositive donors</strong> – Various interview studies have documented that individuals seropositive for HIV or hepatitis viruses do not always disclose their risk factors at the time of donation, nor do they use the post-donation confidential call-back mechanism to disclose these risk factors [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. Reasons for proceeding with the donation included failure to read or fully comprehend the information in the donation material, pressure to donate, a desire to be tested for HIV, and the impression that laboratory screening would identify infected blood and lead to its removal. Some individuals did not consider certain high-risk behaviors to be high risk because they were infrequent, were not recent, or had subsequently been modified. </p><p></p><p>These and other studies illustrate that a low level of increased risk continues to occur for certain transfusion-transmitted infections and that this risk is not identified by donor questioning. Continued efforts to improve the sensitivity of behavioral screening appear to be warranted [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]; laboratory testing remains critical. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2758387249"><span class="h1">COVID-19 PANDEMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2313739692"><span class="h2">Donation following COVID-19 vaccination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals who have been vaccinated for COVID-19 can donate blood or blood components [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Those who have received a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine or other non-infectious vaccine (nonreplicating, inactivated) can donate immediately.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine were to be developed, it is likely that donor deferral would be 14 days.

(See <a class="local">'General symptoms of active infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Donors are encouraged to contact the blood center if they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or are diagnosed with COVID-19 in a defined period after donation (this ranges from 48 hours to 14 days depending on the blood center). Units from these individuals are removed from inventory.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1678617410"><span class="h2">Revised donor criteria to improve the blood supply during the pandemic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the summer of 2020, many United States blood collection agencies responded to the difficulty in obtaining blood donations during the pandemic by establishing programs to test all blood donors for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, both as an incentive to attract more blood donors as well as a method to identify antibody-positive donors who might be candidates to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma (assuming an adequate antibody level or titer) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. This antibody testing was phased out in the spring and summer of 2021.</p><p>In April 2020, the FDA altered donor deferral criteria as a means of increasing the pool of available donors and maintaining the blood supply [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>The revisions are related to three potential infectious risks:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HIV</strong> – Deferral for men who have sex with men (MSM) and individuals with most other HIV risk factors, including commercial sex workers and injection drug use, were shortened to three months [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Subsequently (in May 2023), the FDA recommended that the MSM deferral be removed and replaced by an approach termed individual risk-based questioning, in which all donors are asked the same sexual risk-based questions regardless of their sex or gender identity [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See <a class="local">'HIV'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malaria</strong> – Deferral after return from travel to a malaria-endemic area was shortened from 12 months to three months [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Use of a pathogen inactivation technology (available for platelets and plasma but not for whole blood or red blood cell units) is an alternative to donor deferral for travelers. The three-year deferral for individuals who have resided in a malaria-endemic country or who have recovered from malaria remains in place. (See <a class="local">'Malaria'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prion diseases</strong> – Several deferrals related to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD (vCJD) were revised; they were further revised in 2022 [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>].

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/15874.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Blood donation (giving blood) (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/682.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21040292"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Importance of the medical history interview</strong> – The major procedure for screening donors at the donation site is the medical history interview, which contains questions to reduce the risks of transfusion-transmitted infection and adverse reactions to donation. These questions are continually reviewed and updated as new risks arise. (See <a class="local">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>COVID-19</strong> – Individuals who have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and/or vaccination for COVID-19 can donate, as long as 10 days have passed from the resolution of symptoms or a positive test. Deferral is not required after receipt of available mRNA or adenoviral vectored vaccines. The pandemic resulted in modifications to some donor deferrals to increase the blood supply while maintaining a high degree of safety. (See <a class="local">'COVID-19 pandemic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific questions</strong> – The following blood donor medical history criteria are used to protect the recipient from transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases and other risks:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute infections</strong> – Blood is not collected from persons who are febrile at the time of donation, who state that they do not feel well, or who are taking systemic antibiotics. (See <a class="local">'General symptoms of active infection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Recent vaccination, antibiotic or antiviral medications, or biologic product'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>HIV</strong> – Donors are asked about sexual activities, injection drug use, prior HIV testing, and history of syphilis or gonorrhea. Individuals who have ever tested positive for HIV or been treated for HIV are permanently deferred. In May of 2023, screening questions based on a gender-neutral individual risk assessment were recommended to replace questions about men who have sex with men (MSM). (See <a class="local">'HIV'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other viral and parasitic diseases</strong> – Donors are asked questions about risk for hepatitis and other viral infections, parasitic diseases (malaria, babesiosis), and prion disorders such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Travel-related questions are relevant to potential exposure to malaria. (See <a class="local">'Hepatitis B and C viruses'</a> above and <a class="local">'Parasitic diseases'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prion disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Medical conditions</strong> – In most blood centers, a donor with a history of a solid organ cancer will be eligible to donate only if they have been symptom-free and considered to be clinically cured for a defined time period. Donors with a history of hematologic malignancy are permanently deferred. (See <a class="local">'History of cancer'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For their own protection, individuals are deferred from donating if they have certain types of heart or lung disease, have undergone recent surgery, have a neurodegenerative disorder that interferes with their ability to tolerate donation, or are pregnant. Individuals with a seizure disorder are able to donate provided they have been seizure-free for a specified period of time. The minimal age for donation is typically 16 to 17 years, depending on state laws. Most blood centers do not impose an upper age limit for donation. (See <a class="local">'Age cutoff and medical conditions'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7949.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Overview of recipient and donor protections", section on 'Protection of the donor'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Medications</strong> – Some drugs may pose a risk due to their teratogenic potential or effects on hemostatic function. (See <a class="local">'Medications taken by the donor'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Deferrals for potentially teratogenic medications are listed above. (See <a class="local">'Potential teratogens'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Donors who have received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8520" href="/d/drug information/8520.html" rel="external">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG) are deferred for one year, as are donors who received an experimental or an unlicensed vaccine, unless otherwise indicated by the blood collection facility medical director. (See <a class="local">'Prion disorders'</a> above and <a class="local">'Recent vaccination, antibiotic or antiviral medications, or biologic product'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Apheresis platelet donors are deferred if they have recently taken an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant.
