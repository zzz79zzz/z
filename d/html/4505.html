It was classified as AML-M3 in the older French-American-British (FAB) classification system, and acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1);PML-RARA in the World Health Organization classification system. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86098.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Classification"</a>.)</p><p>The vast majority of patients with newly diagnosed APL obtain a hematologic complete remission (CR) with induction therapy that incorporates <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9262" href="/z/d/drug information/9262.html" rel="external">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA; tretinoin), followed by a molecular CR after consolidation therapy. Using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8977" href="/z/d/drug information/8977.html" rel="external">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO) during consolidation of first CR markedly reduced the relapse rate even in high-risk APL. The current standard of care for the treatment of newly diagnosed APL is the chemotherapy-free combination of ATRA plus ATO, and relapses are quite uncommon after molecular remissions. The predominant cause of induction failure (5 to 10 percent) is death from hemorrhage or infection, and it is extremely uncommon to have primary drug resistance in APL. However, for patients treated with ATRA plus anthracycline chemotherapy, relapse occurs in 5 to 10 percent of patients with APL and in 20 to 30 percent of those with high-risk APL (ie, presentation with a white blood cell count &gt;10,000/microL and a platelet count &lt;40,000/microL). Some of these relapses have occurred after more than five years in remission. </p><p>The treatment of relapsed or refractory APL will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and prognosis of APL in adults are presented separately, as is the initial treatment of APL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4527.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4498.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Resistant or refractory APL is diagnosed in those patients who either fail to attain a cytologic complete remission with induction chemotherapy or fail to attain a complete molecular remission following several cycles of consolidation chemotherapy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Response criteria are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4525.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Induction therapy in medically fit adults", section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>We consider patients to have relapsed disease if, after attainment of complete molecular remission, subsequent analyses confirm the loss of such molecular remission or identify extramedullary disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment of patients with relapsed APL is generally aimed at achieving molecular remission with plans to proceed to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in those with chemotherapy-sensitive disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Allogeneic HCT can be considered if a suitable donor is available, but for APL, allogeneic HCT is not clearly better than autologous HCT, at least in patients who achieve a second complete molecular response. For patients who do not achieve RT-PCR negativity, allogeneic HCT is the preferred treatment in eligible patients with an available donor. The treatment of patients who are not candidates for HCT, who fail to respond to second-line regimens, or who relapse after HCT is generally palliative; enrollment onto a clinical trial should be encouraged. The same approach is followed in patients with refractory disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105092208"><span class="h1">ACHIEVING A SECOND RESPONSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several treatment regimens have been used to treat refractory and relapsed disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9262" href="/z/d/drug information/9262.html" rel="external">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA), anthracyclines, high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/z/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">cytarabine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8977" href="/z/d/drug information/8977.html" rel="external">arsenic trioxide</a> (ATO), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8968" href="/z/d/drug information/8968.html" rel="external">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a>. The choice of therapy and the likelihood of cure depend in part upon whether ATRA was given together with an anthracycline drug during the first remission, whether ATO was incorporated into induction or post-remission therapy, and whether the relapse occurred while the patient was still receiving therapy.</p><p>Long-term follow-up of 380 patients initially treated with ATRA demonstrated that most relapses occur during the first three years [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Late relapses are not common, accounting for less than 5 percent of relapses, and are likely to have durable responses with second line therapy.</p><p>The molecular pathways involved in relapsed or refractory APL are poorly understood, but likely differ depending upon the type of initial treatment and the timing of relapse in relation to treatment. As an example, in an analysis of 45 patients with relapsed APL following initial treatment with ATRA plus chemotherapy, 18 cases (40 percent) demonstrated point mutations in the ligand binding domain of PML-RARalpha [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Patients with <em>PML-RARA</em> point mutations had progressive disease while receiving ATRA therapy (11 cases) or progressed following the completion of ATRA therapy (seven cases), suggesting selection pressure due to both ATRA therapy and ATRA-independent mechanisms of progression. In contrast, patients within the same study who received ATO as part of their initial therapy had a lower rate of progression, perhaps due to elimination of clones containing <em>PML-RARA</em> point mutations. Another study of patients with relapse after ATO identified point mutations within the B2 domain of <em>PML</em> that interacts with ATO upon binding [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Some patients with <em>RARA</em> mutations alone responded to subsequent therapy with ATRA plus ATO, while none with both <em>PML</em> and <em>RARA</em> mutations responded.</p><p>A European registry reported outcomes of 155 patients who were treated with ATO for first relapse of APL [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Responses varied with the type of relapse:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematological relapse (104 patients): 91 percent achieved hematological complete remission (CR), 74 percent molecular (m)CR, 27 percent had differentiation syndrome, 7 percent induction death, 2 percent treatment resistance, 68 percent three-year overall survival (OS), 41 percent second relapse </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Molecular relapse (40 patients): 62 percent achieved mCR, no deaths or side effects of ATO, 66 percent three-year OS, 48 percent second relapse </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extramedullary relapse (11 patients): 100 percent hematological CR and mCR, 90 percent three-year OS, 11 percent second relapse </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multivariate analysis reported the following were associated with favorable OS and leukemia-free survival: first CR duration ≥1.5 years, achievement of mCR, autologous or allogeneic HCT in second remission</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Arsenic trioxide (ATO)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H680254656"><span class="h3">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In many areas of the world, ATO is available for frontline treatment of APL. It is also the treatment of choice for most patients with relapsed APL following initial therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy. Complete remission (CR) can be obtained in 85 to 88 percent of patients. It is unclear whether adding ATRA to ATO is better than ATO alone. ATO is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and so can be used in patients with central nervous system involvement [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This therapy is then followed by consolidation treatment, which is selected based upon the depth of response and patient characteristics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a second remission is obtained and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is negative for the <em>PML/RARA </em>transcript, consolidation with either autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), allogeneic HCT, or further ATO is given. Autologous HCT is usually preferred because of its association with less toxicity and morbidity. However, if the patient is young (eg, &lt;30 years of age) and without comorbid conditions, allogeneic HCT is an equally effective choice with a potential, yet unproven improvement in disease control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If PCR negativity is not obtained, allogeneic HCT is the favored treatment, but alternative treatments such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8968" href="/z/d/drug information/8968.html" rel="external">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> are acceptable options.</p><p></p><p>A number of studies have shown a high response rate following therapy with ATO in patients with relapsed APL [<a href="#rid9">9-15</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A case series included 26 patients with relapsed APL who received induction therapy with ATO (0.06 to 0.2 mg/kg per day) [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. CR was achieved in 88 percent at a median time of 47 days. A rising white blood cell count (WBC) &gt;10,000/microL was noted during ATO treatment in 15 patients, with the WBC &gt;100,000/microL in three. Eight patients (31 percent) developed "differentiation syndrome" (a cytokine release mediated phenomenon) at a mean time of 17 days (range 7 to 24 days), and required treatment with corticosteroids. This syndrome was only noted during induction therapy with ATO; neither leukocytosis nor the differentiation syndrome was seen during any postremission courses. Three patients remained positive for the <em>PML/RARA</em> transcript and relapsed early [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a larger series, 47 patients with relapsed APL (43 in first relapse and two each in second and third relapse) received ATO with or without other agents; 31 with ATO alone, 11 with ATO and moderate chemotherapy, and 5 with ATO and ATRA [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. CR was obtained in 85 percent, with median disease-free and overall survival rates of 17 and 25 months, respectively. More than two-thirds of the patients treated with ATO alone or chemotherapy alone after attaining CR subsequently relapsed, as compared with only 2 of 11 patients treated with ATO and chemotherapy after attaining CR. Most of the side effects (liver, GI, skin, cardiac) were modest and responded to symptomatic treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a multicenter trial of 40 patients with APL in first or second relapse, CR following treatment with ATO was attained in 85 percent, 91 percent of whom had negative post-treatment cytogenetic tests for t(15;17) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Overall and relapse-free survival rates at 18 months were 66 and 56 percent, respectively. Ten patients developed the "APL differentiation syndrome" and were effectively treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>. Prolongation of the QT interval was seen in 63 percent; one patient had an asymptomatic 7-beat run of torsades de pointes. There were two deaths during induction, unrelated to drug treatment.</p><p></p><p>For patients with resistant or relapsed disease, we suggest treatment with one or two cycles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8977" href="/z/d/drug information/8977.html" rel="external">arsenic trioxide</a> 0.15 mg/kg per day IV for 25 consecutive doses (or five doses per week for five weeks), followed by autologous HCT in patients who achieve a CR and are RT-PCR negative. Allogeneic HCT can be considered if a suitable donor is available, but for APL, allogeneic HCT is not clearly better than autologous HCT. For patients who do not achieve RT-PCR negativity, allogeneic HCT is the preferred treatment in eligible patients with an available donor.</p><p>An oral formulation of ATO has been shown to be effective for treating relapsed APL [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Seventy-three patients with APL in first relapse received oral ATO-based reinduction and all achieved CR2, irrespective of previous ATO exposure. All patients received oral ATO-based maintenance in CR2. At a median follow-up of 94 months (range, 9 to 205 months), 43 patients (59 percent) were still in CR2, and 49 (67 percent) had finished the planned two-year CR2 maintenance with ATRA, oral ATO, and ascorbic acid. Reinduction and maintenance treatments were well tolerated. Grade 1 and 2 headache occurred in 20 patients (27 percent). Transaminase elevation occurred in 35 patients (48 percent; grade 3 and 4 in 12 percent). Three patients had self-limiting QTc prolongation. The 10-year leukemia-free survival rate was 57 percent.</p><p>In some areas of the world, oral arsenic (realgar-indigo naturalis formula; RIF) is commercially available [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. It has been shown to be as effective as intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8977" href="/z/d/drug information/8977.html" rel="external">arsenic trioxide</a> for both newly diagnosed APL and those with relapsed disease. Experience in China suggests that it displays a better safety profile, improved quality of life, and lower medical costs for patients. This agent is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p><p>Studies of combination therapy with other agents are ongoing and have mixed preliminary results. As an example, a small randomized study of 20 patients with APL relapsed after initial treatment with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, found no benefit with the addition of ATRA to ATO [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Another small pilot study suggested additional benefit when <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8968" href="/z/d/drug information/8968.html" rel="external">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> was added as consolidation after ATO [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Toxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serious adverse events attributed to treatment with ATO include fluid retention, the "differentiation syndrome" (similar to that seen with retinoic acid), peripheral sensory neuropathy, electrocardiographic abnormalities (eg, QT interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block) and sudden death [<a href="#rid20">20-26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4351.html" rel="external">"Differentiation syndrome associated with treatment of acute leukemia"</a>.)</p><p>In an initial report, all eight patients treated with this agent developed QT prolongation and four developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia requiring treatment with antiarrhythmic agents [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. A lower risk was noted in a much larger series of 99 patients [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Reversible prolongation of the QT interval to &gt;500 msec occurred in 38 patients; the risk was increased in patients with hypokalemia, with one hypokalemic patient developing torsades de pointes. Hyperglycemia has also been noted.</p><p>Labeling instructions for this agent recommend that, during therapy, serum potassium concentrations should be kept &gt;4.0 meq/L and magnesium concentrations &gt;1.8 mg/dL [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Maintaining an adequate hemoglobin level and oxygenation may also be important to reduce cardiac toxicity. ATO should be held if the absolute QT interval exceeds 500 msec or if the patient develops syncope or an irregular heartbeat. ATO can be reinstated if these symptoms resolve and the absolute QT interval decreases to 460 msec or below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1043.html" rel="external">"Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, pathophysiology, and causes"</a>.)</p><p>Approximately half of patients will develop a leukocytosis that peaks at approximately day 20 and usually resolves at a median of 10.5 days after the peak, despite continuation of ATO therapy [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>ATO is eliminated mainly by renal excretion. Accordingly, uremic patients are considered unsuitable for treatment with this agent. However, one patient with relapsed APL and chronic renal failure, who was receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, has been successfully treated with ATO, although at a reduced dose [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Gemtuzumab</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8968" href="/z/d/drug information/8968.html" rel="external">Gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> (GO) is an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated with the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin. The CD33 antigen is strongly expressed on APL cells. Clinical trials are evaluating its benefit in combination with ATRA and/or ATO for newly diagnosed patients with APL. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved GO based on multiple trials in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4527.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults", section on 'Immunophenotype'</a>.)</p><p>Case reports and small case series have reported on the successful use of single agent GO in the treatment of patients with relapsed APL [<a href="#rid30">30-33</a>]. As an example, in one study, 14 of 16 patients with APL in molecular relapse responded to treatment with GO (6 mg/m2 by IV infusion over two hours) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Of the 13 patients receiving three doses of this agent, all attained a new molecular remission. In addition, GO has demonstrated activity when administered in combination with ATRA and ATO in patients with relapsed APL [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Chemotherapy and ATRA for relapse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who have received ATRA plus anthracycline treatment during first remission are less likely to be cured by reinstitution of the same treatment at the time of relapse, although a second remission can often be achieved [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The best outcomes in these patients are likely to follow HCT, either at the time of relapse or, preferably, soon after a second CR has been obtained.</p><p>In one study, 35 patients treated after first relapse or primary induction failure received one course of chemotherapy combining an anthracycline and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/z/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">cytarabine</a> with or without ATRA [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. CR was achieved in 29 of 38 patients. Four of five patients who had initially received ATRA achieved a second CR when retreated with ATRA. The only factor predictive of poor prognosis for overall survival was the absence of ATRA therapy at the time of relapse.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105092196"><span class="h1">CONSOLIDATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory APL is generally aimed at achieving a second molecular complete remission (CR) with plans to proceed to high dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in those with chemotherapy-sensitive disease. Allogeneic HCT can be considered if a suitable donor is available, but for APL, allogeneic HCT is not clearly better than autologous HCT. For patients who do not achieve reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity, allogeneic HCT is the preferred treatment in eligible patients with an available donor.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Autologous transplantation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies of autologous HCT performed in second remission suggest that there is prognostic relevance to pretransplant minimal disease assessment by RT-PCR.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one study, all seven PCR-positive patients relapsed at a median time of five months following HCT and nine months from the time of second CR. Of the eight PCR-negative patients, one relapsed at 10 months following HCT, one died of a secondary leukemia, and six remained in hematologic and molecular CR at a median time of 28 months [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A second, larger study evaluated results in 50 patients with APL who received autologous HCT while in second CR [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Treatment-related mortality was 6 percent. For patients in molecular remission at the time of stem cell collection, the seven-year relapse-free survival was 87 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A third study of autologous HCT in 51 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia in second CR included 12 patients (24 percent) with APL [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

Autologous HCT was performed in 23 patients who attained PCR negativity. There were no transplant-related deaths and three patients relapsed after HCT. At a median follow-up of five years, the estimated event-free and overall survival rates at five years were 65 and 77 percent, respectively, for the entire cohort.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective survey reported 207 patients with APL in second CR who received ATO alone for post-remission therapy (67 patients) versus autologous HCT (140 patients) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Compared with ATO-only, five-year overall survival was superior with autologous HCT (78 versus 42 percent). Improved overall survival was also associated with longer duration of first CR, but not with disease risk status at diagnosis. These data suggest that autologous HCT for APL patients in second CR results in better overall survival than ATO-based therapy alone.</p><p></p><p>These studies support the use of autologous HCT in patients who achieve a second molecular CR and discourage its use in those who do not.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Allogeneic transplantation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allogeneic HCT is capable of producing long-term remissions in patients with APL who have achieved a second CR. In an EBMT survey of 137 such patients, five-year leukemia-free survival was 59 percent [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>However, high rates of non-relapse mortality have been a problem, the rates of which vary depending on risk factors such as age and comorbid conditions. In one series, treatment-related mortality was 39 percent [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], while non-relapse mortality was 32 percent in another [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. In contrast to the results with autologous HCT, molecular CR at the time of allogeneic HCT may be less important.
