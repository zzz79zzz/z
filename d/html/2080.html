         Sulfonamide-containing antibiotics are the second most frequent cause of allergic drug reactions, after the beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins). In one large study, the incidence of reactions to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9785" href="/z/d/drug information/9785.html" rel="external">
          trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

         (TMP-SMX) was 34 per 1000 patients exposed, compared with 51 per 1000 for

         [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ]. However, the adverse reactions caused by sulfonamides differ significantly from those attributed to beta-lactams, and the evaluation and management of sulfonamide reactions are distinct. The pathophysiology of allergic (or hypersensitivity) reactions to sulfonamides is complex and poorly understood.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review describes the most prevalent types of reactions to sulfonamides, the evaluation of patients with reported allergy, and cross-reactivity issues. Management options for patients with past reactions who require similar medications again are also presented. Most of the available literature concerns allergic reactions to antimicrobial sulfonamides, particularly TMP-SMX. However, reactions to nonantimicrobial sulfonamides (eg, diuretics, sulfonylureas, and others) and sulfones (eg,

         The imprecise term "sulfa drugs" is most often applied to sulfonamide antimicrobials, although it is variably used for other medications as well. This term has contributed to ongoing confusion about relevant cross-reactivity among sulfonamide drugs. It is preferable to avoid "sulfa allergy" and instead document the specific medication that caused the adverse reaction and the symptoms that were involved.

         This group includes sulfamethoxazole (in

         ]. The antimicrobial sulfonamides share two essential functional groups: an arylamine (an amine group linked to a benzene ring at N4) and an aromatic (N-containing) 5 or 6 member ring attached to the sulfonamide core as an N1 substituent  (

          figure 1

         ). The presence of both moieties is essential to their mechanism of antimicrobial action (ie, as an analog of para-aminobenzoic acid) and is also believed central to the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4

Thus, sulfasalazine should be avoided in patients with a significant allergy to sulfonamide antimicrobials.

         The most common type of hypersensitivity reaction to sulfonamides is an isolated dermatologic reaction. Signs and symptoms are variable and may include erythema, maculopapular or morbilliform rash, urticaria, and pruritus. Most of these reactions appear within the first three days of therapy and resolve promptly after drug discontinuation [

         A more serious type of sulfonamide hypersensitivity is characterized by a pruritic, maculopapular or morbilliform rash, accompanied or preceded by fever. In some patients, this progresses to multisystem organ involvement and dysfunction. Severity can range from mild to severe to fatal. Sulfonamide antimicrobials (usually

          trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

         [TMP-SMX]) are most commonly implicated in this type of reaction, although nonantimicrobial sulfonamides are occasionally causative.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms generally develop one to two weeks after the start of administration, with fever usually appearing first, sometimes accompanied by malaise and pharyngitis. Peripheral blood smear may reveal an atypical lymphocytosis or eosinophilia [

          2,9
         </a>
         ]. Organ involvement may be asymptomatic or overt and can include hepatitis, nephritis, pulmonary infiltrates, and cytopenias. Symptoms generally resolve one to two weeks after discontinuation. With re-exposure, symptoms may appear within one to two days.

          10

         There is some evidence that these rare reactions involve the substituted aromatic ring, rather than the arylamine portion [
         <a href="#rid13">

        <p>
         For sulfonamides, the relevant drug antigen is usually not the intact drug itself. Instead, reactive metabolites may become bound in large numbers to serum or cell surface carrier proteins and thereby create a multivalent immunologic stimulus, which can differ structurally from the parent drug. Thus, the utility of skin testing with the original (unmetabolized) sulfonamide is unknown.

         SJS is characterized by a prodrome of malaise and fever, followed by the rapid onset of erythematous or purpuric macules and plaques and blistering of the mucous membranes. The skin lesions progress to epidermal necrosis and sloughing. TEN is a similar but more severe disorder that involves a greater percentage of the body surface area.

Patients may display a range of other neurologic and systemic symptoms and signs. In a literature review of 41 cases, most patients developed symptoms to the combination of TMP and SMX, although cases were identified that were triggered by TMP alone or SMX alone [

         Sulfonamide antimicrobials are metabolized along several pathways. Some of the drug becomes acetylated (via N-acetyl transferase) at the arylamine moiety to form nontoxic metabolites that are excreted in the urine. Alternatively, the arylamine group may undergo N-oxidation via cytochrome P450 to form reactive metabolites  (

         <a href="#rid21">
          21,23

         Studies of cross-reactivity among related medications are often confounded by the fact that a clinical history of drug allergy by itself identifies a subgroup of patients who are at increased risk of reactions to medications in general, even in the absence of actual cross-reactivity among the implicated drugs [

          26

         ]. Individuals who had a documented allergic reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic in the past did indeed react more commonly to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic (10 percent) compared with those who tolerated sulfonamide antibiotics (1.6 percent). However, those same individuals with documented sulfonamide antibiotic reactions reacted to the chemically distinct penicillins even more often (14 percent). In addition, there was a higher risk of reaction to sulfonamide nonantibiotics in those with a history of reactions to penicillins than those with a history of reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics.

         This strongly suggests that a predisposition of drug hypersensitivity reactions in general is a better predictor for sulfonamide allergy than a past reaction to a different type of sulfonamide.

         A data synthesis of the cases of suspected cross-reactions, including published reports and manufacturers' data on file from 1966 to 2004, noted that the FDA product information for 17 of 33 nonantimicrobial sulfonamide drugs included varying statements, warnings, or actual contraindication statements against their use in patients with "sulfonamide" allergy [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

Sulfasalazine is a nonantimicrobial that releases sulfapyridine, an antimicrobial, upon exposure to gut bacteria.

Subgroup analysis of those patients did reveal a higher rate of dermatologic reactions compared with the group as a whole. However, the three- to sixfold elevation in rate of reactions was also seen in patients receiving other NSAIDs and placebo, indicating that these patients were at higher risk for hypersensitivity drug reactions in general [

         and an increased incidence of SJS. A large retrospective review of postmarketing safety surveillance reports (from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System) for several of the selective COX-2 inhibitors documented significant increases of reported SJS above baseline rates [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Compared with an expected background rate of 1.9 cases per million annually, calculated rates were 5.7 per million in celecoxib users (based on 19 reported cases in the first two years of marketing). Twenty-one percent of these individuals had also reported "sulfa allergy." Since comparison data from appropriate control groups are not available in studies of this nature, risks of possible cross-reactivity cannot be calculated or directly inferred. Further studies are needed to define the risk of SJS with celecoxib.

          Avoidance

         – Use of an alternative medication of a distinct pharmacologic class is obviously the safest and simplest option in most patients with past sulfonamide reactions. Avoidance is the only safe approach if a patient describes symptoms consistent with any type of blistering dermatitis or diffuse erythroderma. These patients should almost never undergo test dosing or desensitization, except in very unusual circumstances. Case series have noted that Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) can recur and may be more severe with even minor re-exposures [

          Test dosing
         </strong>
         – "Test dosing" (or graded drug challenge) is a term used to describe the cautious administration of small and increasing doses of a medication under medical observation. Test dosing is appropriate for patients who are
         <strong>
          unlikely
         </strong>
         to be allergic to the drug in question. It does not alter the patient's immune response to the drug, so patients who tolerate a graded challenge prove that they are not allergic to that drug.

         The starting dose used is influenced by the severity and remoteness of the past reaction and may range from 1/1000

         to 1/10

         ]. This amount is then gradually increased by 3- to 10-fold at each step. The steps are administered at time intervals that are long enough to allow for the development of symptoms, and these intervals are determined by the nature of the past reaction.

         would be an appropriate candidate for test dosing, as cross-sensitivity between these two nonantimicrobial sulfonamides is unlikely but not impossible. If the patient reports that the rash to hydrochlorothiazide had appeared within two to four hours of the last administered dose, then it would be appropriate to give test doses at intervals of six to eight hours, beginning at 1/10
         <sup>
          th

          Desensitization

         In most patients with fever and nonblistering rash in response to a sulfonamide drug in the past, the use of chemically distinct medication is the most prudent option. However, if there is no equivalent alternative medication and another sulfonamide medication is required, then both test dosing and desensitization may be considered.

         The specific test dose protocol would be based upon the patient's past reaction. If the original reaction involved delayed-onset rash, initial test doses can be repeated for several days without dose escalation in order to ensure that any reactions have sufficient time to develop. As an example, a patient with past hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX who required

         could take one-half of the lowest strength tablet available once daily for a week as an initial test dose.

          Sulfonylurea allergy in diabetes

         ). Sulfonylureas occasionally cause adverse reactions with presumed immunologic mechanisms, most commonly dermatologic reactions, such as urticaria, photosensitive rash, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Sulfonylurea hypoglycemics can be safely given to patients with past reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobials (such as TMP-SMX), although there is little in the published medical literature addressing issues of possible cross-reactivity between sulfonylureas and other types of nonantimicrobial sulfonamides.

         For patients with past reactions consistent with IgE-mediated allergy or anaphylaxis (ie, hives, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and/or hypotension), the causative drug should be avoided.

         The term "desensitization" is used to describe the cautious administration of small and increasing doses of a medication under careful medical observation to patients in whom allergic reactions are considered
         <strong>
          probable

         . Desensitization may be attempted for some types of reactions when there are no medically acceptable alternatives.

        <p>
         The term "desensitization" usually refers to procedures designed to allow patients with a history of type I (IgE-mediated, immediate-type hypersensitivity) drug allergy to
         <strong>
          temporarily
         </strong>
         tolerate readministration of a medication, such as penicillin [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         ]. Patients must continue to take the medication regularly (usually at least daily) following a successful desensitization procedure. Because of the temporary nature of the effect, the term "hyposensitization" is preferred by some allergy experts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Protocols have also been developed for a small number of other medication reactions that result from non-IgE-mediated immunologic mechanisms, including sulfonamide sensitivity involving delayed maculopapular rashes and fever. Unfortunately, these procedures for non-IgE-mediated skin rashes are also called desensitizations, despite the lack of evidence that any immune cell (eg, T lymphocyte) is downregulated as a result of the process. Despite these uncertainties, desensitization is the commonly used term for sulfonamide re-exposure protocols, and this review uses the term as well. These protocols may appear to be successful in large part because many patients lose immunologic sensitivity over time.

         Drug desensitization protocols vary, although all are based upon administering increasing doses of medication in an uninterrupted and stepwise manner, beginning with very low doses. The protocols presented here have been performed successfully by the author, although modifications may be made based on characteristics of the individual case. In most cases, these modifications are made to escalate the dose more slowly. Clinicians should avoid altering successful protocols to render them faster or significantly change the time interval between doses.

         The largest published study of TMP-SMX desensitization in HIV-positive patients involved 48 patients undergoing the protocol outlined in the table  (

         ]. By day 3, subjects were receiving a full (single strength) TMP-SMX tablet, and 77 percent of those undergoing this regimen were able to tolerate the course of therapy for a mean of 16 months without adverse effects. Eleven subjects failed to complete the course of therapy, with eight stopping within the first two days. One patient experienced hypotension and acute nonfatal myocardial infarction. Higher relative and absolute CD4 counts were associated with trends toward higher risk of failure.

         Another study of 22 patients used a longer nine-day protocol, which was successful in 87 percent of patients  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         We initiate all desensitization protocols under medical supervision. For patients with mild fever and/or morbilliform rash in the past, we typically administer the first three doses of this protocol in the clinic and then allow the patient to complete the remaining steps as an outpatient. The three-day protocol is sufficiently short, and it can be administered entirely in the clinic under medical supervision. This may be preferred, for example, if the patient's ability to follow a timed schedule of doses is uncertain. In contrast, the longer nine-day protocol may be better for reliable patients in whom the main concern is introducing the medication very gradually, as the success rate of this protocol was high.

         Any symptoms that develop during desensitization must be promptly evaluated in the clinic. If a patient develops mild morbilliform rash during desensitization without fever, systemic symptoms, or mucosal involvement, then we typically reduce the dose to the last tolerated step and administer this dose repeatedly at the usual time intervals, while simultaneously treating the rash. We treat mild rashes with antihistamines and more extensive rashes with oral glucocorticoids. When the rash begins to improve, the doses can be escalated again, although we sometimes increase the doses more gradually.

         We typically abort the desensitization protocol if fever or systemic symptoms develop.

This includes dermatologic reactions, such as urticaria/angioedema or other types of rash, pulmonary reactions, such as asthma, and rare multisystem anaphylaxis. Other types of serious and life-threatening reactions have also been reported in association with these procedures, including myocardial infarction [

         Desensitization may be effective only as long as the allergic individual is continuously exposed to the drug. After completing a desensitization protocol for an IgE-mediated drug reaction, the patient must continue the course of treatment without missing a single daily dose [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. Whether the same is true for patients desensitized to TMP-SMX, however, is speculative. Patients should be counseled that they may have a recurrent reaction if they forget to take their daily dose on one or more consecutive days.

         There are two distinct groups of sulfonamides: antimicrobial sulfonamides and nonantimicrobial sulfonamides  (

         ). Antimicrobial sulfonamides contain an arylamine group that undergoes metabolic changes believed critical to the development of hypersensitivity reactions. Medications in the nonantimicrobial group do not contain arylamine groups and are associated only rarely with hypersensitivity reactions.

         Hypersensitivity reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobials most commonly present as fever and morbilliform rash, sometimes accompanied by organ involvement, beginning one to two weeks after the start of therapy. (See

         Sulfonamides less commonly cause other types of immunologic drug reactions, including serum sickness-like reactions and immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated allergic reactions. Sulfonamide antimicrobials are highly associated with the rare blistering reactions Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). (See
