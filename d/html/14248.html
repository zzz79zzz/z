         For some patients with chronic pain who do not obtain satisfactory analgesia with conventional first line approaches, interventional therapy may provide a safe and effective option. Interventional therapy refers to a group of invasive analgesic techniques including injections, ablations, infusion therapies, neuromodulation, and some minimally invasive surgical techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss some of the most commonly used interventional procedures, including contraindications, description of the procedure itself, and, if noted, potential complications. Where indicated below, the indications for procedures and the role in therapy for specific conditions is discussed in separate UpToDate topics on those conditions.

         Patients with coagulopathy, who are taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or with severe thrombocytopenia, may be at increased risk of bleeding with interventional procedures. The degree of risk and the potential consequences if bleeding occurs vary depending on the site of the procedure and the ability to identify and compress bleeding. Decisions regarding holding anticoagulants and/or performing interventional procedures in patients with thrombocytopenia should be made on an individual basis. For patients taking anticoagulants, there should be a risk/benefit analysis that includes the reason the patient is taking the anticoagulant. These decisions may require collaboration among the interventionalist, the referring clinician, and the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain medicine societies have created guidelines that assign a level of bleeding risk to various interventional procedures, and have made recommendations on the timing of procedures relative to doses of medications that affect coagulation, to minimize the risk of bleeding  (

         Epidural glucocorticoid injections (also known as epidural steroid injections [ESI]) are used to treat back pain that may be refractory to conservative management. The most common condition treated is radicular pain, however this procedure may be used for spinal stenosis with or without neurogenic claudication, and chronic low back pain. Indications for these injections and evidence of efficacy are discussed separately. (See

         The procedure is typically performed prone, with fluoroscopy, and with local anesthesia. The use of sedation varies among institutions, ranging from no sedation to deep sedation, and may include the use of monitored anesthesia care. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">
          "Monitored anesthesia care in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Epidural glucocorticoid injection is performed by injecting the drug through a needle tip placed in the epidural space, between the dura and the ligamentum flavum  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111959" href="/z/d/graphic/111959.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The needle can be inserted via a translaminar approach (through the interlaminar space in the spine), the transforaminal approach (more lateral through the neuroforamen dorsal to the nerve root), or the caudal approach (from the sacrum just above the coccyx through the sacral hiatus and sacral canal)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64964" href="/z/d/graphic/64964.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). A catheter may be used in the interlaminar or the caudal approach if needed to obtain optimal spread of the injected solution to the desired location. If fluoroscopy is used, contrast dye is usually injected to confirm placement of the needle and injectate in the epidural space.
        </p>
        <p>
         The injected solution contains glucocorticoid with or without local anesthetic. We inform patients that they may not appreciate benefits from the epidural glucocorticoid injection for 24 to 72 hours or even later, whether or not local anesthetic is used. This varies greatly as some patients feel relatively immediate relief (particularly if local anesthetic is used) and others may not feel substantial benefits until days or weeks later. This variation may be because the injected glucocorticoid has both direct effects in the spine and also systemic effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an outpatient/ambulatory procedure, the patient can usually go home after a brief period of post-procedure observation. We follow up at approximately four weeks. If there is no benefit at this time, we consider alternative treatments and approaches. If there is an incremental benefit we may repeat the procedure based on the patient tolerance for exposure to additional glucocorticoid. If the patient has complete or near complete relief, we typically will observe and re-evaluate if pain returns. In most well selected patients, pain relief lasts for at least two months.

         There are potential adverse effects from systemic absorption of the glucocorticoid, including elevated blood glucose, hypertension, and mood changes. Frequent injections and higher doses of glucocorticoids can cause decreased bone density. At our institution, we use

         10 mg per injection, with a frequency of not more than every six weeks to three months and a maximum of four injections over 12 months. At these doses and intervals, the risk of decreased bone density is low. (See

         These vertebral augmentation procedures are used to treat vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis, metastatic bone disease, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.

Medial branch blocks may be used to help diagnose pain from facet joints (zygapophyseal joints), and as a predictive test in anticipation of potential radiofrequency ablation of the medial branch nerves that innervate the facet joints. Medial branch blocks may be performed for suspected cervical or lumbar facet joint related pain. They have also been used for pain from vertebral compression fracture [

          Procedure
         </strong>
         – Medial branch block is typically performed prone, with fluoroscopy, and with local anesthesia. The use of sedation varies among institutions, ranging from no sedation to deep sedation, and may include the use of monitored anesthesia care (see

          "Monitored anesthesia care in adults"
         </a>
         ). This is an outpatient procedure and the patient can typically be discharged after a very brief period of observation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Under fluoroscopic guidance, local anesthetic is injected at the junction of the superior articular process and the transverse process.

        <p>
        </p>

         Post-procedure pain is usually mild and manageable with over-the-counter analgesics and icing.

         A successful block would result in at least 80 percent improvement in pain. Many insurance policies, including Medicare in many regions, require two successful medial branch blocks on different days in order to cover radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN), the definitive procedure. Once MBB is complete, the patient can then be brought back as soon as the next day for the RFN. (See

         Intra-articular facet (IAF) joint injection may be performed for patients who are strongly suspected of having facet related spinal pain, particularly for those who may be too young for, or otherwise unable or unwilling to undergo, RFN of medial branches. Ablation of the medial branches destroys the nerves, but they usually grow back over time, and may grow back faster in healthy young individuals, such that they would need more years of repeat RFN if necessary than older patients. In individuals less than 40 to 50 years of age, an IAF injection may be tried instead. IAF injections may be diagnostic (confirming facet joint pain) with local anesthetic (LA) injection, or therapeutic with glucocorticoid injection with or without LA, and can help determine whether to consider RFN. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Radiofrequency neurotomy (radiofrequency ablation)'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         IAF injections may be performed in the lumbar, cervical, or thoracic regions, however, risks are higher with cervical and thoracic injections [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         ] and they are much more rarely performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnostic blocks are performed more than once, typically using local anesthetics with different duration of action, to minimize the risk of false positive results. A successful block provides at least 50 percent pain relief for the duration of the local anesthetic.

         Blockade of the sympathetic nervous system may be considered when pain is potentially mediated or amplified by aberrant sympathetic activity, thought to be related to shared pathways between nerves carrying pain signal and autonomic fibers. Symptoms may be diffused and seem out of proportion to pain expected based on normal somatic anatomy (eg, usual dermatomal pattern or distribution). (See

         Sympathetic axons exit their nuclei in the spinal cord at the T1 to L2 or L3 levels and continue to form paravertebral or prevertebral ganglia. Paravertebral ganglia comprise the sympathetic trunk along the vertebral column, and join at the level of the coccyx to create the ganglion impar. Prevertebral ganglia exist in the preaortic celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric plexuses. Both efferent sympathetic fibers and afferents from internal organs traverse the sympathetic ganglia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the cervical and lumbar regions, sympathetic ganglia and plexuses are separate from somatic nerves, such that sympathetic blocks can achieve analgesia without somatic sensory block. This is not true in the thoracic region, where injecting near the paravertebral chain is less common and has heightened risks due to proximity of somatic nerves, neuraxial structures, and the pleura.

         Sympathetic blocks are contraindicated in patients with infection at the injection site or systemic infection. These blocks are considered intermediate risk blocks due to concerns of bleeding. Thus, the risk of bleeding should be balanced against the potential benefit, which may be a particular issue for patients with intractable pain near the end of life.

         Sympathetic blocks and neurolysis may be performed in well-chosen cases for ischemic or sympathetically mediated pain, including neuropathic pain (eg, painful diabetic neuropathy, phantom limb pain, postherpetic neuralgia), complex regional pain syndrome, and chronic abdominal, pelvic or perineal pain. Neurolytic blocks are most commonly used for intractable visceral cancer pain, particularly for pancreatic cancer. The role of sympathetic blocks for patients with pancreatic cancer is discussed separately. (See

         The most common sites for sympathetic blocks are described here. Though some of these structures are not composed solely of sympathetic fibers, it is believed that the lasting relief occurs from blocking transmission of the sympathetic signals [

          10,11

         ]. In some cases, a diagnostic local anesthesia block may be performed prior to ablation at these sites. Efficacy of a diagnostic sympathetic block should be clear within minutes of injection as evidenced by appropriate changes in blood flow, limb temperature and color, or other relevant transient autonomic signs such as a temporary Horner syndrome (ie, conjunctival injection, miosis and ptosis).

          31

The targets for the knee, hip, and sacroiliac joints, respectively, are the genicular articular nerves of the knee, articular branches of the femoral and obturator nerves in the hip, and the sacral lateral branch nerves for the sacroiliac joint. Since the ablated nerves can regenerate, a patient who has responded to a prior ablation may be eligible for a repeat ablation/neurotomy of the same targets at a later time [

        </p>
        <p>
         Patient positioning varies depending on the target nerve. RFA is performed by inserting a specialized needle through the skin, using fluoroscopy or ultrasound guidance to place the needle tip in close proximity to the target nerve, after which the lesion is created [
         <a href="#rid27">

         Chemical neurolysis is performed similarly to RFN; instead of using an RF probe, a needle is inserted and phenol, glycerol, or alcohol is injected. In our practice, phenol is used most commonly, and often comes in a viscous formulation, which can help limit its spread to surrounding tissues [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39

          40
         </a>
         ]. Another agent used for chemical neurolysis is glycerol, which is more commonly used for Gasserian ganglion rhizolysis in the trigeminal nerve pathways [

         Complications of RFN are rare, and include infection, bleeding, injury to surrounding anatomic structures (eg, nontarget nerves, blood vessels, organs), motor paresis, anesthesia dolorosa (ie, pain superimposed in an area that lacks or has impaired sensation), and motor paresis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other possible complications include acute neuritis and chronic aberrant sensory changes. The incidences of these outcomes are not well established. Adverse outcomes are thought to be more common when larger and more complex nerves are ablated (ie, larger sensory fibers or mixed sensory and motor fibers, or in younger or healthier individuals who may have more robust regenerative mechanisms).
        </p>
        <p>
         Postneurotomy neuritis is a transient, localized, burning, neuropathic pain that has been specifically described after RFN. Based on limited data, the incidence is estimated between 0.5 and 7 percent, and most cases last approximately two weeks or longer [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, neurolytic interventions have been thought to potentially carry the risk of producing a new "deafferentation pain," due to axonal sprouting and neural regeneration. In our practice, this is a rare outcome but the exact incidence of deafferentation pain is unknown. Methods that preserve neural architecture (ie, RFN) and allow for regeneration are less likely to be followed by neuritis or a deafferentation pain syndrome. Deafferentation often presents similarly to chronic neuropathic pain, characterized by dysregulated sensory function and associated allodynia, hyperesthesia and hyperpathia, as well as other forms of abnormal local sudomotor and temperature changes. Once a deafferentation pain syndrome develops, it can be difficult to treat.

         Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation involves inserting leads via the epidural space into the neuroforamen where the spinal nerve roots and DRG exit the neuraxis. The DRG is a collection of sensory cell bodies that lies within the epidural space, surrounded by a minimal amount of cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, stimulation requires very low electrical current, lower than the current required for spinal cord stimulation [

In a randomized trial that compared DRG versus spinal cord stimulator placement in patients with lower extremity CRPS or causalgia, pain relief ≥50 percent at three months was achieved in 81 percent of patients who had permanent DRG implants, compared with 56 percent who had SCS implants [

         Reported complication rates for DRG stimulators vary widely, but appear to be similar to SCS. As an example, in one retrospective study of safety reports using manufacturer records, safety events were reported in 3.2 percent of placements (based on 500 placements), and in 3.1 percent of SCS placements (based on 2000 placements) [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Infection accounted for one third of the reports. Neurologic complications are rare, usually transient, but potentially severe, including weakness, paralysis, and incontinence. Thus, guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience recommend DRG placement with the patient awake and able to report radicular pain or paresthesia, or with intraoperative neurologic monitoring if general anesthesia is necessary [

         Because peripheral nerve stimulator leads are often placed at more mobile sites than SCS or DRG stimulators, lead migration and erosion are more significant concerns with peripheral stimulators.

         Intrathecal therapy involves the use of a specialized implantable, programmable infusion pump to deliver analgesic medications and/or antispasmodics directly into the cerebral spinal fluid and the spinal cord. Intrathecal drug administration bypasses the blood brain barrier and achieves analgesia with much lower systemic levels of medications.

         Intrathecal therapy may be used for patients with intractable pain and/or severe spastic disorders for whom systemic therapy is ineffective at doses with tolerable side effects. Intrathecal therapy is used for patients with intractable cancer pain, or pain and/or spasticity as a result of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or cerebral palsy. It is most commonly done for palliative care for patients near the end of life. Intrathecal therapy is rarely necessary for patients with intractable cancer pain, but when used, it can markedly improve quality of life. It can be of particular benefit in patients with recurrent pelvic cancers or those with mesothelioma, who with adequate pain control can continue anti-neoplastic therapy.
        </p>

         Use of intrathecal therapy in specific conditions is discussed separately, as follows.

         Contraindications include infection at the insertion site, systemic infection and patient inability to tolerate the anesthetic necessary to place the device.

         The procedure may be ill advised in patients with severe cachexia and the risk of poor wound healing. Some pain specialists restrict use of intrathecal pumps to patients with life expectancy of at least three months, or occasionally two months in patients with intractable pain that is likely to respond to the pump.

         Intrathecal catheter placement is considered a high risk procedure for serious bleeding. Therefore, patients who take antithrombotic or antiplatelet medications may be asked to hold or change dosing so the procedure can be performed according to the relevant guidelines [

         The patient is typically placed in the lateral decubitus position. A needle is inserted through the skin as for lumbar puncture or spinal anesthesia, with the tip in the subarachnoid space.

         A reservoir pocket is created under the skin of the anterior abdomen, which will hold either a subcutaneous port (accessed percutaneously and used with an external pump) or a fully implanted infusion pump.

         Cancer patients who require these pumps are usually on significant doses of systemic opioids. The doses of opioids must be adjusted over the five to seven days since it often takes time to achieve an optimal intrathecal medication and infusion dose rate. Collaboration with cancer pain management or palliative care clinicians with specific expertise in intrathecal pump placement and management is strongly advised during this transition. Patients and their families need to be aware of the titration process and supported with as needed systemic medications and counseling.

         Neurolytic procedures produce analgesia by destroying afferent neural pathways or sympathetic ganglia involved in pain transmission, and should only be considered when more conservative measures fail. They are performed with thermal ablation using radiofrequency neurotomy or with chemical neurolysis using alcohol, phenol, or glycerol. (See
