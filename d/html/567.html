Children with asthma experience complete remission more frequently than adults; however, progression to severe disease is unusual in all age groups [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Although deaths do occur from asthma, they are rare, and asthma in the absence of other comorbid disease does not typically affect life expectancy [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>The natural history of asthma from infancy to adulthood will be discussed here. The diagnosis and management of asthma, the impact of inhaled glucocorticoid treatment on the progression of childhood asthma, and the role of risk factors are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5742.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/543.html" rel="external">"Asthma in adolescents and adults: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5744.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Management of persistent asthma with controller therapies", section on 'Inhaled glucocorticoids'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/547.html" rel="external">"An overview of asthma management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/572.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for asthma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INFANTS AND CHILDREN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many infants wheeze early in life, but three of four school-aged children outgrow asthma by adulthood [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. On the other hand, the majority of chronic asthma begins in the first six years of life [<a href="#rid2">2,7,8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5752.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Wheezing during the first six years</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several studies examining the natural history of wheezing and asthma in the first six years of life support the concept that there are at least two groups of children who have wheeze and asthma-like symptoms at an early age [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. One group tends to have intermittent symptoms, usually in relation to viral illnesses, and to outgrow the symptoms as the children get older. The other group, which tends to have later-onset and more persistent symptoms, is characterized by atopy, a positive family history of asthma, and an increased risk for asthma later in life. Despite identification of risk factors, prospective identification of an individual's future asthma experience is not possible [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/572.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for asthma"</a>.)</p><p>One possible explanation for transient wheezing in infants is that infants have smaller airways, which predispose them to wheezing in the face of viral infections or other insults. This possibility is supported by the observation that infants who develop lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first year of life had reduced lung function prior to developing any symptoms [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>A prospective study that followed 1623 children from before birth to age nine years examined risk factors for early transient wheeze (13 percent) and persistent wheeze (13 percent), compared with never/infrequent wheeze (74 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Paternal asthma was a risk factor for persistent wheeze in male (odds ratio [OR] 4.27, 95% CI 2.33-7.83), but not female children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maternal asthma was a risk factor for persistent wheeze in both sexes (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.04-4.35 [males]; OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.11-4.40 [females]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Race and ethnicity were risk factors for persistent asthma in female children (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.55-6.75 [Black versus all others] and OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.06-12.17[Hispanic versus nonhispanic]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bronchiolitis before age one year was a risk factor for persistent asthma in both sexes (OR 4.38, 95% CI 2.03-9.45 [females]; OR 6.49, 95% CI 3.29-12.79[males]). Atopic dermatitis was a similarly important risk factor in both sexes.</p><p></p><p>In an earlier study, 826 children were assigned to four categories according to their history of wheezing at three and six years of age: children who never wheezed; those with transient early wheezing; those with late-onset wheezing; and those with persistent wheezing [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sixty percent of children with wheezing in the first three years of life had no wheezing at six years of age. This group of transient early wheezers was distinguished from the other groups by their low pulmonary function (assessed by maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity [FRC]) both shortly after birth and at six years of age, even though they had "outgrown" their wheezing. The transient early wheezing and lower pulmonary function are likely due to smaller airways.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In contrast, children with persistent wheezing had lung function values shortly after birth that were not different from those who never wheezed. However, at six years old, they had the lowest level of lung function and the highest frequency of carrying a diagnosis of asthma (46 percent) among all groups.</p><p></p><p>Risk factors for persistent wheezing and a predisposition to asthma in this population included:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent symptoms in the first year of life</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Eczema</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated IgE levels</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maternal history of asthma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maternal smoking</p><p></p><p>Another study, from the same group of researchers, reported results from another cohort of children [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. A total of 786 children younger than five years of age were enrolled between 1972 and 1984 and followed for up to 11 years. The predictive power of various lower respiratory tract symptoms such as frequent cough, wheeze with and without colds, attacks of shortness of breath with wheeze (SOBWZ), chest colds, and a combination of cough, wheeze even without colds, or SOBWZ was assessed in relation to a subsequent diagnosis of asthma.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No single lower respiratory tract symptom before the age of one year was predictive of a diagnosis of asthma at a later age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In logistic regression analyses, children with respiratory symptoms at one to two years but no respiratory symptoms at three to four years did not have a significantly increased risk for a new diagnosis of asthma between the ages of 5 and 11 years (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.5-6.0).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In contrast, those with lower respiratory symptoms at three to four years but without symptoms at one to two years, and those with symptoms at both early age groups (ie, the groups with either late-onset symptoms or persistent symptoms), had increased risk for a new diagnosis of asthma between ages 5 and 11 years (OR = 9.2, 95% CI 3.2-26.2 and OR = 6.6, 95% CI 2.6-17.0 respectively).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Wheezing in later childhood</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It has been estimated that between 30 and 70 percent of children with asthma are markedly improved or asymptomatic by early adulthood. Several studies have examined whether certain asthma characteristics during childhood predict the presence and severity of disease decades later [<a href="#rid3">3,16-20</a>]. As examples:</p><p>A retrospective cohort study of more than 13,000 newly diagnosed asthmatics, ranging in age from 5 to 44 years, used medication records to track the progression of disease over five years. Nearly half of these patients had mild asthma, while only 7 percent presented with severe disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. When stratified by age, the following observations were noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients younger than 15 years who were diagnosed with severe asthma had significantly higher five-year rates of improvement (80 versus 61 percent) and remission (23 versus 14 percent), when compared with older patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients diagnosed with mild disease were unlikely to develop severe disease within five years, regardless of age.</p><p></p><p>A separate series of studies evaluated a cohort of 317 children with a history of wheezing to age 42, and compared them with 86 age-matched control subjects [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The prognosis depended upon the frequency of symptoms during childhood:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>86 percent of those with few symptoms at seven years of age continued to have little or no asthma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>71 percent of those with frequent wheezing at seven years still suffered from recurrent bouts of asthma.</p><p></p><p>A four year study prospectively monitored 909 children who had been enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) at ages 5 to 12 years [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Predictors of persistent asthma included atopy, low lung function, and higher airway hyperresponsiveness. Sensitization and exposure to indoor allergens were associated with three times the risk of persistent asthma. More severe asthma at study enrollment was associated with more severe asthma after four years of follow up.</p><p>Atopic sensitivity to mammalian allergens may predict persistence of asthma. In a study of 3430 Swedish children, children with persistent asthma from age 11 to 19 years were much more likely to have positive serum immunoassays for IgE specific to mammalian allergens than children without asthma (OR 9.2, 95% CI 4.5-21) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Dust mite sensitivity is much less common than mammalian allergen sensitivity in this area of Sweden due to the climate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H377363664"><span class="h2">Severe asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with severe asthma tend to have marked atopy, reversible airflow limitation, high health care utilization, and a decline in lung function over time [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. </p><p>The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) study, a three-year multicenter observational study, gathered information about the clinical course of asthma in 1261 children and adolescents with severe or difficult to control asthma [<a href="#rid22">22,23,25</a>]. Patients were managed by specialists (pulmonologists or allergists) although there was no experimental intervention. </p><p>Participants were age six or older and met one or both of the following criteria in the year before the study:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High health care utilization (as defined as two or more unscheduled visits for asthma or two or more courses of oral glucocorticoids)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High medication use (eg, requiring three or more medications to control asthma, long-term daily use of high dose inhaled glucocorticoids, or use of 5 mg daily or more of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>)</p><p></p><p>Approximately 60 percent were receiving three or more long-term controller medications. Despite this, 53 percent of children and 44 percent of adolescents required courses of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> and unscheduled visits within the three months prior to enrollment, indicating that asthma remained poorly controlled. Pulmonary function declined with age, particularly in adolescent males [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The prebronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in males declined from a mean of 0.91 at six to eight years to 0.82 at 15 to 17 years (p&lt;0.05). Prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> in female children was 0.94 at six to eight years and 0.84 at 15 to 17 years (p&lt;0.05).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Effect on future lung function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Asthma in early childhood results in decrements in pulmonary function that are persistent and detectable throughout childhood and adolescence, and even through adulthood, although the effects differ based on sex and age [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal studies of children who developed asthma before six years of age demonstrate persistent lung function abnormalities that may be associated with reduced lung growth (lower peak FEV<sub>1</sub>) and/or an "early decline" in lung function in adulthood. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>East Boston Study</strong> - Lung function was studied in a cohort of children from East Boston, aged five to nine years, over a 13-year period [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Male children with asthma experienced a larger increase in forced vital capacity (FVC) than nonasthmatic males, whereas female children with asthma had consistently lower FEV<sub>1</sub> values compared with nonasthmatic females.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Childhood Asthma Management Program</strong> – The CAMP followed the lung function of 1041 children (420 female and 621 male) with mild to moderate persistent asthma, and compared it with the lung function of 5415 nonasthmatic children from the Harvard Six Cities Study [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Between the ages of 6 and 18 years, the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio was significantly lower and FVC was significantly greater for asthmatic children, compared with nonasthmatic children. In contrast to the East Boston study, males had a lower FEV<sub>1</sub> between the ages of 10 to 18, whereas the differences in females were not significant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a follow-up study, the lung function tests of 684 of the original 1041 CAMP participants who had at least one FEV<sub>1</sub> at the age of 23 to 30 were compared with the lung function values from individuals of the same sex, race or ethnic group, age, and height from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Four trajectories of lung function were observed: 170 (25 percent) had normal growth and no early decline in adulthood; 176 (26 percent) had reduced growth (lower peak FEV<sub>1 </sub>at age 20 to 23) and an early decline in adulthood; 160 (23 percent) had reduced growth but no early decline; and 178 (26 percent) had normal growth but an early decline. Abnormal lung function in childhood and male sex were the strongest predictors of abnormal lung growth and early decline. The reduced growth and reduced growth with early decline patterns were more likely to develop into chronic irreversible airflow limitation, even in the absence of cigarette smoke exposure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the CAMP study, the duration of asthma also correlated with the degree of impairment in lung function. Baseline data from 1041 children with mild to moderate asthma in the CAMP study found a significant correlation between asthma duration and lower lung function, greater <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9622" href="/d/drug information/9622.html" rel="external">methacholine</a> responsiveness, more asthma symptoms, and greater use of as-needed <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9396" href="/d/drug information/9396.html" rel="external">albuterol</a> [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Melbourne Asthma Study</strong> - Asthma in childhood continues to influence pulmonary function later in life [<a href="#rid28">28,30-35</a>]. The Melbourne Asthma Study followed 458 children from age seven years until age 50: 105 had never wheezed, 74 had mild wheezy bronchitis, 104 had wheezy bronchitis, 113 had asthma, and 83 had severe asthma [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Both the childhood asthma and severe asthma groups had deficits in mean FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio that were established by ages 7 and 10 years and persisted through age 50 years. The patterns for FVC were not reported in this study, and sex differences were not reported.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tasmanian longitudinal health study</strong> – The Tasmanian longitudinal health study followed approximately 8500 seven-year-olds (recruited in 1968) at ages 13, 18, 30, 45, 50, and 53 years, with clinical screening and prebronchodilator spirometry at every timepoint (except age 30 years) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Of the 1040 participants with childhood-onset asthma, 79 percent had remission of disease by adolescence, 9 percent had remission in adulthood, and the remaining 12 percent had persistent asthma through middle-age. Persistent asthma from childhood was associated with a significant decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC compared with never-asthmatics at age 53 years (-15 and -7.6 percent predicted, respectively). Those with early onset remitting asthma had a small increased risk of persistently low or accelerated longitudinal decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> (OR 1.8 and 2.0, respectively), whereas those with persistent asthma had a highly elevated risk for such trajectories (OR 5.5 and 29, for persistently low or accelerated decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aberdeen</strong> - A cross-sectional, community-based study of respiratory symptoms in children was initiated in 1964 [<a href="#rid37">37</a>], with long-term follow-up of 177 participants in 2001 [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. When adjusted for age, height, sex, and smoking status, adults with childhood asthma had diminished lung function compared with nonasthmatic controls (FEV<sub>1</sub> 2.45 versus 2.96 L).

In the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, newly diagnosed asthma at age 22 years was twice as likely in females compared with males [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

A longitudinal Northern European study assessed respiratory health in 2322 female participants at baseline and again at follow-up 10 to 12 years later when they were age 45 to 65 years [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The odds of new-onset asthma were increased in those who were perimenopausal (odds ratio [OR] 2.40, 95% CI 1.09-5.30), early postmenopausal (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.06-4.20), and late postmenopausal (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.31-9.05) at follow-up compared with the nonmenopausal group. Approximately 53 percent were current or former cigarette smokers, but adjustment for smoking status did not affect the results.

Only 3 percent of patients diagnosed at age 15 or older with mild disease required treatment for severe disease five years later.

When assessed in children, inhaled glucocorticoids did not alter the natural history of asthma; benefits of inhaled glucocorticoids on asthma symptoms and lung function waned after discontinuation. These studies are discussed separately.

In one report, for example, 1095 asthmatics were compared with 16,411 normal subjects using data collected over 15 years [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The participants with asthma had a greater rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> (38 mL/year) compared with nonasthmatic participants (22 mL/year). The effect of asthma was present among smokers and nonsmokers of both sexes, although the decline was most rapid among smokers with asthma. Similarly, in the Tasmanian longitudinal health study, those who developed nonremitting adult-onset asthma were considerably more likely than nonasthmatics to demonstrate persistently low lung function or an accelerated decline in lung function (OR 5.3 and 10, respectively) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Persons with nonremitting adult-onset asthma also had an increased risk of developing nonreversible airway obstruction (postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7) by age 53 years (13 versus 2 percent compared with never-asthmatics).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severity of symptoms</strong> - The rate of loss of lung function appears to be related to the severity of symptoms. In a study of young adults between the ages of 21 and 28 years, those with the most severe symptoms had the most rapid rate of decline in the FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio compared to controls and patients with less severe asthma [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recently diagnosed asthma</strong> - The rate of decline in lung function may be greatest in those with new onset asthma. One group studied 10,952 persons who were part of an ongoing longitudinal study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, to analyze the rate of decline in lung function of adults with asthma [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Over a five-year period, 159 subjects were identified who were self-reported asthmatics at initial study and follow-up and 185 subjects who reported no asthma on initial encounter but developed asthma during the study. Those with new onset asthma had the largest loss of lung function; the excess decline, on average, was 39 mL/year in male patients and 11 mL/year in female patients when compared with declines in those without asthma. However, after controlling for the initial level of FEV<sub>1</sub>, the rates of decline were not different between the groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a subsequent report of 15 years of follow-up data from the same group, the more rapid decline in lung function of asthmatics was confirmed [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> among subjects with asthma was 38 mL per year, compared with 22 mL per year in those without asthma. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Another study of adults greater than 60 years of age also noted a rapid decline in lung function around the time of diagnosis [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Rates of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> were almost twice as high in subjects with newly diagnosed asthma as in other subjects. This phenomenon may reflect the fact that the decline in lung function was what led the patients to seek medical attention. Alternatively, it may reflect submaximal therapy, although it is uncertain that optimal treatment can modify the rapid rates of decline in asthmatics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/521.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and management of asthma in older adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cigarette smoking</strong> - Cigarette smoking may contribute to a more rapid rate of decline in lung function in patients with asthma. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, participants with asthma who smoked had the greatest rate of lung function decline compared with nonasthmatics and nonsmoking asthmatics [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Similarly, smoking and nonremitting asthma had a multiplicative effect on the degree of irreversible airway obstruction in the Tasmanian longitudinal health study [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the above studies, the Melbourne Asthma Study, which followed patients with persistent childhood asthma up to age 50 (see <a class="local">'Effect on future lung function'</a> above), did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline between the asthmatic groups and the non-asthmatics [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, this observation may be due to the relatively small number of subjects and the substantial deficits in lung function at a young age that did not leave much room for further decline in lung function. Similarly, data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) suggest that reduced lung growth due to early onset persistent childhood asthma has a greater impact on adult lung function than decline in lung function.
