The other beta globin mutation could be the sickle mutation or a different mutation in the beta globin gene (eg, one associated with beta thalassemia, hemoglobin C disease, or others). Patients with SCD exhibit a clinical phenotype, anemia, and laboratory evidence of sickling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7115.html" rel="external">"Overview of compound sickle cell syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HSCT</strong> – Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT, also called hematopoietic cell transplant [HCT]) is used to refer to transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from any source (bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Allogeneic</strong> – Allogeneic HSCT refers to HSCT using hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a donor. The donor may be related (eg, sibling) or unrelated. Related donors can be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (typically, matched at eight of eight HLA loci) or haploidentical (matched at half of their HLA loci).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Autologous</strong> – Autologous HSCT refers to HSCT using the patient's own HSCs. This is not useful for individuals with SCD unless the autologous cells have been modified (eg, by gene therapy, which is experimental). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110324.html" rel="external">"Investigational therapies for sickle cell disease", section on 'Gene therapy and gene editing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Conditioning</strong> – Conditioning regimens (also called preparative regimens) for HSCT can be myeloablative, nonmyeloablative, or reduced-intensity. These are defined as follows, with additional details presented separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3557.html" rel="external">"Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Myeloablative</strong> – These regimens destroy the recipient's bone marrow, causing aplasia and pancytopenia that is usually long-lasting and irreversible. Infusion of HSCs is required to reconstitute hematopoiesis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Nonmyeloablative</strong> – These regimens do not destroy the recipient's bone marrow or cause significant cytopenias; however, engrafting donor T cells usually eliminate host hematopoietic cells.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>RIC </strong>– Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are intermediate between myeloablative and nonmyeloablative. These regimens cause cytopenias and suppress the host's immune system to allow engraftment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sources of HSCs</strong> – These include bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood (referred to as cord blood). Bone marrow is generally preferred for nonmalignant disorders because it contains a lower dose of T cells and confers a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (See <a class="local">'Optimal source of HSCs'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1397473957"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR TRANSPLANT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with SCD should have the opportunity to discuss risks and benefits of HSCT with their primary hematologist in order to better understand whether to pursue an HSCT evaluation. The evaluation does not necessarily imply that HSCT is indicated. It is a consultation and opportunity to understand the procedure, expected outcomes, and in some cases, to determine whether a sibling is a potential donor or whether there are other donor options that can be pursued.</p><p>The most common indications for HSCT evaluation are vaso-occlusive complications of SCD that are not well controlled with medical therapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> or chronic transfusions). These may include frequent pain episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, or silent cerebral ischemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Curative treatments'</a>.)</p><p>Allogeneic HSCT and autologous transplant using gene therapy/gene editing are the only potentially curative options in clinical use for individuals with SCD. However, the morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT are not insignificant. Thus, HSCT is only appropriate for individuals for whom the potential for cure outweighs the potential risks of early death, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and other potential toxicities such as organ injury from the conditioning regimen. </p><p>In some cases, parents or guardians of children with SCD, children with SCD, and health care providers may consider poor quality of life due to multiple vaso-occlusive pain events as the only indication for HSCT. However, in high-income settings, children with SCD have a 99 percent probability of survival until 18 years of age. Thus, the decision to consider HSCT must consider that SCD in a child is no longer associated with a shortened lifespan. For adults, the median survival of 48 years has not changed considerably, and the risk-benefit ratio favors HSCT in adults with SCD; this should be considered when evaluating curative therapy in this population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Survival and prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2907091348"><span class="h1">DECISION TO PURSUE TRANSPLANT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3247743065"><span class="h2">Overview of decision-making</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to pursue HSCT is a challenging one. HSCT is most likely to benefit individuals at risk for severe vaso-occlusive manifestations such as stroke, acute chest syndrome, and pain, especially when performed during childhood. However, it may not be possible to predict which children are most likely to develop these complications, due to clinical variability of the disease and the absence of validated biomarkers for disease severity or mortality. </p><p>Also, it is possible that additional disease-modifying therapies may become available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110324.html" rel="external">"Investigational therapies for sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p>HSCT has not been directly compared with optimally administered medical therapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> and/or transfusions) in a clinical trial or even in contemporaneous cohorts, and comparisons with historical controls are problematic because improvements in both HSCT and medical therapy continue to accrue. (See <a class="local">'Clinical experience/transplant outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, the decision to pursue HSCT is highly individualized. HSCT is more likely to be appropriate for those who place a high value on cure of the disease and on avoiding chronic therapies such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> or transfusions.</p><p>The use of HSCT is limited in SCD for a number of reasons [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved outcomes with intensive medical therapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a>, chronic transfusions, other disease-modifying therapies), reducing the need for HSCT</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Concerns about transplant-related morbidity and mortality</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Possible effects of end-organ damage from SCD (eg, pulmonary, renal dysfunction) that may interfere with HSCT protocols</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extensive red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization that complicates transfusion support in the peri-HSCT period</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Concern about effects on fertility</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limited availability of matched sibling donors</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limited experience in transplanting adults with SCD</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limited knowledge about late health effects after HSCT on preexisting heart, lung, or kidney disease, which are the major causes of mortality in adults with SCD</p><p></p><p>Based on these concerns and other data, a 2014 evidence-based guideline from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, which was endorsed by other societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Society of Hematology, stated that "Additional research regarding patient and donor selection and the specific transplantation procedure is required before this potentially curative therapy will become more widely available" [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>Experts have presented views in favor of and against HSCT for children with symptomatic disease in a 2017 point-counterpoint discussion [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pro</strong> – Some of the main points in support of HSCT include [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medical therapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a>, transfusions) is associated with risks and burdens that may interfere with their use, whereas HSCT offers an option for cure.

When possible, HSCT is performed as part of a clinical trial with a Data and Safety Monitoring Board and formal stopping rules, especially if nonstandard approaches are used. (See <a class="local">'Clinical experience/transplant outcomes'</a> below and <a class="local">'Modifications of the standard protocol (investigational)'</a> below.)</p><p>Some adolescents and young adults may be willing to accept the risks associated with the HSCT procedure, and HSCT may be a reasonable choice for these individuals. (See <a class="local">'Experience in older adolescents and adults'</a> below.) </p><p>However, because less toxic therapies are available, mortality from HSCT may be as high as 5 to 10 percent, parents (or individuals with SCD) may reasonably choose not to pursue HSCT even if they have a suitable related donor. Further, several new medical approaches are under investigation, and some individuals may prefer to wait and see how these therapies perform in clinical trials. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110324.html" rel="external">"Investigational therapies for sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p>For individuals who wish to pursue HSCT but lack an HLA-matched related donor, alternative donors or alternative approaches may be appropriate, although these are best pursued in the setting of a clinical trial. (See <a class="local">'Modifications of the standard protocol (investigational)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1136061393"><span class="h2">Optimal age for transplant</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children versus adults</strong> – In a 2017 retrospective series of 1000 individuals with SCD who underwent allogenic HSCT, the five-year overall survival for those transplanted when &lt;16 years of age was 95 percent (95% CI 93-97 percent); the five-year overall survival for those transplanted when 16 years or older was 81 percent (95% CI 74-88 percent) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older children versus younger children</strong> – A 2017 report retrospectively evaluated outcomes in 161 children treated with HSCT for SCD in the United States following transplant [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. This represented 90 percent of the children transplanted for SCD in two databases (the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research [CIBMTR] and the Pediatric Health Information System [PHIS]). The children were divided into cohorts based on age at transplantation (&lt;10 years or 10 to 21 years). Overall survival at two years was 90 percent. Compared with those &lt;10 years, children transplanted from age 10 to 21 years had an increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 21.2, 95% CI 2.8-160.8).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1735651037"><span class="h2">Optimal donor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Siblings (or other HLA-matched first-degree relatives such as parents or children) are always preferable as HSCT donors for individuals with SCD. These donors are associated with the greatest survival, lowest rates of graft failure/rejection, and reduced transplant morbidities, especially lower risks of GVHD. Siblings without SCD and siblings with sickle cell trait are both acceptable as donors; inclusion of siblings with sickle cell trait as potential donors expands the donor pool to approximately three-quarters of the patient's HLA-matched siblings, although the proportion of individuals with suitable donors remains small.</p><p>Experience using cord blood from a sibling donor is limited [<a href="#rid11">11,13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Optimal source of HSCs'</a> below.)</p><p>The possibility of using alternative donors (eg, haploidentical siblings, matched unrelated donors, matched unrelated cord blood units) has also been raised but is considered investigational. These alternative donors are best pursued on a clinical trial, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Alternative donors'</a> below.)</p><p>Other aspects of donor selection and the effect of donor characteristics (cytomegalovirus [CMV] status, age, parity) on transfusion outcomes are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H204684782"><span class="h2">Optimal source of HSCs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be derived from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, or mobilized peripheral blood. These sources have not been directly compared or extensively analyzed in individuals with SCD. However, it is reasonable to extrapolate from other nonmalignant disorders.</p><p>Although data are limited in SCD, data from individuals treated with HSCT for other nonmalignant disorders suggests that bone marrow or umbilical cord blood is likely to be associated with the best outcomes. This is because bone marrow- and cord blood-derived HSCs have a lower risk of causing GVHD than peripheral blood-derived HSCs.

Instead, we favor trials performed in a consortium with formal stopping rules for safety and futility along with a DSMB.

He received two DLI infusions that resulted in easily treated acute GVHD, followed by complete donor chimerism. Two years after the second DLI, he had a normal hemoglobin concentration and excellent growth and development.

The most common indications are vaso-occlusive complications of SCD not well controlled with medical therapy (frequent pain, acute chest syndrome, stroke, or silent cerebral ischemia). (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications for transplant evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Decision-making</strong> – The decision to pursue transplant is challenging due to significant risks, even in optimal settings. Transplant has not been directly compared with optimally administered medical therapy. Decisions must be individualized. Transplant is typically pursued for progressive organ dysfunction (strokes; osteonecrosis; worsening renal, cardiac, or pulmonary function) or continued vaso-occlusive complications. (See <a class="local">'Overview of decision-making'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Optimal conditions</strong> – Optimal conditions include transplantation in early childhood using a matched related (usually sibling) donor and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) harvested from bone marrow rather than from peripheral blood. (See <a class="local">'Optimal age for transplant'</a> above and <a class="local">'Optimal donor'</a> above and <a class="local">'Optimal source of HSCs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Planning </strong>– The pretransplant evaluation includes infectious disease screening and testing for comorbidities. Standard myeloablative conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis, and infection prevention measures are used; however, immunosuppression is given for a longer period of time than used in individuals with malignant disease indications (typical duration of six months before tapering). (See <a class="local">'Preparation for transplant'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy and safety</strong> – Children who receive a related donor transplant have an overall survival of 91 to 96 percent. Increasing age appears to confer lower survival and higher toxicity. Those with good engraftment (donor chimerism of ≥20 percent) can expect to be cured. Infertility is common but not universal. The risk of acute and chronic GVHD is approximately 15 percent. (See <a class="local">'Clinical experience/transplant outcomes'</a> above and <a class="local">'Assessing engraftment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alternative donors and other curative approaches</strong> – Alternative donors include unrelated cord blood (UCB) units, matched unrelated donors (MUD), and haploidentical donors. Alternative regimens include reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative (NMA). Gene therapy using modified autologous stem cells is under investigation. These approaches are experimental and should be pursued only in the context of a clinical study.
