         Organ sharing is a nationwide system by which deceased-donor kidneys are allocated to potential recipients. The deceased-donor kidney allocation policy of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) was extensively revised and implemented December 4, 2014 and is presented in this topic review.

         A national kidney allocation policy was established in the United States in 1987 for the purpose of the equitable and utilitarian distribution of deceased-donor kidneys.
        </p>

         The policy was initially devised and agreed upon by the transplant programs that comprise the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN).

          revised UNOS/OPTN policy

         Additional priority is given to candidates with less common blood types (that is, type B and type O) and high immune system sensitivity (estimated by the calculated panel reactive antibody [CPRA] score) since such candidates have fewer opportunities for transplantation.

         In general, kidneys are allocated locally first, then regionally, and then nationally, although exceptions are made for zero-mismatched kidneys and for highly sensitized candidates. (See

         </span>
         The EPTS score estimates for each waitlisted candidate &gt;18 years of age the number of years of benefit from a kidney transplant. The EPTS score is based upon candidate age, time on dialysis, absence or presence of diabetes, and history of prior solid organ transplant. The score is calculated for each candidate upon registration on the waiting list. The score is updated daily and any time the transplant hospital reports a change in any EPTS factor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Twenty percent of kidneys that are estimated to function the longest are allocated to candidates that are expected to need the allograft for the longest time.

         The KDPI is derived from the kidney donor risk index (KDRI) score and is the percentage of donors in a reference population that have a KDRI score less than or equal to the donor's KDRI score.
        </p>
        <p>
         The KDRI estimates the relative risk of posttransplant graft failure and is calculated from the donor age, ethnicity, creatinine, history of hypertension or diabetes, cause of death, height, weight, hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and whether the kidney was donated after circulatory death. The reference population is reviewed annually by the OPTN Kidney Transplantation Committee. The 15 percent of kidneys with the highest KDPI scores, estimated to have the shortest potential lifespan, are offered over a wider geographic area. It is expected that this feature will increase the utilization of donated kidneys and minimize differences in local transplant waiting times. The policy does not affect the decision process between the potential recipient and his/her transplant team; potential recipients may still turn down kidneys that are deemed unsuitable. Transplant programs must have informed consent from potential recipients in order to accept kidneys with a KDPI score &gt;85 percent (

         Candidates are ranked both by score and by the date and time of registration on the waiting list. Candidates who have waited the longest have a higher priority compared with those with shorter waiting times. (See

        <p>
         For candidates ≥18 years old, the calculation of waiting-list time is based upon the earliest of the following:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For candidates &lt;18 years old, waiting-list time begins either the date of registration or the date of initiation of dialysis, whichever is earliest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Predialysis patients who are referred for transplantation with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that is already ≤20 mL/min are not retroactively assigned waiting time to the date that their GFR became ≤20 mL/min. As a result, early referral of predialysis patients for transplant is important in order to maximize their waiting time.

         Highly sensitized waiting-list candidates are awarded incremental points based upon the degree of sensitization. The degree of sensitization is defined by the candidate's unacceptable antigens, reported at the time of listing. Unacceptable antigens are HLA antigens on a donor kidney to which a potential candidate has antibodies. Antibodies are determined using at least one solid-phase immunoassay (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] or Luminex using purified HLA molecules) and expressed as the CPRA. Each candidate is assigned a CPRA score, which expresses the percentage of deceased donors in the donor pool expected to have one or more of the unacceptable antigens. The CPRA is derived from HLA antigen/allele group and haplotype frequencies for the different racial/ethnic groups in proportion to their representation in the national deceased-donor population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Each center may define the criteria for unacceptable antigens that are considered as contraindications for transplantation. It is the prerogative of the transplant center to establish criteria for additional unacceptable antigens, such as repeat transplant mismatches. A CPRA will be calculated automatically when the unacceptable antigens are listed or updated on the waiting list.
        </p>
        <p>
         For candidates with CPRA &gt;99 or 100 percent, written approval of unacceptable antigens must be provided by the HLA laboratory director and the transplant physician and surgeon.

         Zero-mismatched kidneys and kidneys for candidates with CPRA &gt;99 percent must be shared nationally. A zero-antigen mismatch occurs when the patient and donor have zero nonequivalent HLA-A, B, and DR antigens and compatible blood types. Such kidneys are shared because allograft survival has been shown to be superior to all other match grades [

         No points are assigned to patients based upon medical urgency for national allocation of kidneys. Locally, the patient's physician has the authority to use medical judgment in assignment of medical urgency points if there is only one kidney transplant center. When there is more than one local kidney transplant center, a cooperative medical decision is required prior to assignment of medical urgency points.

         One study that compared Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) data one year before and after implementation of the revised KAS found a 23 percent reduction in transplants in which the donor and recipient age differed by more than 30 years [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. There was an initial sharp increase in transplants for recipients with a CPRA of 99 to 100 percent and those with at least 10 years on dialysis, followed by a tapering of transplants to these groups suggesting a bolus effect. Kidneys were more frequently shipped long distance, with a consequent increase in cold ischemia times. Although higher delayed graft function rates were noted, six-month graft survival rates were unchanged.

         ]. Key findings included an increase in both regional (12.5 percent post-KAS versus 8.8 percent pre-KAS) and national (19.1 percent post-KAS versus 12.7 percent pre-KAS) imports. The proportion of recipients &gt;30 years older than their donor decreased from 19 to 15 percent, while the proportion of recipients with a CPRA of 100 percent increased from 1 to 10 percent. Although the overall rate of deceased-donor kidney transplants (DDKTs) did not change, DDKT rates increased for Black transplant candidates and Hispanic transplant candidates, as well as for candidates aged 18 to 40 years; DDKT rates decreased for candidates aged &gt;50 years. Rates of delayed graft function increased from 25 percent pre-KAS to 30 percent post-KAS.

          2021 CHANGES TO KIDNEY ALLOCATION

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         In March 2021, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) implemented substantive changes to the way that organs are allocated nationally. This change was triggered to bring organ allocation into full alignment with the Final Rule, which requires that available organs for transplantation be medically prioritized among potential recipients regardless of geographic location. The goal was to ensure that policy is legal, equitable, maximizes lives saved, and minimizes the effect of geography [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As of March 15, 2021, the UNOS and OPTN policy states that donor kidneys are to be offered first to candidates listed at transplant hospitals within 250 nautical miles of the donor hospital from where the kidney was recovered. If no candidates in this area match with and accept the kidney, it is then offered to candidates listed at hospitals beyond 250 nautical miles. Recipient candidates are scored on their proximity to the donor hospital, so the point assignment will be highest for those closest to the available kidney. If a donor kidney is considered a perfect match for someone on the national recipient list, it is offered to that person no matter their distance from the donor hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
         These changes have been abbreviated as KAS250. An early Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) analysis of the first nine months since its implementation showed a twofold increase in kidneys imported from nonlocal organ procurement organizations (OPO), a higher proportion of recipients with calculated panel reactive antibody (CPRA) 81 to 98 percent (12 versus 8 percent) and with &gt;5 years of pretransplant dialysis (35 versus 33 percent) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Cold ischemia time (CIT) increased a mean of two hours, including among local OPO kidneys, but rates of delayed graft function were similar on adjusted analysis. There was an increase over time in the rate of "discards" of donor kidneys that was independent of donor quality. Use of machine perfusion decreased while reliance on virtual crossmatch increased; use of the virtual crossmatch was associated with shorter CIT. To date, there have been no cost-effectiveness analyses performed.

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Organ sharing is a nationwide system by which deceased-donor kidneys are allocated to potential recipients based upon human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient as well as multiple other donor kidney and recipient characteristics. A national kidney allocation policy was established in the United States in 1987 for the purpose of the equitable and utilitarian distribution of deceased-donor kidneys. A revised

         <strong>
          National deceased-donor kidney allocation policy
         </strong>
         – The allocation of kidneys is based upon donor kidney and candidate characteristics and on the candidate's waiting-list time. The estimated posttransplant survival (EPTS) score estimates the number of years of benefit from a kidney transplant, and the kidney donor profile index (KDPI) classifies kidneys according to their predicted survival once transplanted. Priority is also accorded to candidates with less common blood types and high immune system sensitivity since such candidates have fewer opportunities for transplantation. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          EPTS score
         </strong>
         – The EPTS score is based upon candidate age, time on dialysis, absence or presence of diabetes, and history of prior solid organ transplant and is calculated for each candidate upon registration on waiting list. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Estimated posttransplant survival (EPTS) score'

         <strong>
          KDPI
         </strong>
         – The KDPI is derived from the kidney donor risk index (KDRI) score, which is the percentage of donors in a reference population that have a KDRI score less than or equal to the donor's KDRI score. The KDRI is calculated from the donor characteristics. (See

          Waiting time
         </strong>

         For candidates &lt;18 years old, waiting-list time begins either the date of registration or the date of initiation of dialysis, whichever is earliest. (See

          Sensitized candidates
         </strong>
         – Highly sensitized waiting-list candidates are awarded points based upon the degree of sensitization, which is reported for each candidate at the time of listing. Unacceptable antigens are HLA antigens on a donor kidney to which a potential candidate has antibodies that preclude transplantation. Each center may define the criteria for unacceptable antigens that are considered as contraindications for transplantation. (See

         <strong>
          Mandatory sharing
         </strong>
         – Zero-mismatched kidneys and kidneys for candidates with a calculated panel reactive antibody (CPRA) &gt;99 percent must be shared nationally. A zero-antigen mismatch occurs when the patient and donor have zero nonequivalent HLA-A, B, and DR antigens and compatible blood types. Such kidneys are shared because allograft survival has been shown to be superior to all other match grades. (See
