Physiologic cysts (eg, follicular cyst, corpus luteal cyst) or, less commonly, pathologic cysts (eg, endometriomas, benign adult teratomas, cystadenomas, malignant neoplasms) may rupture, resulting in release of cyst contents (eg, serous fluid, blood, sebaceous material) that may irritate the peritoneal cavity.</p><p>Most symptomatic patients with a ruptured ovarian cyst are successfully managed with observation and analgesics; however, some patients require surgery. Decisions regarding management are based on examination findings, severity of symptoms, presence of ongoing bleeding and/or hemodynamic instability, and the presumptive histologic diagnosis.</p><p>Diagnosis and management of patients with a ruptured ovarian cyst are reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of adnexal masses that are not ruptured are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83704.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3204.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Differential diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3208.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Ultrasound categorization"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2696715566"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the normal menstrual cycle, physiologic rupture of follicular cysts, which typically are &lt;3 cm in size, occur with every ovulatory cycle. This cyclic event is generally asymptomatic or associated with mild mid-cycle pain (also referred to as mittelschmerz), likely due to the release of a small amount of blood with follicular capsule rupture.</p><p>Serous fluids are not typically irritating, and patients with rupture of a simple cyst may remain asymptomatic despite accumulation of a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid. By contrast, rupture of a hemorrhagic cyst is often associated with pain; this may be due to blood accumulating in the ovary and stretching the ovarian cortex, or blood flowing into the abdomen and irritating the visceral peritoneum. Just as ovulation pain is not always perceived in all patients, some patients may not perceive small amounts of hemoperitoneum. Rupture of a dermoid cyst with spillage of sebaceous material may cause a marked granulomatous reaction and chemical peritonitis, which is usually quite painful. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3236.html" rel="external">"Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Mature teratoma (dermoid)'</a>.)</p><p>The right ovary is more commonly affected, possibly because the rectosigmoid colon protects the left ovary (during vaginal intercourse or from abdominal trauma). In a series of 244 cases of ovarian cysts, 63 percent were right-sided [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H603355275"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The true incidence of ruptured ovarian cysts is not known. Hospital admission rates with a diagnosis of a benign ovarian cyst provide some information for calculating an incidence. However, these rates are an overestimate, because they also include admission for other complications of ovarian cysts (eg, hemorrhage, torsion).</p><p>Ruptured ovarian cyst is most likely to occur in patients of reproductive age. In a series of 70 patients with a ruptured corpus luteum, the average age was 27 years [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Postmenopausal patients with ovarian cyst rupture have also been reported [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1089116575"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS AND PREVENTION</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Conditions that predispose a patient to ovarian cyst formation – Conditions that predispose a patient to ovarian cyst formation (eg, ovulation induction, prior history of ovarian cysts) increase the risk of cyst rupture [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Current, known cyst – Patients with current, known cysts (eg, endometrioma, teratoma, tubo-ovarian abscess) are at an increased risk of rupture. This is discussed in more detail below. (See <a class="local">'Special considerations'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Vaginal intercourse<strong> </strong>–<strong> </strong>Vaginal intercourse appears to be a risk factor for ovarian cyst rupture, although in some reports, postcoital hematoperitoneum has been attributed to a ruptured cyst even without a cyst ever being visualized [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other – Ruptured ovarian cysts in patients with thrombocytopenia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>] or receiving anticoagulation therapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] have also been described.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives – Hormonal therapies that suppress ovulation (eg, combined oral contraceptive pills [COCs]) may prevent the development of new cysts, thus reducing the risk of ruptured ovarian cyst. However, COCs do not always prevent ovulation. In a review of the literature, the overall incidence of ovulation in COCs users was found to be 2 percent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. COCs with lower estrogen amounts were less likely to suppress ovulation compared with higher-dose COCs. By contrast, progestin-only pills (POPs) are less likely to suppress ovulation; in this study, the incidence of ovulation in POP users was 42 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Surgical drainage or removal – While surgical drainage or removal of an existing cyst may prevent future cyst rupture, prevention of cyst rupture is <strong>not</strong> a surgical indication. Rather, surgical drainage or removal of a cyst is performed only for other indications (eg, relieve symptoms, provide a histologic diagnosis for patients in whom malignancy is suspected).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rupture of an ovarian cyst may be asymptomatic or associated with pelvic and/or abdominal pain (see <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above). The classic presentation is the sudden onset of unilateral, lower abdominal pain, often following strenuous physical activity (eg, sexual intercourse, exercise) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A history of ovarian cysts, or a known current ovarian cyst, should raise suspicion for this diagnosis.</p><p>The character of the pain is typically sharp and focal, and the intensity may be moderate or severe. In cases of massive hemorrhage, shoulder pain or upper abdominal pain is present due to subphrenic blood extravasation. In addition, patients may have increased pain with sitting, possibly due to psoas irritation.</p><p>Due to the severity of the pain, patients usually present to the emergency department or other urgent care setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1475184574"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Findings on physical examination are variable.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vital signs – In most patients, vital signs are usually in the normal range. While a low-grade fever may be present, fever ≥100.4 may be a sign of another infectious process. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Any signs of hemodynamic instability require that the evaluation for bleeding and potential surgery be expedited (see <a class="local">'Hemodynamic instability'</a> below). However, in young healthy patients, vital signs, including postural changes, may be normal early in the course of significant bleeding due to compensatory mechanisms. In addition, some patients with acute hemoperitoneum and hypotension may not show tachycardia or may display bradycardia [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. Significant hemorrhage leading to shock is uncommon. Because patients may initially present as hemodynamically stable, their hemoglobin/hematocrit should be rechecked if there is concern for ongoing blood loss. (See <a class="local">'Heavy or ongoing blood loss'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal examination – One side of the lower abdomen is often tender to palpation. As noted above, the right lower quadrant is more commonly affected (see <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above). Rupture of a simple cyst usually results in only mild to moderate tenderness on deep palpation. By contrast, patients with a large volume of intraperitoneal blood will have tenderness and possibly peritoneal signs. Similarly, release of sebaceous material or blood into the abdomen may cause overt peritonitis with rigidity of the abdominal wall and rebound tenderness. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Intra-abdominal hemorrhage may also be associated with Cullen's sign (ie, periumbilical ecchymoses)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88950" href="/z/d/graphic/88950.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pelvic examination – If the cyst has not completely collapsed, an adnexal mass may be palpable on bimanual examination. Cervical motion tenderness may also be present.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H603355123"><span class="h2">Laboratory findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laboratory abnormalities may be absent or include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low hemoglobin/hematocrit – Low hemoglobin/hematocrit may be caused by hemorrhage, although the initial hemoglobin/hematocrit may be normal or mildly decreased with acute blood loss.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thrombocytopenia – Severe thrombocytopenia can worsen bleeding associated with cyst rupture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The white blood cell count is typically normal or only mildly elevated with cyst rupture; therefore, leukocytosis or left shift should raise suspicion of an infectious or necrotic process as the etiology of the symptoms rather than cyst rupture.</p><p></p><p>We do not routinely test serum CA 125 in patients with suspected ruptured ovarian cyst. Rather, we perform this test only if there is a suspicion of ovarian cancer. It is important to note that CA 125 may be elevated with hemoperitoneum or irritation of the peritoneum by cyst contents, as well as a number of other benign conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81621" href="/z/d/graphic/81621.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83704.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass", section on 'Role of tumor markers and multimodal tests'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H616881180"><span class="h2">Imaging studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pelvic ultrasound is the mainstay of evaluation as it is readily available, inexpensive, is a sensitive method for detecting ovarian cysts, and does not expose a patient to radiation. Sonographic findings suggestive of ruptured ovarian cyst include  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef134632" href="/z/d/graphic/134632.html" rel="external">image 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An adnexal mass and fluid in the pelvis; however, fluid may be present in the pelvis without a ruptured cyst. A small amount of anechoic fluid in the pelvis is a normal finding in patients of reproductive age. If the fluid has debris within it, then it is suspicious for blood (eg, from a ruptured cyst or an ectopic pregnancy) or infection. Scanning with the vaginal probe in the region of the mass will often elicit pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rupture of cyst contents typically yields only a small pool of peritoneal fluid, but large amounts of fluid may be present if rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage. If bloody-appearing fluid is seen extending beyond the upper margin of the uterus on ultrasound, then the upper abdomen should be evaluated by abdominal ultrasound. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ultrasound evaluation performed as part of the initial examination in hemodynamically unstable patients is known as the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST); this is readily employed in most emergency departments. With FAST, four areas are evaluated in a timely fashion including the pericardium, right flank (hepatorenal recess or Morison's pouch), left flank (perisplenic view), and pelvis (retrovesical view). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13853.html" rel="external">"Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma", section on 'Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infrequently, the cyst that has ruptured will be seen with a break in the cyst wall and surrounding clot. This allows for the imaging diagnosis of a ruptured cyst. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Features suggestive of malignancy or a specific pathology (eg, dermoid cyst), if present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3208.html" rel="external">"Adnexal mass: Ultrasound categorization"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>We do not find computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to be useful in the evaluation of a ruptured ovarian cyst; these imaging modalities are associated with increased expense and additional radiation exposure (computed tomography). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2643223833"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging of the pelvis, preferably with pelvic ultrasound, is the mainstay of evaluation in patients in whom ovarian cyst rupture is suspected. Human chorionic gonadotropin, complete blood count, blood type and crossmatch (in patients with peritoneal signs or hemodynamic instability), and testing for sexually transmitted disease are also obtained to aid in the differential diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a class="local">'Imaging studies'</a> above and <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A definitive diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst is made by the visualization of an ovarian cyst that is leaking fluid or blood or has evidence of capsular disruption at the time of surgical evaluation or, less frequently, on pelvic ultrasound. (See <a class="local">'Surgical procedure'</a> below and <a class="local">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p>A presumptive diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst can be made with a fair degree of confidence in a patient with a symptom pattern that is consistent with this condition (see <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above), and with sonographic findings of an ovarian cyst plus blood or a large amount of serous fluid in the pelvis. While an ovarian cyst is not always visualized, as the cyst may collapse after cyst rupture, the absence of a cyst makes the diagnosis less likely.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst includes other conditions associated with pelvic or abdominal pain, hemoperitoneum, or a peritoneal fluid collection. The most common or urgent differential diagnoses are discussed here; the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and evaluation of acute pelvic pain is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6860.html" rel="external">"Causes of abdominal pain in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5473.html" rel="external">"Acute pelvic pain in nonpregnant adult females: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ectopic pregnancy</strong> – Ectopic pregnancy is the most important diagnosis to exclude, since it may be life-threatening. In patients with acute pelvic pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test strongly suggests the presence of an ectopic pregnancy if an intrauterine pregnancy cannot be visualized sonographically. If an intrauterine pregnancy is visualized, then pelvic pain and intraperitoneal fluid could be due to a ruptured ovarian cyst (eg, corpus luteum cyst, theca lutein cyst) or heterotopic pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5487.html" rel="external">"Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adnexal torsion</strong> – Adnexal torsion is another condition that closely mimics the presentation of a ruptured cyst and requires urgent surgery to avoid loss of function of the ovary or fallopian tube. Nausea and vomiting frequently accompany torsion, but are less common with cyst rupture. Imaging studies of patients with adnexal torsion typically show an enlarged edematous ovary on the side of the patient's pain; Doppler examination may or may not show flow to the ovary due to incomplete occlusion, intermittent torsion, and collateral blood supply. When a cyst is the cause of torsion, the distinction between a ruptured cyst and torsion may be difficult. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3305.html" rel="external">"Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Appendicitis</strong> – Appendicitis also presents with lower abdominal pain; however, the typical time course and character of the pain are somewhat different. The classic presentation of appendicitis is a dull periumbilical pain followed by sharp pain that localizes to the right lower quadrant if rupture occurs. Appendicitis is also classically accompanied by nausea, anorexia, and a low-grade fever. Since the presence of an ovarian cyst is common in reproductive-age patients, this finding alone should not exclude a diagnosis of appendicitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1386.html" rel="external">"Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</strong> – Lower abdominal pain is the cardinal presenting symptom in patients with PID. The onset of pain is more gradual than that with ruptured ovarian cysts, it is likely to occur during or shortly after menses rather than midcycle, and it is typically bilateral rather than unilateral. Free intraperitoneal fluid (pus) may or may not be observed on imaging. Tests for sexually transmitted infections should be obtained from patients with concomitant fever and/or peritoneal symptoms to exclude PID. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7581.html" rel="external">"Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Tubo-ovarian abscess</strong> <strong>(TOA)</strong> – TOA is a subset of PID presenting with fever and lower abdominal pain. The characteristic sonographic appearance of an abscess is a complex, multilocular, highly vascular mass in which the ovary margins are ill defined and unseparable from the potentially dilated fallopian tube. This complex adnexal appearance is not found in a ruptured ovarian cyst. While blood around the cyst may make the ovary margins difficult to assess, TOA will be hyperemic, whereas rupture of an ovarian cyst may show some flow in the cyst wall, but not throughout the entire mass, which includes surrounding blood clot. Rupture of a TOA requires urgent treatment to avoid sepsis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7589.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)</strong> – OHSS is an iatrogenic complication of ovulation induction therapy and may be accompanied by, or mistaken for, cyst rupture. While mild OHSS is characterized by bilateral ovarian enlargement with multiple follicular and corpus luteum cysts, severe OHSS is characterized by large ovarian cysts, ascites, and, in some patients, pleural and/or pericardial effusion, electrolyte imbalance (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), hypovolemia, and hypovolemic shock. Marked hemoconcentration, increased blood viscosity, and thromboembolic phenomena including disseminated intravascular coagulation occur in the most severe cases.

We rely on the patient's vital signs and hemoglobin/hematocrit trend as it may not be immediately apparent if bleeding is ongoing or has stopped. In our experience, bleeding stops in the majority of cases. This may be due to tamponade from increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by the volume of blood.</p><p>If the patient has stable vital signs and a stable hemoglobin/hematocrit, we suggest observation rather than immediate surgery. The patient is hospitalized, administered fluid replacement, and monitored with frequent vital signs and serial hemoglobin/hematocrit testing. Repeat pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for an increased volume of blood is performed when there is uncertainty if bleeding is ongoing [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. If on serial evaluation, the hemoglobin/hematocrit continues to decrease or the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, we recommend surgery.

Nonhemorrhagic cyst fluid (from follicular or corpus luteum cysts) is usually resorbed within 24 hours and symptoms typically resolve within a few days. By contrast, a large volume hemoperitoneum may take several weeks to resolve.

Physiologic cysts (eg, follicular cyst, corpus luteal cyst) or pathologic cysts (eg, endometriomas, malignant neoplasms) may rupture resulting in release of cyst contents (eg, serous fluid, blood, sebaceous material) that may irritate the peritoneal cavity. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – Cyst rupture may be asymptomatic, associated with mild mid-cycle pain (also referred to as mittelschmerz), or may be characterized by the sudden onset of unilateral, lower abdominal pain, often following strenuous physical activity (eg, sexual intercourse, exercise). (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Pelvic imaging, preferably with ultrasound, is the mainstay of evaluation in symptomatic patients in whom ruptured ovarian cyst is suspected.

A presumptive diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst can be made with a fair degree of confidence in a patient with a symptom pattern that is consistent with this condition, and with sonographic findings of an ovarian cyst plus blood or a large amount of serous fluid in the pelvis. The absence of a cyst makes the diagnosis less likely.
