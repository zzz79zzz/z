         Pregnancy adds a unique and, at times, challenging facet to the management of neurologic disease. The pregnant state can affect many neurologic diseases, while certain neurologic diseases or their treatments may have a significant negative effect on pregnancy, labor, or delivery. This topic review will focus on the relationship between pregnancy and a wide spectrum of neurologic illnesses.

         Headaches may present during pregnancy. Most are migraine and tension-type headaches, but they may present some treatment challenges during this time. A minority of new headaches during pregnancy represent more serious, even life-threatening neurologic conditions. This topic is discussed separately. (See

         Cerebrovascular disease during pregnancy results from any of three major mechanisms: arterial infarction/ischemia, hemorrhage, or venous thrombosis. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with a marked increase in the relative risk (RR) and a small increase in the absolute risk of stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk factors for stroke related to pregnancy include cesarean delivery, pregnancy-induced hypertension, postpartum infection, and possibly multiple gestations. In addition, conditions unique to pregnancy can occur, which can present as either a stroke or a stroke-like event. These include eclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, peripartum angiopathy, and gestational trophoblastic disease. Of these, preeclampsia/eclampsia is the most common cause of stroke in pregnancy. Other causes are listed in the table  (

         Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system typically characterized by relapses and remissions of neurologic deficits. MS affects women more than men by a ratio of approximately 2:1; the mean age of onset of MS is approximately 30 years. (See

         Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) refers to paresthesias, hypesthesia, pain, or numbness of the thumb, index, and middle fingers as a result of compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Affected patients often awake with burning, numbness, and tingling in the median nerve distribution, which is bilateral in 75 percent of cases. Patients commonly report shaking the hand to relieve the discomfort. The diagnosis is based upon presence of characteristic symptoms and objective findings and is similar to that in nonpregnant individuals. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5288.html" rel="external">
          "Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         CTS is relatively common during pregnancy, with an incidence of 2 to 35 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In one large series, pregnancy accounted for 7 percent of cases of CTS in women between the ages of 15 and 44 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The increased prevalence in pregnant women is thought to be caused by pregnancy-related fluid retention leading to compression of the nerve in the carpal tunnel; hormonal changes affecting the musculoskeletal system may also play a role. This was demonstrated by a study of 76 pregnant women with symptoms suggestive of CTS: 43 percent had abnormal nerve conduction studies of their carpal tunnel, and these women were more likely to have edema than women with normal studies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms tend to occur during the last trimester but can occur at any time [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,5
         </a>
         ]. In most cases, they gradually resolve over a period of weeks to months after delivery; however, symptoms can be prolonged for several months in women who are breastfeeding [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In one series of 37 women followed prospectively from near term to approximately 12 months after delivery, symptoms remained in 46 percent and were more common in women with early onset of disease [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Symptoms may recur in subsequent pregnancies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients may receive benefit from splinting the wrist at night in a neutral position or slight extension. Wrist splints may need to be worn throughout the day in severe cases. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Corticosteroid injection or surgery to release the flexor retinaculum is rarely indicated during pregnancy since the disease has a better prognosis than idiopathic CTS and often resolves postpartum. In a prospective case-control study of 45 pregnant women with CTS and 90 controls (age-matched women with idiopathic CTS) who were followed for three years, the pregnancy cohort was significantly more likely to show improvement in severity and function scores (68 and 73 percent, respectively) than the control cohort (42 and 39 percent) [

          Bell's palsy

          —
         </span>
         Bell's palsy is defined as a paralysis of the facial nerve, typically involving all three peripheral branches, resulting in asymmetric facial expression and unilateral weakness of eye closure. There is a two- to fourfold increase in prevalence during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester or in the first postpartum week [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. The cause for this increased risk of Bell's palsy in pregnancy is unclear, in part because the mechanism underlying Bell's palsy is uncertain. Perineural edema, hypercoagulability causing thrombosis of the vasa nervosum, and relative immunosuppression in pregnancy have been proposed as potential etiologic factors [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. One study found an association of Bell's palsy in pregnancy with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Bell’s palsy are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5281.html" rel="external">
          "Bell's palsy: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Recovery of facial paresis appears slightly worse in women who develop the disease during pregnancy. A retrospective study of 77 women with pregnancy-related Bell's palsy compared recovery outcome in pregnant women with that of nonpregnant women and men [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. All patients in all groups with incomplete paralysis ultimately recovered satisfactory function. However, more pregnant woman developed complete paralysis (65 versus 50 percent for nonpregnant and male patients). Pregnant women (as well as nonpregnant patients) with complete paralysis are less likely to recover satisfactory function than the other groups (52 versus 77 to 88 percent). The fact that pregnant women are less likely to receive treatment may also contribute to an apparent poorer prognosis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,15
         </a>
         ]. It is not clear whether the risk of recurrence is higher in pregnant versus nonpregnant women. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5286.html" rel="external">
          "Bell's palsy: Treatment and prognosis in adults"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment recommendations for Bell's palsy during pregnancy are the same as for nonpregnant patients, and are discussed separately (see

         Meralgia paresthetica is a sensory neuropathy that occurs when the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is compressed as it penetrates the tensor fascia lata at the inguinal ligament. Symptoms include dysesthesias in the upper and middle part of the lateral thigh and are probably caused by the expanding abdominal wall and increased lumbar lordosis. Symptoms occur late in pregnancy, typically resolve within three months postpartum, and rarely require treatment. (See

         </span>
         The Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute monophasic illness causing a rapidly progressive polyneuropathy with weakness or paralysis. GBS is thought to result from an immune response to a preceding infection that cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of molecular mimicry. The immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve, resulting in demyelinating and axonal forms of GBS. It typically begins within 30 days of an infection. A small percentage of patients develop GBS after another triggering event such as immunization, surgery, or trauma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5137.html" rel="external">
          "Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The cardinal clinical features of GBS are progressive, mostly symmetric muscle weakness and absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. Severe respiratory muscle weakness necessitating ventilatory support develops in approximately 30 percent, and dysautonomia occurs in 70 percent of patients. GBS usually progresses over a period of approximately two weeks, followed by a plateau phase of two to four weeks, and then gradual recovery of function. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5137.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         GBS does not appear to occur with increased frequency during pregnancy nor has uncomplicated disease been shown to affect pregnancy, labor, or delivery [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. However, the incidence of GBS may be increased in the postpartum period [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. There is one case report of congenital GBS in the neonate of an affected mother [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The main modalities of therapy for GBS are plasma exchange and administration of intravenous
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">
          immune globulin
         </a>
         (IVIG). These treatments hasten recovery from GBS, as shown in randomized controlled trials. However, neither treatment has been studied specifically in pregnant women with GBS. Aggressive fluid loading prior to plasma exchange may help to avoid hypotension. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5172.html" rel="external">
          "Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis", section on 'Immunomodulatory therapy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Maternal GBS is not an indication for cesarean delivery, which should be reserved for the usual obstetric indications only. Consultation with the anesthesia service is important, as these patients have some additional anesthetic issues (eg, need to avoid
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/z/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">
          succinylcholine

         , concerns about exacerbation of neurologic deficit, autonomic instability) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Supportive care is extremely important since up to 30 percent of patients with GBS develop neuromuscular respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In addition, autonomic dysfunction may be severe enough to require intensive care unit monitoring. Thus, many patients with GBS are initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of respiratory, cardiac, and hemodynamic function. Less severely affected patients can be managed in intermediate care units. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, bladder and bowel care, physical and occupational therapy, and psychological support are essential. Adequate pain control is necessary. (See

         Hereditary neuropathies that can affect women of childbearing age include hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN), also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, and Friedreich ataxia.
        </p>
        <p>
         CMT disease is a spectrum of disorders caused by a specific mutation in one of several myelin genes that result in defects in myelin structure, maintenance, and formation. Affected individuals show progressive distal limb atrophy and weakness, often with gait disturbance and deformity of feet and hands (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6220.html" rel="external">
          "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         ). An observational study including 108 births to mothers with CMT reported these patients had more operative deliveries, malpresentations, and postpartum bleeding than the general obstetric population [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Gestational age at birth and birth weights were comparable to those in unaffected pregnancies. It was not clear whether the increased prevalence of malpresentation was related to fetal disease, although the disorder typically does not present until later in childhood. Postpartum bleeding from atony may have been related to the effect of the disease on uterine adrenergic nerves.

        <p>
         Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease affecting the cerebellum, peripheral nerves, and the heart (see

         The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve does not contain motor fibers; thus, neurologic symptoms are restricted to sensory changes. Lateral hip pain accompanied by paresthesias (burning pain) or hypesthesias (numbness and tingling) over the upper outer thigh is the classic presentation of compression of this nerve. (See

         Factors that appear to predispose pregnant women to neuropathy postpartum include fetal macrosomia or malpresentation, sensory blockade (can impair recognition of discomfort), prolonged lithotomy position, prolonged second stage, and improper use of leg stirrups and retractors. However, many of these factors are interdependent (eg, prolonged lithotomy position and prolonged second stage). The prognosis for complete recovery is excellent; however, weakness may persist for several weeks or, rarely, months.

Low-grade and high-grade gliomas and meningiomas each represent approximately one-third of cases.

         A potential problem can occur in patients with brain tumors during the second stage of labor. Increased cerebrospinal fluid pressures have been observed in normal women during painful uterine contractions [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. This could potentially lead to neurologic compromise in a woman who already has a baseline elevation in intracranial pressure. Thus, careful consideration should be given to the type of delivery. Depending upon the location and size of the mass, a cesarean delivery under general anesthesia may be warranted [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         Pregnancy also promotes the growth of lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas). Neurologic symptoms most often develop in patients with macroadenomas (13 to 36 percent) but also occur in a few patients (less than 2 percent) with microadenomas (defined as less than 10 mm in diameter). Pregnant women with known pituitary adenomas may present with new-onset headache or visual changes that can be difficult to differentiate from migraines and other headache disorders. MRI can be used when necessary during all trimesters of pregnancy to rule out growth of the adenoma or pituitary apoplexy from ischemia or hemorrhage [

         Shunt malfunction complicates up to 25 to 50 percent of pregnancies in women with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ]. Functional occlusion of the shunt most often occurs in the third trimester. The rise in intra-abdominal pressure caused by the enlarging uterus may exceed the pressure within the peritoneal catheter, resulting in the cessation of cerebrospinal fluid drainage with a subsequent elevation in intracranial pressure [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Symptoms include confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, headache, nystagmus, and cranial nerve palsies. These symptoms require urgent evaluation, neuroimaging, and neurosurgical consultation.

         Preconception counseling should include description of the risks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for establishing baseline ventricular size and to verify adequate shunt function.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there are no controlled studies examining the best method of delivery for pregnant women with VP shunts, there seems to be agreement that vaginal delivery can be attempted [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38-40

        </p>
        <p>
         Caesarean delivery is recommended for neurologically unstable patients and those with obstetric indications for surgical delivery. Care should be taken to avoid dislodging or manipulating the abdominal tip of the shunt while the peritoneal cavity is open. Both regional and general anesthesia can be used in pregnant women with VP shunts [

         A significant proportion of spinal cord injuries occur in women of reproductive age [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

        <p>
         Common complications of spinal cord injury include anemia (from iron deficiency, folate deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, and chronic renal insufficiency), urinary tract infection, decubitus ulcers, and respiratory problems. Serial urinary tract cultures or antibiotic suppression is recommended to avoid upper urinary tract infection and its associated morbidity [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. Thermoregulation is impaired so that hypothermia can occur from cutaneous vasodilation and inability to shiver, while hyperthermia results from impairment of the normal sweating mechanism. Due to the tendency to spasticity and contractures, muscle-strengthening exercises for the upper extremities may be recommended for appropriate patients; range-of-motion exercises may be useful in others [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43

         Baseline pulmonary function studies should be performed in those who are contemplating pregnancy, and pulmonary function should be reassessed serially during pregnancy to identify women who might need ventilatory assistance in labor. (See

         Vaginal delivery is permissible. The ability to perceive labor pain is dependent upon the level of the injury. Women with cord injuries below T11 will be able to perceive labor pain, while those with lesions at T5 to T10 may have painless labors and deliveries. Such women should be monitored to avoid an unattended delivery from undetected labor. They may suspect labor from other clues such as spasticity and flexor spasm. They should also be taught uterine palpation to help detect contractions, and use of a home uterine monitor, weekly cervical examinations, and liberal hospitalization can be considered near term. Although some others have observed a higher frequency of preterm labor, most series report rates similar to that in the general obstetric population.
        </p>
        <p>
         These precautions may be particularly important for women with lesions above T5-6 level for the following reasons [

         Eighty-five percent develop autonomic dysreflexia during labor. The disorder can be precipitated by distension or irritation of the cervix, vagina, bowel, or bladder  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51824" href="/z/d/graphic/51824.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The manifestations of this potentially life-threatening syndrome result from sympathetic hyperactivity below the level of the lesion, since this portion of the spinal cord has been isolated from hypothalamic control. Symptoms include malignant hypertension (which may be confused with preeclampsia), loss of consciousness, headache, nasal congestion, facial erythema, sweating, piloerection, bradycardia or tachycardia, and arrhythmia. Uteroplacental vasoconstriction may develop, leading to fetal hypoxia. The symptoms are exacerbated by contractions and wane between contractions. Continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythm and blood pressure are warranted, as cerebrovascular accidents, intraventricular hemorrhage, or myocardial infarction may occur. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4839.html" rel="external">

         Epidural anesthesia extending to the T10 level should be used to prevent these manifestations, even if the patient does not perceive pain; antepartum consultation with an anesthesiologist is important [

         An indwelling Foley catheter will prevent bladder distention, and a bowel regimen is useful to prevent bowel distention from constipation [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has not yet received anesthesia and is supine, having her sit up leads to pooling of blood in the lower extremities and may reduce blood pressure. Antihypertensive medications (such as intravenous

For this reason, they may be very sensitive to medications that inhibit the function of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors). If severe hypertension persists despite anesthesia and intravenous antihypertensive medications,
