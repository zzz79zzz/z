(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/528.html" rel="external">"Acute exacerbations of asthma in adults: Home and office management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/119093.html" rel="external">"Acute exacerbations of asthma in adults: Emergency department and inpatient management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2020818384"><span class="h1">ADVICE RELATED TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified asthma as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], although supporting evidence remains mixed, with data largely from studies in adults [<a href="#rid2">2-13</a>]. Several studies that included patients with well-controlled asthma did not indicate increased risk in this population [<a href="#rid2">2-9</a>]. In addition, contrary to that expected for a viral respiratory infection, initial data suggested that COVID-19 did not increase asthma morbidity in children [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>]. However, other investigations of COVID-19 outcomes have reported increased risk, including a large meta-analysis of over 100,000 patients that reported higher rates of intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation in adults with asthma [<a href="#rid3">3,10-12</a>]. A comparison of nearly 62,000 children with asthma from 108 health care systems in the United States from March 2020 through February 2021 found that a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive test was associated with increased rates of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and use of short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) and oral glucocorticoids in the six months following the positive test compared with those who tested negative [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. These complications probably occur more frequently in those with poorly controlled asthma at baseline. Thus, patients with asthma should continue all regular medications necessary to maintain optimal asthma control, including inhaled glucocorticoids, oral glucocorticoids, and/or biologic agents (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12905" href="/d/drug information/12905.html" rel="external">omalizumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="120255" href="/d/drug information/120255.html" rel="external">dupilumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="108766" href="/d/drug information/108766.html" rel="external">mepolizumab</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127488.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128389.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Management in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5650363"><span class="h1">HOME MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4197404923"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Instructions regarding at-home monitoring and administration of medications for an acute asthma exacerbation differ depending upon the patient's history (eg, medications currently used to treat asthma, prior history of severe exacerbations, and prior experience with oral glucocorticoids) and the ability of the caregiver(s) to understand and follow the management plan. Patients with an uncomplicated asthma exacerbation often can be managed at home. However, home management is not meant to replace supervised medical care in patients with severe exacerbations. In addition, even children with mild asthma can have severe exacerbations [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Suggested treatment regimens are primarily based upon the clinical experience of experts, as well as data extrapolated from studies performed in the emergency department (ED). The caregiver(s) and patient should receive instruction on management of exacerbations, including medications and how and when to contact a clinician. These instructions should be summarized in an asthma action plan. The approach outlined below includes the steps that both the caregiver and clinician should take. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5740.html" rel="external">"Acute asthma exacerbations in children younger than 12 years: Emergency department management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3469689359"><span class="h2">Asthma action plan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An individualized written <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlbi.nih.gov%2Fresources%2Fasthma-action-plan-2020&amp;token=NbVaTGtxQubNH6cOHdPGYiClrc9to%2Bn496F37zDge9XAjtKYIqvyYtXWLbDMn5Qe%2Bm2f1uYo6%2FVPgqvEExtHHK8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=91328" target="_blank">asthma action plan</a> that is based upon symptoms should be provided to patients and their caregiver(s) to provide clear instructions on how to detect and respond to changes in symptoms. The asthma action plan should include clear instructions about how to reach a clinician during exacerbations. Some asthma action plans include peak flow monitoring, which is an optional adjunct to clinical assessment that is most useful when a personal best baseline has recently been established using the same device. Peak flow monitoring is not used universally, because the results are effort dependent and may not accurately reflect the maximal flow. In addition, results from a systematic review suggest that symptom-based asthma action plans are superior to peak flow-based plans in reducing the need for acute care visits in children and adolescents [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Patients who use peak flow monitoring regularly are the most likely to gain useful information when using peak flow measurements in the acute setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/566.html" rel="external">"Asthma education and self-management", section on 'Asthma action plans'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5650436"><span class="h2">Detecting the onset of an exacerbation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients or their caregivers are very sensitive to increased asthma symptoms (eg, cough, breathlessness), while others notice or perceive reduced airflow only when it becomes marked. Parents/caregivers should be taught to monitor for manifestations of an exacerbation, such as a persistent cough, increased respiratory rate, retractions, wheezing, or inability to speak in full sentences, particularly in the setting of an upper respiratory infection or exposure to a known asthma trigger for the child.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1030228529"><span class="h2">Need for urgent medical attention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with an acute asthma exacerbation who are at high risk for a life-threatening or fatal attack based upon history  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119887" href="/d/graphic/119887.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and/or who have acute signs and symptoms indicative of a severe exacerbation (eg, marked breathlessness, inability to speak more than short phrases, use of accessory muscles, and drowsiness) require immediate medical attention in the ED  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881" href="/d/graphic/93881.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). It is helpful to identify high-risk patients and to educate their caregiver(s) about identifying early warning signs of deterioration, following an oral glucocorticoid-based action plan, and calling emergency services promptly for ambulance transport to the ED while initiating treatment. (See <a class="local">'Patients with severe symptoms or at high risk for fatal asthma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Criteria for referral to the emergency department'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5650442"><span class="h2">Initial treatment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3707428327"><span class="h3">All patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When patients/caregivers recognize the onset of an exacerbation, they should administer the patient's quick-relief medication  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881" href="/d/graphic/93881.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). This is typically an inhaled short-acting beta agonist (SABA; eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13290" href="/d/drug information/13290.html" rel="external">albuterol</a> [salbutamol], <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12546" href="/d/drug information/12546.html" rel="external">levalbuterol</a> [levosalbutamol]) via metered dose inhaler with spacer (MDI-S; a valved holding chamber [VHC] is preferred) or nebulizer. The usual home dose is 2 to 4 puffs of albuterol (salbutamol) or nebulization solution dose of 1.25 to 2.5 mg for children &lt;4 years old and 2.5 to 5 mg if 4 to 11 years old if a SABA is used, or 1 puff of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12959" href="/d/drug information/12959.html" rel="external">budesonide-formoterol</a> (maximum dose 8 puffs/day) if that treatment is used  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134102" href="/d/graphic/134102.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The higher dose of SABA typically is used in children showing obvious signs of respiratory distress  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76344" href="/d/graphic/76344.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Beta agonists are the standard emergency treatment for acute asthma exacerbations in all patients based upon adult data, a few early trials in the ED setting in children, and many ensuing years of clinical use. Use of beta agonists for acute symptoms and exacerbations is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5743.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Quick-relief (rescue) treatment for acute symptoms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5740.html" rel="external">"Acute asthma exacerbations in children younger than 12 years: Emergency department management", section on 'Inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to use, the caregiver should confirm that the medication is not expired and, if using an MDI, confirm that the inhaler is not empty. If the medication is expired or the inhaler is empty, the caregiver should contact the child's clinician immediately to determine whether the child should be seen in the office or ED. The MDI should be primed before use, if necessary, based upon the manufacturer's recommendations in the package insert; these instructions vary from inhaler to inhaler. Each puff should be administered separately. Actuating the inhaler into the spacer more than once before inhaling does not work as well, because the medication is more likely to stick to the walls of the chamber, resulting in less medication available for inhalation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5737.html" rel="external">"Delivery of inhaled medication in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5738.html" rel="external">"The use of inhaler devices in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5736.html" rel="external">"Use of medication nebulizers in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3684845652"><span class="h3">Patients with severe symptoms or at high risk for fatal asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with severe symptoms (eg, marked breathlessness, inability to speak more than short phrases, use of accessory muscles, and agitation or drowsiness)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76344" href="/d/graphic/76344.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) require immediate treatment and medical attention  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881" href="/d/graphic/93881.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The caregiver should be instructed to call for ambulance transport to the ED while initiating the patient's quick-relief medication. For these patients, we also recommend initiating oral glucocorticoids as soon as possible, preferably in consultation with the patient's clinician. We also suggest administering oral glucocorticoids after initial beta agonist treatment for patients who have mild-to-moderate symptoms but are at high risk for fatal asthma  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119887" href="/d/graphic/119887.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These patients also require medical attention in the ED after initial treatment. Use of oral glucocorticoids for acute exacerbations is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5740.html" rel="external">"Acute asthma exacerbations in children younger than 12 years: Emergency department management", section on 'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> and <a class="local">'Incomplete response'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2568911907"><span class="h2">Reassessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The child's symptoms should then be reassessed by the caregiver in 10 to 20 minutes. The dose of inhaled beta agonist can be repeated 20 minutes after initiation of the first dose, if needed. Based upon the initial response to the inhaled beta agonist, the patient should either continue self-care or seek medical attention, as described below and in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881" href="/d/graphic/93881.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5743.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Quick-relief (rescue) treatment for acute symptoms"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1336187979"><span class="h2">Triage based upon response to initial home treatment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5650448"><span class="h3">Good response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If symptoms such as wheezing and dyspnea resolve and peak flow measurements improve, if following, after one to two beta agonist treatments and do not return within four hours, then the patient may safely continue at-home treatment with a SABA given every four to six hours as needed  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881" href="/d/graphic/93881.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Oral glucocorticoids are not routinely given to patients who respond to beta agonist treatment at home. Another important early intervention is removal of or from the offending stimulus (eg, animal dander, tobacco smoke), if known and possible. The caregiver should initiate contact with the child's clinician for instructions about how to continue care.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5650454"><span class="h3">Incomplete response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with an incomplete response with mild symptoms after two beta agonist treatments given 20 minutes apart (particularly if the higher dose of 4 puffs of an MDI or 2.5 or 5 mg via nebulizer was given) should contact their clinician urgently for advice regarding further treatment and whether they should be seen in the office or ED. A third dose of beta agonist can be given while the clinician is determining disposition. For patients who have oral glucocorticoids available at home as part of their asthma action plan, we suggest initiating oral glucocorticoids at home rather than waiting for administration in the office or ED  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93881" href="/d/graphic/93881.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Timely administration of oral glucocorticoids for serious asthma exacerbations is probably the single most effective strategy for reducing hospitalizations for acute asthma exacerbations and relapses after ED visits [<a href="#rid23">23-27</a>]. Oral glucocorticoids are also routinely used in the home setting for asthma exacerbations that do not respond quickly to beta agonist treatment even though the efficacy data are primarily derived from ED studies and patient- or caregiver-initiated use has not been studied in randomized trials [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Use of oral glucocorticoids for acute exacerbations is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5740.html" rel="external">"Acute asthma exacerbations in children younger than 12 years: Emergency department management", section on 'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>Other early interventions include removal of or from the offending stimulus (if known) and continued administration of inhaled beta agonists (up to every two hours for six to eight hours after giving oral glucocorticoids).</p><p>Several additional interventions have been studied but typically are not used. The available evidence, largely from ED management of asthma, indicates that inhaled glucocorticoids are not as effective as systemic glucocorticoid therapy for reducing the severity or preventing the progression of exacerbations in children [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Increasing the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids in patients already on this therapy daily is also not as effective as systemic glucocorticoids [<a href="#rid26">26,30-33</a>].
