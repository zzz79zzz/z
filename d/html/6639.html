         The diagnosis of hypopituitarism, defined as deficient secretion of one or more pituitary hormones because of pituitary or hypothalamic disease, is made by documenting subnormal secretion of these pituitary hormones in defined circumstances. Each pituitary hormone must be tested separately since there is a variable pattern of hormone deficiency among patients with hypopituitarism. Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism will be discussed here. The causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment of hypopituitarism are reviewed separately. (See

         The impetus to measure pituitary hormones is the suspicion that the secretion of one or more may be subnormal [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. This suspicion can be based upon the knowledge that the patient has either a lesion known to cause hypopituitarism or a symptom known to be caused by hypopituitarism. The knowledge that the patient has a lesion that can cause hypopituitarism, eg, a sellar mass, is by itself sufficient reason to test for hypopituitarism because some patients with hypopituitarism have no symptoms.

         For normal health, the basal secretion of corticotropin (ACTH) must be sufficient to maintain the serum cortisol concentration within the normal range. For survival, it must increase to raise serum cortisol concentrations in times of physical stress.

         </strong>
         value of ≤3 mcg/dL (83 nmol/L, normal range 5 to 25 mcg/dL [138 to 690 nmol/L]), confirmed by a second determination, is strong evidence of cortisol deficiency, which in a patient with a disorder known to cause hypopituitarism is usually the result of that disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Such a finding in the absence of any known cause of hypopituitarism mandates measurement of serum ACTH. A serum ACTH value not higher than normal is inappropriately low and establishes the diagnosis of secondary adrenal deficiency (ie, pituitary or hypothalamic disease). A value higher than normal documents primary adrenal insufficiency (ie, adrenal disease). (See

         As noted, there is disagreement among experts on the best approach to evaluating ACTH reserve in patients with an indeterminate morning serum cortisol. While the author of this topic uses the
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10156" href="/z/d/drug information/10156.html" rel="external">
          metyrapone
         </a>
         test, Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines and many experts suggest the cosyntropin stimulation test when a morning serum cortisol is indeterminate [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,4
         </a>
         ]. The major advantages of the cosyntropin test over the metyrapone test are drug availability and ease of administration.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for the administration of cosyntropin (ACTH) is that the adrenal glands atrophy when they have not been stimulated for a prolonged period; as a result, they do not secrete cortisol normally in response to a bolus dose of ACTH. The test is usually performed by administering 0.25 mg (25 units) of cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH 1-24) intramuscularly or intravenously and measuring serum cortisol 60 minutes later. A serum cortisol concentration of ≥18 mcg/dL (497 nmol/L) is considered a normal response. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/157.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Recent ACTH deficiency'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In practice, this test may be less useful because a patient who has such severe ACTH deficiency that the adrenal glands do not respond normally to cosyntropin will also probably have an 8 to 9 AM basal serum cortisol value that is ≤3 mcg/dL (83 nmol/L) and therefore will not need a test of ACTH reserve. On the other hand, a patient who has partial ACTH deficiency may have falsely normal results [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>

          Metyrapone
         </a>
         testing is particularly useful for patients with recent ACTH deficiency (eg, post transsphenoidal surgery). The rationale for the administration of metyrapone is that it blocks 11-beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, resulting in a reduction in cortisol secretion (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56413" href="/z/d/graphic/56413.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The ensuing fall in serum cortisol should, if the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is normal, cause an increase in ACTH secretion and therefore an increase in adrenal steroidogenesis up to and including 11-deoxycortisol.

         test requires adequate inhibition of cortisol production. If the serum 11-deoxycortisol concentration at the end of 24 hours is &lt;10 mcg/dL (289 nmol/L) but the serum cortisol concentration is ≥7 mcg/dL (193 nmol/L), the reason for the insufficient rise in 11-deoxycortisol may be insufficient inhibition by metyrapone. In this case, reasons for insufficient inhibition should be sought, such as failure to take all of the metyrapone, rapid metabolism, and malabsorption. The test should then be repeated using a double dose of metyrapone. (See

         test are that it can be administered to adults of any age and the results correlate reasonably well with the serum cortisol response to surgical stress. The principal disadvantage is that the patient must be observed in an inpatient setting so that blood pressure and pulse can be measured lying and standing before each four-hourly dose for 24 hours. If postural hypotension occurs, the test should be terminated by administration of 100 mg of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">

         A shorter version of this test involves the administration of a single 750 mg dose of

         The rationale for this test is that hypoglycemia induced by insulin administration is a sufficient stress to stimulate ACTH and therefore cortisol secretion. The test is performed by administering 0.1 unit of insulin per kg of body weight and measuring serum glucose and cortisol before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>

        <p>
         The advantage of this test is that the results also correlate relatively well with the serum cortisol response to surgical stress. The disadvantages are that hypoglycemia can be dangerous in older adult patients and those with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or a seizure disorder and that constant monitoring is required during the first hour after the administration of insulin. The monitoring is necessary to detect neuroglycopenic symptoms, which should be treated with intravenous glucose (see

         Hypothyroidism in patients who have pituitary or hypothalamic disease is the result of thyrotropin (TSH) deficiency and, therefore, unlike in patients who have thyroid disease, an elevated serum TSH concentration cannot be used to make the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The serum TSH concentration is usually not low either, except when the hypothyroidism is treated. Screening for hypothyroidism in patients with pituitary or hypothalamic disease is therefore performed by measuring thyroxine, either free T4 or total T4 and T3 uptake. (See

         In a male with hypopituitarism, luteinizing hormone (LH) deficiency can best be detected by measurement of the serum testosterone concentration. If it is repeatedly low at 8 to 10 AM and the LH concentration is not elevated, the patient has secondary hypogonadism. When the serum testosterone concentration is low, the serum LH concentration is usually within the normal range, but low compared with elevated values in primary hypogonadism. If fertility is an issue, the sperm count should be determined. (See

         In a female of premenopausal age who has pituitary or hypothalamic disease but normal menses, no tests of LH or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion are needed because a normal menstrual cycle is a more sensitive indicator of intact pituitary-gonadal function than any biochemical test. If the female has oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, serum LH or FSH should be measured to be sure it is not high due to ovarian disease. In addition, the following two tests should be obtained:

         A low serum estradiol concentration and/or absence of vaginal bleeding indicate estradiol deficiency as a consequence of gonadotropin deficiency and warrant consideration of estrogen treatment. Normal results, in association with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, could indicate sufficient gonadotropin secretion to maintain normal basal estradiol secretion but insufficient to cause ovulation and normal progesterone secretion. This situation should prompt consideration of intermittent progestin as one treatment option.

        <p>
         The serum LH response to a single bolus dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is not helpful in distinguishing secondary hypogonadism due to pituitary disease from that due to hypothalamic disease, as the response may be normal or subnormal in both groups.

         The main physiologic role of prolactin is for lactation. Females who have severe hypopituitarism due to hypothalamic or pituitary disease may, in the postpartum period, have a serum prolactin concentration that is inappropriately low and not be able to breastfeed.

         Pituitary function should be tested when a patient is found to have a disease that affects the hypothalamus or pituitary. Each pituitary hormone that the clinician thinks is clinically important to a patient needs to be tested separately. (See

         Corticotropin (ACTH) secretion is tested by measuring serum cortisol at 8 to 9 AM on two or more occasions; if the value is &lt;3 mcg/dL, the patient has cortisol deficiency, and if &gt;18 mcg/dL, the patient has cortisol sufficiency.

         To evaluate thyrotropin (TSH) secretion, we measure either free T4 or total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) uptake. The serum TSH concentration should not be used to make the diagnosis, because it is usually within the normal range, although sometimes low or even slightly high and, therefore, it is not helpful.

         Gonadotropin secretion in a man is tested by measuring the serum total testosterone concentration on two or more occasions at 8 to 10 AM. A low testosterone, assuming he is not obese (or free testosterone if he is obese), and luteinizing hormone (LH) that is not elevated indicate secondary hypogonadism. Gonadotropin secretion in a woman of premenopausal age who has amenorrhea is tested by measuring estradiol.
