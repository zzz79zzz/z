         Natural menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, determined retrospectively after a woman has experienced 12 months of amenorrhea without any other obvious pathologic or physiologic cause. It occurs at a median age of 51.4 years and is a reflection of complete, or near complete, ovarian follicular depletion, with resulting hypoestrogenemia and high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72948" href="/z/d/graphic/72948.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The menopausal transition (perimenopause) occurs after the reproductive years, but before menopause, and is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, endocrine changes, and symptoms such as hot flashes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The terms for natural menopause that occurs between the ages of 40 and 45 years or &lt;40 years are "early menopause" and "primary ovarian insufficiency," respectively. Both early menopause and primary ovarian insufficiency have been associated with an excess risk of cardiovascular disease, bone loss, and cognitive function concerns. This topic will review the clinical features and diagnosis of the menopausal transition and menopause and briefly review the criteria for primary ovarian insufficiency and early menopause. The clinical manifestations and health impact of elective bilateral oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy is reviewed separately. In addition, the physiology and epidemiology of menopause, postmenopausal hormone therapy, and primary ovarian insufficiency are reviewed separately:

         The menopausal transition (or perimenopause) begins, on average, four years before the final menstrual period (FMP) and includes a number of physiologic changes that may affect a woman's quality of life. It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and marked hormonal fluctuations, often accompanied by hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood symptoms, and vaginal dryness [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-6
         </a>
         ] (see
         <a class="local">
          'Symptoms'
         </a>
         below). In addition, changes in lipids and bone loss begin to occur, both of which have implications for long-term health.
        </p>
        <p>
         Virtually all women experience the menstrual irregularity and hormonal fluctuations prior to clinical menopause; up to 80 percent develop hot flashes (the most common menopausal symptom), but only 20 to 30 percent seek medical attention for them (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131983" href="/z/d/graphic/131983.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hot flashes'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Much of the available information about the endocrine and clinical manifestations of the menopausal transition comes from longitudinal cohort studies of midlife women [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-19
         </a>
         ], the largest of which, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), has followed a multiethnic, community-based cohort of over 3000 women ages 42 to 52 years for 15 years [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,12-14,16,17,20-29
         </a>
         ]. Based upon data from these cohort studies, a staging system was developed that is now considered to be the gold standard for characterizing reproductive aging from the reproductive years through menopause (

         </span>
         In the late reproductive years before the onset of the menopausal transition, serum inhibin B (a granulosa cell protein marker reflecting oocyte number) begins to decrease [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ], allowing the rise in serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) while estradiol levels are preserved. Luteal phase progesterone levels decrease as fertility potential begins to decline (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77945" href="/z/d/graphic/77945.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). Inhibin B is not typically measured to assess reproductive stage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Menstrual cycles are ovulatory, but the follicular phase (the first half of the menstrual cycle before ovulation occurs) begins to shorten (eg, 10 versus 14 days) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79769" href="/z/d/graphic/79769.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Women who are having difficulty conceiving often seek advice about their menopausal status during this stage. Although there is variability in age at any given stage of reproductive aging, women are typically in their 40s when cycles begin to shorten. (See

         As the process of ovarian follicular depletion continues in midlife (

         ), women eventually experience a change in intermenstrual interval. This change in bleeding pattern, which is accompanied by hormonal fluctuations and a variety of symptoms, is referred to as the menopausal transition, or perimenopause, and occurs on average at age 47 years [

         <strong>
          The early transition
         </strong>
         – The early transition is defined by a change of ≥7 days in the intermenstrual interval. Normal intermenstrual interval during the reproductive years is 25 to 35 days; during the menopausal transition, this may increase to 40 to 50 days or there may be a shortening of the intermenstrual interval, similar to that seen in the late reproductive years. Early follicular phase FSH levels, while variable, are typically high (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324" href="/z/d/graphic/82324.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). This initial stage of the menopausal transition is referred to as the "early transition" in the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging system, which is described below (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933" href="/z/d/graphic/82933.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          The late transition
         </strong>
         – After the initial lengthening of the intermenstrual interval, women progress to more dramatic menstrual cycle changes with skipped cycles, episodes of amenorrhea, and an increasing frequency of anovulatory cycles (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324" href="/z/d/graphic/82324.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). This stage is referred to as the "late transition" in the STRAW staging system and typically lasts for one to three years before the FMP (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933" href="/z/d/graphic/82933.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] (see
         <a class="local">
          'The STRAW staging system'
         </a>
         below). Of note, not all women follow a "typical" bleeding pattern. Some will have episodes of amenorrhea interspersed with short ovulatory cycles that resemble those of the late reproductive stage.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">

         <strong>
          Endocrine findings
         </strong>
         – The more irregular cycles are often accompanied by dramatic fluctuations in serum FSH and estradiol concentrations (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324" href="/z/d/graphic/82324.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). Consequently, a random serum sample may demonstrate high FSH and low estradiol concentrations consistent with menopause, but soon thereafter, FSH and estradiol may return to the normal premenopausal range (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324" href="/z/d/graphic/82324.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. One study reported that a random serum FSH &gt;25 international units/L is characteristic of the late menopausal transition [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], but measurements of serum FSH during the late menopausal transition are not routinely recommended, due to their variability and lack of predictability for menopausal onset or symptomatology. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Other endocrine changes across the menopausal transition include a progressive decrease in serum inhibin B, as well as a decrease in anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), another product of the ovary's granulosa cells. In addition, ovarian antral follicle count (AFC), defined as the remaining complement of follicles measuring 2 to 10 mm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasound, declines steadily across the reproductive years though postmenopause.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         AMH, AFC, and cycle day 3 FSH and estradiol have all been used to assess ovarian reserve in the setting of assisted reproductive techniques, but none are validated for the evaluation of menopausal status [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Inhibin B is typically measured during a diagnostic evaluation for ovarian tumors, but not for evaluation of menopause. (See

         <strong>
          Menstrual bleeding
         </strong>
         – In general, the transition is characterized by a gradual decrease in menstrual bleeding [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. However, some women experience heavy or prolonged bleeding, which has always been assumed to be due to anovulatory cycles and prolonged exposure of the endometrium to unopposed estrogen. However, in one report, the heaviest bleeding occurred in women in the late transition during ovulatory cycles, which were more likely than anovulatory cycles to be associated with high serum estradiol concentrations [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ] and, as noted above, a relative progesterone deficiency. Women with obesity and uterine fibroids are also more likely to experience heavy bleeding [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The evaluation and management of heavy (&gt;80 mL) and prolonged bleeding (&gt;7 days) is reviewed separately. (See

         After the years of menstrual irregularity, women eventually experience permanent cessation of menses or clinical menopause. The FMP is defined retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea. The first two to six years after the FMP are referred to as "early postmenopause" in the STRAW staging system and "late postmenopause" thereafter. (See

         Although the median age at natural menopause is 51.4 years, the timing of menopause is affected by a number of factors, including genetics, smoking, and reproductive history, which are reviewed separately. (See

Some women first develop hot flashes that cluster during the nadir of estradiol secretion that occurs in the late luteal and early follicular phases during their late reproductive years, but symptoms are typically mild and do not require treatment. Symptoms become far more common during the menopausal transition, with a frequency of approximately 40 percent in the early transition, increasing to 60 to 80 percent in the late menopausal transition and early postmenopausal periods (

         Hot flashes typically begin as the sudden sensation of heat centered on the upper chest and face that rapidly becomes generalized. The sensation of heat lasts from two to four minutes, is often associated with profuse perspiration and occasionally palpitations, and is sometimes followed by chills and shivering, and a feeling of anxiety. Hot flashes usually occur several times per day, although the range may be from only one or two each day to as many as one per hour during the day and night. Hot flashes are particularly common at night. (See

         Hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms have a negative impact on work outcomes (absences, decreased hours, layoffs, firings, and job changes specifically due to menopause symptoms). In a survey study of 4440 menopausal women with moderate symptom scores based upon the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), 480 (11 percent) reported missing work in the preceding year (average of three days missed) [
         <a href="#rid51">

         A distressing feature of hot flashes is that they are more common at night than during the day and are associated with arousal from sleep. However, peri- and postmenopausal women experience sleep disturbances even in the absence of hot flashes [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>

         <a href="#rid43">
          43,60
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Anxiety and depression symptoms, which are common during the menopausal transition, may also contribute to sleep disturbances; in one study, they were predictive of subjective sleep disturbances [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. In addition, perimenopausal women with hot flashes are more likely to be depressed [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62,63
         </a>
         ]. (See

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Primary sleep disorders are also common in this population. In a report of 102 women ages 44 to 56 years who reported sleep disturbances, 54 (53 percent) had sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, or both [

        <p>
         Thus, in peri- or postmenopausal women who report sleep disturbances, treating the vasomotor symptoms may decrease sleep disturbances, but this may not resolve all sleep problems, as there are many other things that can disturb sleep, such as primary sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression [

         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. These apparent sex differences were attenuated in the postmenopausal years. Higher serum estradiol concentrations in women, a reflection of residual ovarian activity, were associated with better performance. Thus, some evidence suggests that in early midlife, women appear to outperform men on memory tasks, but with the onset of menopause and decline in serum estradiol, any memory advantage diminishes.

         Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), formerly referred to as vulvovaginal atrophy, is defined as a collection of symptoms and signs caused by hypoestrogenic changes to the labia, clitoris, vagina, urethra, and bladder that occur in menopausal women. In general, these symptoms develop later than other menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. Estrogen deficiency leads to a decrease in blood flow to the vagina and vulva. This decrease is a major cause of decreased vaginal lubrication and sexual dysfunction in menopausal women. Symptoms related to genitourinary atrophy are exquisitely responsive to estrogen therapy, in particular, vaginal estrogen therapy. (See

          Bone loss

          Cardiovascular disease
         </strong>
         – The risk of cardiovascular disease increases after menopause, thought to be at least in part due to estrogen deficiency. This may be mediated in part by changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as lipid profiles that begin to change during perimenopause. This was illustrated by longitudinal data from over 2500 subjects in the SWAN study [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. After adjusting for subject age, there was a small increase in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) during the menopausal transition (a 6 percent increase in mean LDL from 116 mg/dL in the premenopausal years to 123 mg/dL in the early postmenopausal years). There was no change in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL), but data from a later SWAN ancillary study suggested that the protective effect of HDL may decrease as women transition to menopause [

         – In the early postmenopausal years, women who do not take estrogen therapy typically gain fat mass and lose lean mass.

         In our experience, among women who present at midlife for evaluation of possible menopausal transition or menopause, many are interested in postmenopausal hormone therapy, while others simply want to know what to expect in the coming years: bleeding patterns, symptoms, or potential long-term consequences of estrogen deficiency (eg, osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, or dementia) (

         </span>
         As noted above, the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) staging system was developed based upon data from multiple longitudinal cohort studies [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. It is considered the gold standard for characterizing reproductive aging from the reproductive years through menopause and includes criteria for the reproductive years, the menopausal transition, final menstrual period (FMP), and postmenopause based upon bleeding patterns, endocrine findings, and symptoms (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933" href="/z/d/graphic/82933.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The menopausal transition and postmenopause are further subdivided into "early" and "late" stages.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the STRAW system has been used primarily for women's health research, it may also be helpful in the clinical setting for patients and clinicians to assess fertility potential, contraceptive needs, and potential need for hormone therapy. We find the bleeding and symptom criteria of STRAW to be useful when counseling patients about what to anticipate in the coming years (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933" href="/z/d/graphic/82933.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, the STRAW staging criteria are not considered to represent diagnostic criteria for the menopausal transition or menopause, primarily because they include endocrine data (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], inhibin B, anti-müllerian hormone [AMH]) and pelvic ultrasound (antral follicle count [AFC]) as supportive criteria when determining reproductive stage. All four criteria have been used to assess ovarian reserve in the setting of assisted reproductive technologies, but none have been validated for use in the evaluation of menopausal status. (See

         The evaluation depends on the patient's age (&lt;40 years, 40 to 45 years, or over 45 years). For women of all ages, we start with an assessment of the woman's menstrual cycle history (ideally with a menstrual calendar) and a detailed history of any menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, sleep disturbances, depression, vaginal dryness). All women with symptoms of vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, or sexual dysfunction should have a pelvic examination to evaluate for vaginal atrophy.

         Although the menopausal transition begins, on average, at age 47 years [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ], the age at onset of the menopausal transition is variable, and women over age 45 years who present with characteristic menopausal signs and symptoms are more likely to be in the menopausal transition than to have a new endocrine disorder. Therefore, for women over age 45 years who present with irregular menstrual cycles with menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood changes, or sleep disturbance, we suggest no further diagnostic evaluation, as they are highly likely to be in the menopausal transition (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131983" href="/z/d/graphic/131983.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Although serum FSH is often measured, it is not necessary to make the diagnosis and, if normal, may be misleading. In the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) longitudinal cohort study described above, changes in menstrual bleeding patterns were a better predictor of menopausal stage or FMP than serum FSH concentrations [
         <a href="#rid29">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Serum FSH concentrations vary widely during the menopausal transition, so a value in the normal premenopausal range does not rule out perimenopause as the cause of symptoms (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131983" href="/z/d/graphic/131983.html" rel="external">

         <a class="local">
          'Menopausal transition'

         above). A random serum sample may demonstrate high FSH and low estradiol concentrations consistent with menopause, or normal values in the premenopausal range (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324" href="/z/d/graphic/82324.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         The possibility of pregnancy must always be considered in amenorrheic women, and a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) should be drawn in sexually active women who are not using reliable contraception.

         Women in this age group with a change in intermenstrual interval and menopausal symptoms should not be diagnosed with either the menopausal transition or menopause. They have primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure). The biology and natural history are different and are reviewed separately. (See

         The diagnosis of menopausal transition is more difficult, and the STRAW staging system does not apply to women with underlying menstrual disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or hypothalamic amenorrhea. Little information is available about menstrual cycle and endocrine changes in either disorder, but some data suggest that women with PCOS may develop more regular cycles in their later reproductive years, for reasons that are unclear [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74,75

         ]. For women with either diagnosis who develop menopausal symptoms, we suggest measuring FSH concentration for diagnostic purposes.

         Oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives are considered to be safe in nonsmokers up to the age of menopause (average age 50 to 51 years) [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ]. Women taking them want reassurance that they are postmenopausal before stopping. However, it is difficult to determine if menopause has occurred because these women do not develop the irregular bleeding or vasomotor symptoms that are typical of the menopausal transition. In addition, because their hypothalamic-pituitary axis is suppressed by the high dose of exogenous estrogen, measurement of the serum FSH level is unreliable. Some clinicians measure serum FSH concentration on the day 7 of the pill-free interval, but we do not suggest this approach, because FSH is typically still suppressed and in the premenopausal range.
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest stopping the pill and measuring serum FSH two to four weeks later. A level ≥25 international units/L indicates that the patient has likely entered the menopausal transition. However, there is no FSH value that would provide absolute reassurance that a patient is postmenopausal. We typically stop the pill by age 50 to 51 years, when the chance of conceiving is extremely low. If menopausal symptoms occur, the possibility of short-term menopausal hormone therapy for symptom relief can be discussed. (See

         Menopause in women who have undergone hysterectomy or endometrial ablation cannot be determined using menstrual bleeding criteria. Therefore, supportive criteria, including assessment of menopausal symptoms and biochemical data, are needed. In this setting, we suggest measurement of FSH concentrations (

         The menopausal transition (or perimenopause) begins, on average, four years before the final menstrual period (FMP) and is marked by irregular menstrual cycles, intense hormonal fluctuations, often accompanied by vasomotor complaints, sleep disturbances, and changes in sexual function.

         The late transition is characterized by more dramatic menstrual cycle changes and greater FSH and estradiol variability. Hot flashes are the most common symptom for women in the menopausal transition. They are most common in the late menopausal transition and early postmenopausal stage. Hot flashes are often associated with sleep disturbances. (See
