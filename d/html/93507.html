The most common cause of postoperative ocular injury is corneal abrasion, which may or may not be associated with visual loss. The most common causes of permanent POVL are central retinal artery occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, and cerebral vision loss.</p><p>POVL can occur after injury at any site in the visual pathway, from the cornea to the occipital lobe; the pathophysiology of POVL is often incompletely understood. Disability from POVL can range from transient blurring or loss of vision to devastating, permanent bilateral blindness.</p><p>This topic will discuss the types of postoperative visual disturbances, what is known about etiology, and recommendations for prevention and treatment as they relate to anesthesia care. Acute visual loss in other settings is discussed separately.

Data come largely from retrospective studies and case series.</p><p>Estimates of the rate of POVL by type of surgery from a large national database (published in 2009) were as follows [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appendectomy – 0.12 per 10,000</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laminectomy without fusion – 0.86 per 10,000</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Knee surgery – 1.08 per 10,000</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hip surgery – 1.86 per 10,000</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spinal fusion – 3.09 per 10,000 for all fusions, 0.66 per 10,000 with anterior approach only, 5.50 per 10,000 with posterior approach</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiac surgery – 8.64 per 10,000</p><p></p><p>Studies from single centers report low rates as well, with the following approximate rates [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All nonocular procedures – 5.4 per 10,000 for transient POVL and 0.16 per 10,000 for permanent POVL</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Noncardiac procedures – 4.3 per 10,000 patients for transient POVL and 0.08 per 10,000 patients for POVL lasting more than 30 days</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94404065"><span class="h1">URGENT EVALUATION OF VISUAL LOSS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any complaint of postoperative visual loss (POVL) should be taken seriously, rather than attributing symptoms to residual sedation or anesthesia. Some diagnoses such as corneal abrasions, require minimal treatment, while others are medical emergencies (eg, cerebral visual loss, central retinal artery occlusion, acute angle-closure glaucoma, retrobulbar hematoma), as complete and permanent vision loss may ensue within a few hours. Complaints of visual loss should prompt urgent ophthalmologic consultation so that an expeditious evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment plan can be developed to salvage as much vision as possible. The approach to the patient with visual loss is discussed more fully separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6902.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with acute persistent visual loss", section on 'Approach to the patient'</a>.)</p><p>For procedures associated with a high risk of POVL, such as cardiac procedures, prone spine surgery, head and neck procedures, and hip/femur surgery, we recommend a gross vision examination for each eye as soon as possible after emergence from anesthesia (eg, having the patient count fingers in each eye and assessing pupillary light reactions). Regardless of the type of surgical procedure, when a patient complains of postoperative visual changes, performance of a gross eye examination and obtaining a brief history will be helpful prior to consulting an ophthalmologist. Evaluation while waiting for ophthalmology consultation should include review of the following signs, symptoms, and historical features. Associated factors, clinical presentation, and indicated workup for various types of POVL are shown in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100340" href="/z/d/graphic/100340.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pain </strong>–<strong> </strong>Eye pain, especially with foreign body sensation, is suggestive of corneal abrasion. Eye pain can also occur with acute glaucoma and retrobulbar hematoma, which are ophthalmologic emergencies. Headache occurs in almost all cases of pituitary apoplexy and acute angle-closure glaucoma, and may occur with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). (See <a class="local">'Corneal abrasion'</a> below and <a class="local">'Acute angle-closure glaucoma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Retrobulbar hematoma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Erythema </strong>–<strong> </strong>Red eye often occurs with corneal abrasion and sometimes with acute angle-closure glaucoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Visual deficit</strong> – Complete loss of vision or a visual field deficit may occur with central retinal artery occlusion, anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, damage to the intracranial visual pathways, and retrobulbar hematoma, which may be unilateral or bilateral. In cases of pituitary apoplexy and PRES, the visual deficit may be similar or limited to blurred vision. Intermittent blurring of vision with halos may occur with acute angle-closure glaucoma. Transient blurred vision usually occurs with glycine-induced visual loss and may occur with corneal abrasion. (See <a class="local">'Postoperative ischemic optic neuropathy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Cerebral visual loss'</a> below and <a class="local">'Central retinal artery occlusion'</a> below and <a class="local">'Retrobulbar hematoma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Glycine-induced visual loss'</a> below and <a class="local">'Pituitary apoplexy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pupillary light reflexes </strong>–<strong> </strong>Unilateral central retinal artery occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, and retrobulbar hematoma result in a poor or absent pupillary response to light ("direct" response) with a normal response when light is directed to the other pupil ("indirect" response); this "relative afferent pupillary defect" is revealed when tested with the swinging flashlight maneuver; if these processes are bilateral, there will be poor or absent direct pupillary responses and a relative afferent pupillary defect only if asymmetric. Mid-dilated and nonreactive pupils are consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma, while sluggish to fixed and dilated pupils are seen with glycine-induced visual loss. Pupillary light reflexes are normal in cases of corneal abrasion, cerebral or cortical visual loss, and in cases of PRES. Examination of pupils is discussed more fully separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5095.html" rel="external">"The detailed neurologic examination in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Evaluation by the ophthalmologist typically includes a past medical history, perioperative events, ocular complaints and an eye examination with visual acuity, color vision, pupillary light reflex testing, visual field testing, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, and a dilated funduscopic examination unless acute glaucoma is suspected. Based on the findings, further diagnostic testing may include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and the orbits with attention to the visual pathways to screen for infarctions, hemorrhages, and pituitary apoplexy; visual evoked potentials to evaluate optic nerve and visual pathway function; and occasionally electroretinography if there is any concern about retinal function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H571003340"><span class="h1">MOST COMMON CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common causes of ocular complaints postoperatively are corneal abrasion, postoperative ischemic optic neuropathy, cerebral visual loss, and central retinal artery occlusion. Clinical features, associated factors, workup, and treatment of the various causes of postoperative visual loss (POVL) are shown in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100340" href="/z/d/graphic/100340.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94404077"><span class="h2">Corneal abrasion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common cause of postoperative visual complaints is corneal abrasion. Single-center studies have found an incidence ranging from 0.09 per 1000 [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] to 1 events per 1000 general anesthetics [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. Diagnosis and management of corneal abrasion are discussed more fully separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6897.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H571003443"><span class="h3">Etiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Possible etiologies in the perioperative period include corneal drying, with exposure of the cornea compounded by decreased tear production during general anesthesia, or direct trauma to unprotected eyes during airway management from monitoring equipment (eg, pulse oximetry probe, electrocardiogram cables), from loose tape over the eyes with incomplete lid closure, or from drapes or other materials near the face. In addition, corneal injury can occur when patients rub their eyes while still sedated after emergence from anesthesia.</p><p>In three single institution database studies and one study using a national database, the risk of corneal abrasion was higher in patients who underwent surgery in non-supine positions including lateral, prone, and steep Trendelenburg [<a href="#rid3">3,6-8</a>]. Increasing age [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>] and longer duration of surgery/anesthesia [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>] were also identified as risk factors, each in two of these studies. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H571003449"><span class="h3">Diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A presumptive diagnosis of corneal abrasion is often made postoperatively in a patient with eye pain, foreign body sensation, and photophobia. Visual acuity may be subnormal if the abrasion is in the visual axis but generally recovers quickly. Residual anesthetic, analgesics, and sedatives may alter patient symptoms, making diagnosis difficult. </p><p>A presumptive diagnosis may also be made by administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9824" href="/z/d/drug information/9824.html" rel="external">proparacaine</a> (topical ophthalmic local anesthetic). One study described an institutional protocol whereby the diagnosis of corneal abrasion was made by immediate relief of pain with topical ophthalmic proparacaine 0.5%, one drop in the affected eye, after ruling out a foreign body and ensuring that the pupillary light reflex was normal [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Ophthalmology was consulted if pain was not relieved in one minute; this occurred in 30 of 425 patients who received proparacaine. Such a protocol may be reasonable, especially for smaller hospitals in which ophthalmology consultation is not readily available. However, this protocol does not confirm a diagnosis of corneal abrasion, and pain relief with proparacaine will also occur in patients with dry cornea or a small foreign body causing irritation. If vision is disproportionately involved or pain is severe, a slit-lamp examination and further care by an ophthalmologist are preferable (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77817" href="/z/d/graphic/77817.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Mistaken diagnoses of corneal abrasions postoperatively have delayed treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma, which was urgently needed to prevent permanent loss of vision [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. One review of the literature on acute angle-closure glaucoma after anesthesia noted the onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis ranged from several hours to five days [<a href="#rid10">10</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6903.html" rel="external">"Angle-closure glaucoma", section on 'Acute primary angle-closure glaucoma'</a>). For patients diagnosed with corneal abrasion, lack of significant improvement in symptoms by the next day should prompt further consultation with ophthalmology to investigate other causes of visual loss. As an example, corneal abrasions may accompany other ocular injuries such as central retinal artery occlusion, which requires a dilated funduscopic examination for diagnosis.</p><p>Diagnosis of corneal abrasion is discussed more fully separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6897.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H571004073"><span class="h3">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of corneal abrasion usually consists of administration of topical antibiotics, with healing expected within 24 hours. Management of corneal abrasion is discussed more fully separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management"</a>.)</p><p>Some hospitals and anesthesiology departments have specific diagnostic and treatment protocols in place for presumptive corneal abrasions, which primarily consist of diagnosis with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/z/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">fluorescein</a> stain and cobalt blue light, or immediate relief of pain with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9824" href="/z/d/drug information/9824.html" rel="external">proparacaine</a> eye drops [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], and treatment with prophylactic antibiotic and lubricant drops for two to three days, with expected complete resolution in that time. Patients should not use local anesthetic for pain relief after discharge from the hospital. </p><p>Patients with significant visual loss or symptoms that suggest other causes of ocular injury are not appropriate for these protocols and should have an urgent ophthalmologic consult to investigate other causes of visual loss. For patients treated for presumed corneal abrasion, lack of significant improvement by the next day should also prompt an ophthalmology consultation (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100340" href="/z/d/graphic/100340.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90922.html" rel="external">"Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management", section on 'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H571003455"><span class="h3">Prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prevention of perioperative corneal abrasions includes prompt taping of eyelids after the patient is induced for general anesthesia, making sure that the lids are fully closed [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Use of lubricants, ointments, and gels prior to taping the eyes is controversial, as some studies have shown no additional benefit, while the gel and ointment may cause a foreign-body sensation in the eye and promote eye rubbing in the sedated postoperative state [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The anesthesia clinician should check the face frequently during surgery to make sure the eye covering is in place and that there is no pressure on the eyes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94404101"><span class="h2">Postoperative ischemic optic neuropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) is the most common cause of permanent POVL in adults after nonocular surgery. It is more common after cardiac, spine, and orthopedic procedures compared with abdominal surgery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], and it has been reported after bilateral radical neck procedures [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] and in cases performed in the steep Trendelenburg position, such as laparoscopic gynecologic and urologic procedures [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>National data from cardiac, spinal fusion, abdominal, and nonfusion orthopedic procedures demonstrate a twofold increased risk in men and a more than 1.5-fold risk for patients over the age of 50 years after multivariable analysis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Rates of ION vary among centers for the same category of procedures, possibly related to the invasiveness of procedures performed, specific practice patterns, or susceptibility of populations from different geographic regions. Retrospective reviews published in 1997 and 2005 from major tertiary care centers that perform extensive spinal reconstruction and revision procedures reported rates of ION ranging from 0.28 to 1.2 per 1000 spine surgeries [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In a 2016 study the incidence of ION had decreased to 1.02/10,000 in thoracic, lumbar, sacral spinal fusion [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Indeed, national estimates of perioperative ION are significantly lower and have decreased from 1.63/10,000 patients between the years 1998 and 2000 to 0.6/10,000 from 2010 to 2012 [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. This decrease occurred during the period when major research and education were focused on risk factors for ION associated with spinal fusion surgery.</p><p>In contrast, ION associated with cardiac surgery studied over a similar time period (1998 to 2013) using the same national database found no significant change over time with an average yearly incidence of 1.43 per 10,000 procedures [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Risk factors for cardiac surgery included male sex, carotid artery stenosis, and stroke, as well as many ocular diseases including hypertensive retinopathy, cataracts, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. Perioperative data on fluid administration, blood pressure, lowest hematocrit, use of vasopressors, and temporal association of ION with surgery are limited in this national database, making it difficult to ascertain periprocedural risk factors in this study.</p><p>ION may be arteritic (eg, giant cell arteritis) or non-arteritic. Postoperative ION is always nonarteritic and is of two types: anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), affecting the optic disc; and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION), which is retrobulbar or posterior to the lamina cribrosa. PION is believed to result from an infarction of the retrobulbar optic nerve and is distinguished clinically from AION by a normal-appearing optic nerve head in the first several weeks after surgery. It is unclear whether the risk factors for postoperative AION and PION differ for the same type of procedure in which the same physiologic perturbations occur, and there are no other discernible differences in patient characteristics or perioperative events. Ischemic optic neuropathy of both types is discussed more fully separately.

Despite the much higher rate of POVL in cardiac surgery, the majority of submissions of cases to the ASA POVL Registry were related to prone spinal fusion surgery. The most common diagnosis associated with POVL after spinal fusion surgery was ION, with approximately 23 percent AION, 67 percent PION, and the remainder unknown ION [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, a case control study compared 80 adult patients with ION from the ASA registry with 315 control patients to identify risk factors for ION after spine surgery [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The controls were patients who had similar surgical procedures but did not develop POVL. Independent risk factors identified after multivariate regression analysis included male sex; obesity; use of the Wilson frame (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100534" href="/z/d/graphic/100534.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), which keeps the head at a level lower than the heart; prolonged duration of procedure/anesthesia; and high estimated blood loss. Use of colloid fluids was found to be protective against the development of ION. This model accounted for approximately 80 percent of the ION cases; therefore, other risk factors remain unidentified. The lowest hematocrit was not significantly different between cases and controls. Within an acceptable range for adequate oxygen delivery, the exact hematocrit may be less important than whether the patient is euvolemic with a normal cardiac output, and perhaps what type of fluid (colloid versus crystalloid) is used to replace the blood loss that resulted in a lower hematocrit.</p><p>With the exception of male sex, the other risk factors are congruent with the theory that elevated venous pressure in the head and subsequent development of interstitial edema contribute to the occurrence of ION, although this theory remains speculative.</p><p>Based on findings from this study, the ASA convened a task force to develop recommendations for prevention of POVL associated with spine surgery. An ASA Practice Advisory for Perioperative Visual Loss Associated with Spine Surgery was created in 2006, updated in 2012, and again in 2019.(<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100130" href="/z/d/graphic/100130.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

Risk factors for CRAO related to cardiac surgery or spinal fusion surgery that were identified using data from the National Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2013 included many risk factors for vascular disease and hypercoagulability [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. Urgent or emergency spinal fusion surgery was also a risk factor. Data on potentially relevant aspects of perioperative care (eg, type of head rest, duration of surgery, blood pressure management, temporal association between the surgery and the diagnosis of CRAO) are limited in this database, making it difficult to fully identify perioperative risk factors. </p><p>During nasal or sinus surgery, injection of local anesthetic with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> or corticosteroid, or surgical trauma near the retinal vasculature, may cause vasospasm, embolism, or direct injury to the vasculature [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>].</p><p>A rare cause of CRAO relates to the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10086" href="/z/d/drug information/10086.html" rel="external">nitrous oxide</a> in patients who have had recent placement of gas expansion bubbles during vitrectomy for retinal detachment surgery [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. These gas bubbles may remain in the eye for 10 to 14 days when sulfur hexafluoride is injected, and up to 55 to 65 days when perfluorocarbon is injected [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Because nitrous oxide readily diffuses into the bubble, the bubble may increase in size and raise the intraocular pressure to levels that occlude central retinal artery flow. Permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve may occur with nitrous oxide administration for more than one to two hours. In a series of five patients with CRAO after gas bubble therapy, the time interval from placement of the gas bubble to anesthesia with nitrous oxide was 2 to 30 days, and four of five patients sustained permanent optic nerve damage [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The patient who did not sustain permanent damage was 25 days from insertion of the gas bubble and had a one-hour general anesthetic.</p><p>For prone procedures, the horseshoe headrest may increase the risk of CRAO [<a href="#rid41">41</a>], as the edges of the headrest are very close to the eyes, and slight movement of the head can cause globe compression. CRAO from this etiology was described as early as 1954 in a series of eight patients who developed unilateral blindness after prone spine surgery on a horseshoe headrest (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100127" href="/z/d/graphic/100127.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1197540843"><span class="h3">Diagnosis and management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postoperative CRAO is almost always unilateral, and patients typically complain of severe loss of vision in one eye immediately after awakening from anesthesia.

As an example, associated periorbital trauma such as corneal abrasion, supraorbital numbness or bruising, ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, and ptosis may be present, consistent with a mechanism of globe compression after prone surgery. The pupillary light reflex is sluggish or absent, and patients will exhibit a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).

It should be noted that this form of glaucoma is not related to the much more common form of glaucoma known as primary open angle glaucoma.

Rarely, it occurs in susceptible individuals after general anesthesia as a result of coughing, straining, vomiting, or extremely elevated blood pressure, particularly in the presence of anticoagulation. Incidence varies among surgical procedures, occurring in 0.04 percent of blepharoplasties [<a href="#rid45">45</a>], 0.43 percent of endoscopic sinus surgeries [<a href="#rid46">46</a>], and in up to 3.2 percent of orbital floor fractures [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Onset of symptoms typically occurs within three hours of surgery and the vast majority within 24 hours; however, onset may occur as many as nine days after surgery [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>].

Proptosis with severe stabbing pain, vision loss, and a sensation of pressure are common. Patients may also experience nausea and vomiting, diplopia, and visual flashes. External examination of the eye may reveal eyelid hematoma or ecchymosis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, proptosis, or ophthalmoplegia. If the optic nerve is compromised, pupillary light reflexes will be abnormal, with a relative afferent pupillary defect. Emergency ophthalmology consultation is indicated if the diagnosis is suspected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Definitive treatment is surgical. Immediate decompression with a lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis is the treatment of choice and may be performed at the bedside with local anesthesia. Emergency surgical decompression should not be delayed for imaging or administration of topical or systemic medications aimed at lowering intraocular pressure. Evacuation of the hematoma may be performed subsequent to decompression. Prognosis for vision is dependent on the time from the onset of symptoms to decompression, with poor outcomes reported in symptom-to-treatment intervals as short as four hours. Retrobulbar hematoma is responsible for almost half of all cases of visual loss associated with repair of orbital floor fractures [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – Prevention includes primarily surgical hemostasis, avoidance of excessive coughing and straining with emergence, and retching in the recovery room [<a href="#rid21">21,37-40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94404137"><span class="h2">Pituitary apoplexy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pituitary apoplexy is a <strong>life-threatening</strong> condition caused by sudden hemorrhage or infarction within the pituitary gland, frequently associated with a pituitary tumor. It is an exceedingly rare cause of POVL but is discussed here because its clinical presentation may overlap with postoperative posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION) and is one of the reasons that further imaging is required in cases suspected of having PION. (See <a class="local">'Postoperative ischemic optic neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p>Pituitary apoplexy has been reported after cardiac surgery and transurethral resection of the prostate [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology</strong> – Most cases of pituitary apoplexy occur in patients with pituitary adenomas, often unrecognized [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Risk factors include reduced blood flow in the pituitary gland (eg, increases in intracranial pressure, severe hemorrhagic hypotension, head trauma, pituitary irradiation), sudden increase in blood flow to the pituitary gland, stimulation of the pituitary gland by hormonal manipulation, and anticoagulation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Clinical presentation occurs immediately to several months postoperatively, though most occur within 48 hours of surgery. The symptoms include a diffuse, severe headache in the vast majority of patients. Most patients with pituitary apoplexy have nausea, decreased visual acuity, ophthalmoplegia, and visual field deficits [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Cranial nerve III is most commonly involved and may manifest as a unilaterally dilated, fixed pupil with ptosis and diplopia. Altered mental status and Addisonian crisis may occur as well. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to confirm hemorrhage into the sella turcica. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6636.html" rel="external">"Causes of hypopituitarism", section on 'Pituitary apoplexy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Treatment consists of surgical decompression for cases with visual changes or altered mental status, but less severe cases may be managed with high-dose corticosteroids and endocrine replacement therapy alone.

Visual symptoms can include a self-limited decrease in visual acuity, blurred vision, or blindness [<a href="#rid53">53-55</a>]. Neurologic symptoms may be caused by the hyponatremia that results from absorption of large quantities of irrigant, or by neurotoxic effects of glycine and some of its metabolites. Glycine crosses the blood brain barrier where it depresses retinal neurons, with the greatest effect on the amacrine cells. Serine, ammonia, glyoxylate, and other metabolites may also play a role. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2363.html" rel="external">"Hyponatremia following transurethral resection, hysteroscopy, or other procedures involving electrolyte-free irrigation", section on 'Pathogenesis of neurologic symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Onset of symptoms may occur intraoperatively to several hours postoperatively. Nausea usually occurs first as a result of the hyponatremia that accompanies the absorption of irrigant.

Pupillary light reflexes vary from sluggish to nonreactive and dilated and may depend on the severity of glycine toxicity and associated hyponatremia. Funduscopic examination is normal.
