An overview of specific causes of limp in children is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6460.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of limp in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H973493290"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Limp is a relatively common complaint in childhood. Many conditions may manifest with a limp  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343" href="/d/graphic/76343.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Based upon small observational studies of presentations to the emergency department or primary care practice, the hip and the knee are the most common locations for pathology; minor trauma and toxic synovitis of the hip predominate as the typical cause for limp [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Thus, most children with limp who are evaluated in these primary or emergency care settings do not require specialty referral. The cause of limp usually can be determined through a careful history and physical examination with selected ancillary studies. While most cases of limp are caused by benign self-limiting conditions that resolve spontaneously [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], life- or limb-threatening conditions can occur and must be diagnosed promptly  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119013" href="/d/graphic/119013.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4082700544"><span class="h1">NORMAL GAIT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most children are able to walk with assistance by the time they are 12 months of age, to walk independently at 15 months, and to run by 18 months [<a href="#rid2">2,6</a>]. The normal gait is smooth, rhythmic, symmetric, and effortless  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53103" href="/d/graphic/53103.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Relative to older children and adults, the gait of children younger than 3 to 3.5 years of age is notable for:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased flexion of the hips, knees, and ankles, which provides a lower center of gravity and facilitates balance</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rotation of the feet externally and more spread in relation to the shoulder width, providing a wider base of support</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A smaller percentage of the gait cycle spent in single limb stance</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A faster cadence but slower velocity because of shorter stride length</p><p></p><p>Children have typically achieved the adult pattern of gait by seven years of age. The biomechanics of a normal gait and the assessment of gait in athletes is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113980.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of walking and running gait"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3868309081"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF LIMP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Limp is defined as an abnormality in gait that is caused by pain, weakness, or deformity [<a href="#rid1">1,2,6,7</a>]. In toddlers and young children, conditions that cause limp may present as a refusal to walk or stand. At times, ataxia may masquerade as a limp, but a careful examination usually distinguishes this condition based on the absence of tenderness, weakness, or deformity, and the presence of movements, often involving the trunk or upper extremities as well as the lower extremities, characteristic of cerebellar dysfunction.</p><p>Limp can be further described by gait pathology, which can help narrow the differential diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62511" href="/d/graphic/62511.html" rel="external">table 3</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antalgic gait – Antalgic gait is the most common type of limp encountered in children; it is characterized by a short stance phase on the affected extremity due to pain. An antalgic gait is associated with bone and soft tissue trauma, infection, inflammation, and bony lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Toe-walking gait – A child will toe-walk due to heel pain, calf pain, idiopathic heel cord tightness, or neurologic abnormality with increased flexor muscle tone in the lower leg. Examples of conditions that may present with toe-walking include cerebral palsy, peripheral neuropathy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, or spinal cord disorder [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Influenza A may cause acute calf myositis with self-limited toe-walking.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stooping gait – A stooping gait with hips flexed throughout the gait cycle suggests psoas muscle or obturator nerve irritation associated with appendicitis, psoas muscle abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion, or testicular torsion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trendelenburg gait – Trendelenburg gait describes a downward pelvic tilt or shift toward the unaffected limb as it swings through caused by gluteus medius muscle weakness or spasm in the affected leg when it is in stance phase  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74735" href="/d/graphic/74735.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). This gait frequently accompanies slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, and developmental dysplasia of the hip.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Steppage gait – Patients with a foot drop due to neurologic disease display exaggerated hip and knee flexion as the affected leg swings through to keep the foot from dragging on the floor. It is often accompanied by a slap of the foot during heel strike.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vaulting gait – Patients with limb length discrepancy or abnormal knee mobility maintain the knee hyperextended and locked at the end of stance phase and "vault" over the affected leg.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4045914625"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The causes of limp in children and differentiating features are provided separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119013" href="/d/graphic/119013.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6460.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of limp in children"</a>.) </p><p>Etiologies of limp in children can also be organized according to age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121369" href="/d/graphic/121369.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), the location of abnormal physical findings  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343" href="/d/graphic/76343.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) or type of gait abnormality  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62511" href="/d/graphic/62511.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,9-11</a>].</p><p>In addition to pathology in the lower extremity, limp can also be caused by abnormalities of the nervous system, back, abdomen, or genitourinary tract (see <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below). The location of pain does not always reflect the location of pathology [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hip conditions can cause pain in the knee or thigh</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abdominal conditions may cause hip or thigh pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Back conditions may have referred pain down the back of the leg or to the lateral thigh</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A careful history and physical examination provide important information regarding the likely cause for the limp and guide the approach to radiographic studies and laboratory testing. Life-threatening or emergency conditions must be diagnosed promptly  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119013" href="/d/graphic/119013.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2035997931"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several historical features help identify possible causes for limp  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63220" href="/d/graphic/63220.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2,7,12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age</strong> – Several conditions are much more likely, depending upon the patient's age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121369" href="/d/graphic/121369.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration</strong> – Limps of acute onset are typically due to trauma or acute infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Chronic limps more often arise from Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), rheumatic disease, malignancy, benign bone tumor, developmental dysplasia of the hip, overuse syndromes, apophysitis, osteochondrosis, leg length discrepancy, or neuromuscular disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Certain pathogens (eg, <em>Kingella kingae</em> and tuberculosis) can also cause indolent forms of osteomyelitis or bacterial arthritis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trauma</strong> – Soft tissue injury (eg, superficial or deep muscle contusion, ligamentous sprain, or muscle strain) and fractures often have a history of prior trauma. Toddler's fractures are notable because the trivial trauma that can cause this injury may often be unknown or overlooked by the caregiver. A history of trauma may be absent or implausible in cases of child abuse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A history of trivial trauma can be misleading in patients with an underlying osteomyelitis and delay diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6064.html" rel="external">"Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Clinical features and complications", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Fever suggests possible osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. Toxic synovitis may also present with an associated viral illness and fever. Acute rheumatic fever, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic lupus erythematosus, and leukemia are rare causes of fever and chronic limp. Fever may also be present among children with myositis due to viral infection, such as influenza. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Occasionally, an intercurrent febrile illness may obscure the diagnosis of a traumatic injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pain characteristics</strong> – Children with limp often have difficulty describing and localizing pain. However, certain pain features can help narrow the anatomic region and diagnoses of concern:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Constant severe pain that is localized and consistently reproducible is seen with fractures, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and sickle cell disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In addition to knee pathology, knee pain may signify referred pain from hip pathology (eg, SCFE or Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) rather than knee joint disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Back conditions may refer pain down the back of the leg or to the lateral thigh.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The preference to crawl or walk on the knees in toddlers may indicate foot pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermittent, less severe pain is characteristic of JIA, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, SCFE, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and transient synovitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cyclic pain that occurs at night or wakens the child suggests malignancy (eg, leukemia, osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma) or benign bone tumors (eg, osteoid osteoma). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6243.html" rel="external">"Overview of common presenting signs and symptoms of childhood cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6294.html" rel="external">"Nonmalignant bone lesions in children and adolescents", section on 'Osteoid osteoma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bilateral calf or thigh pain may indicate myositis, particularly in the setting of current infection with influenza.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lateral thigh pain may reflect sciatica and indicate a lumbar spine abnormality (eg, discitis, ruptured lumbar disc, vertebral osteomyelitis, spondylolisthesis, epidural abscess, or spinal cord tumor). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2856.html" rel="external">"Approach to hip pain in childhood"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain that worsens with activity suggests stress fracture, overuse injury (eg, osteochondrosis or apophysitis), or hypermobility syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain that improves with activity is characteristic of rheumatologic conditions and complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy). Complex regional pain syndrome is also suggested by pain that is out of proportion to the history.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Associated symptoms</strong> – Associated symptoms can help suggest specific etiologies:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Morning stiffness ("gel phenomenon") is often found in patients with oligoarticular JIA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Incontinence, sciatica, or leg weakness suggests a spinal cord problem (eg, acute flaccid myelitis, epidural abscess, closed spinal dysraphism with a tethered cord, or spinal cord tumor).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abdominal pain accompanies immunoglobulin A vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura), appendicitis with periappendiceal abscess, psoas abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease, or ovarian torsion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Back pain may indicate discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, spinal epidural abscess, or a herniated disc.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Migratory arthralgias are characteristic of acute rheumatic fever and gonococcal arthritis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rash with a limp may be seen in patients with:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura, palpable purpura  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef134598" href="/d/graphic/134598.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef119923" href="/d/graphic/119923.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>)) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6406.html" rel="external">"IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91346" href="/d/graphic/91346.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) and/or erythema multiforme minor  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52352" href="/d/graphic/52352.html" rel="external">picture 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78100" href="/d/graphic/78100.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>)) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2078.html" rel="external">"Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus (malar rash) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Gonococcal arthritis (pustular or vesicular pustular lesions on palms and soles  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69978" href="/d/graphic/69978.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>)) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7603.html" rel="external">"Disseminated gonococcal infection"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Past medical history</strong> – Pertinent past medical history includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Upper respiratory viral illness may precede transient synovitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recent use of antibiotics (eg, penicillin, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13122" href="/d/drug information/13122.html" rel="external">cefaclor</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12631" href="/d/drug information/12631.html" rel="external">amoxicillin</a>, or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12816" href="/d/drug information/12816.html" rel="external">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>) is associated with serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions; they may also alter the presentation of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Antecedent urogenital or gastrointestinal bacterial infection points to reactive arthritis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of sickle cell disease supports vaso-occlusive crisis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of hemophilia suggests spontaneous hemarthrosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with hypothyroidism, panhypopituitarism, and hypogonadism are at increased risk for developing SCFE.

Pain may be the underlying cause of patient irritability or refusal to cooperate; judicious use of nonopioid analgesics (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13028" href="/d/drug information/13028.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>) may permit a better examination in some patients.</p><p>Children who refuse to bear weight on the leg should not be forced to walk until further assessment has excluded fracture or other serious pathology (eg, SCFE), which may be worsened by weight-bearing. Otherwise, the physician should enlist the parent or caregiver to help with gait evaluation by having them take the child for a walk in the room or hallway so that the gait can be observed. (See <a class="local">'Gait'</a> below.)</p><p>After evaluation of the gait or if gait evaluation is deferred, further examination is best performed with the young child sitting in the caregiver's lap. The physician should start by observing the child's appearance and positioning from a distance and observing how they hold or move the lower extremities. If the child is upset, the physician should permit time for the parent to calm the child. Distraction with a toy or bright object may also be useful. If a specific site of pain is suggested by the history, it should be examined last. In an uncooperative child, it is sometimes useful to have the parent palpate down the normal leg, and then palpate down the painful leg. This can often localize the painful area without the fear of the examiner.</p><p>If the source of the limp cannot be localized clearly by the history and simple observation (which is often the case in the young or nonverbal child), the clinician must perform a systematic physical examination of the spine, central and peripheral nervous system, hips, knees, ankles, and feet [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In addition, the abdomen and external genitalia should be examined to identify unusual causes of limp (eg, psoas abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease, or testicular torsion). Obvious traumatic injury on examination in the absence of a credible history suggests child abuse.

The tables summarize the causes of limp in children  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119013" href="/d/graphic/119013.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), highlighting the common presentations based on age  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121369" href="/d/graphic/121369.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), location of physical findings  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343" href="/d/graphic/76343.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) or type of gait  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62511" href="/d/graphic/62511.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Definition of limp'</a> above and <a class="local">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition to pathology in the lower extremity, limp can also be caused by abnormalities of the nervous system, back, abdomen, or genitourinary tract. The location of pain does not always reflect the location of pathology:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hip conditions can cause pain in the knee or thigh</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Abdominal conditions may cause hip or thigh pain</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Back conditions may have referred pain down the back of the leg or to the lateral thigh</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> – During the history, the clinician should determine the duration of the limp (acute, subacute, or chronic), presence of fever, whether there is a history of trauma, any focal site of pain, pain characteristics, and associated symptoms, such as abdominal pain, back pain, joint pain, morning stiffness, recent illness, ataxia, or weakness  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63220" href="/d/graphic/63220.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bone pain that occurs at night or at rest and without a history of trauma is found more commonly in patients with neoplastic conditions (eg, leukemia, osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma) and benign tumors (eg, osteoid osteoma). Ill appearance or significant pain also suggests a more serious cause of limp. Infectious or inflammatory etiologies are often, but not always, associated with fever. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'General appearance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – A careful physical examination helps to narrow the differential diagnosis of the limping child, especially when physical findings suggest a likely site of abnormality either in the lower extremity or elsewhere (eg, the abdomen, spinal column, or neuromuscular system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343" href="/d/graphic/76343.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)). (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Older children and adolescents usually can cooperate with the physical examination. Children who refuse to bear weight on the leg should <strong>not</strong> be forced to walk until further assessment has excluded fracture or other serious pathology that may be worsened by weight-bearing. (See <a class="local">'Approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the source of the limp cannot be localized clearly by the history and simple observation (which is often the case in the young or nonverbal child), the examiner must proceed systematically through examination of the central nervous system (CNS), spine, peripheral nervous system, hips, knees, ankles, and feet. In addition, the abdomen and external genitalia should be examined to identify unusual causes of limp (eg, psoas abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease, or testicular torsion). The examination should proceed from areas of least concern to the site of suspected pathology. (See <a class="local">'Approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic approach</strong> – The history and physical examination should guide further evaluation. Laboratory studies and/or imaging are usually <strong>not</strong> indicated in the child with an obvious cause for a limp such as a superficial soft tissue injury; insect bite or sting; plantar wart; hand, foot, and mouth disease; or blister. In addition, an afebrile child with a history of an acute limp but a normal physical examination, including a normal gait, does <strong>not</strong> typically warrant further investigation at the initial visit. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Otherwise, further evaluation, as described above, is warranted in the limping child, especially in patients with the following features (see <a class="local">'Acute limp'</a> above and <a class="local">'Subacute, chronic, or intermittent limp'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Three years of age and younger</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Signs of infection (eg, fever; exquisite joint tenderness with marked limitation of motion; or localized redness, warmth, or swelling)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Limitation of joint movement on examination, especially at the hip</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inability to walk</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of chronic or intermittent limp</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – The management of the child with a limp depends upon the results of the initial evaluation.
