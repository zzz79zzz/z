Additional features of the disorder have a variable presentation, contributing to disagreement over the disorder’s boundaries and diagnostic criteria.</p><p>The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) focuses on a more aggressive, grandiose subtype of NPD, while an alternative model, which we favor, describes additional subtypes – a healthier, high-functioning type and a vulnerable, introverted type – and places greater emphasis on problems with self-definition, self-esteem regulation, and affective reactivity.</p><p>NPD is one of the least studied personality disorders. It appears to be prevalent, highly comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, and associated with significant psychosocial disability. NPD is difficult to treat, and can complicate the treatment of co-occurring disorders.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of NPD are reviewed here. Treatment of NPD is described separately. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis of other personality disorders are also described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108421.html" rel="external">"Narcissistic personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6617.html" rel="external">"Overview of personality disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6619.html" rel="external">"Borderline personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14760.html" rel="external">"Antisocial personality disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1618256167"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence and sociodemographic features of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are poorly defined, in part because of evolving diagnostic criteria.</p><p>In studies in the United States and in Europe, the prevalence of NPD in the general population has been estimated as ranging from 0 percent to 6.2 percent [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. As an example, in a national survey of 35,000 Americans, the lifetime prevalence rate was 6.2 percent; rates were higher in males compared to females (7.7 versus 4.8 percent). In that survey, NPD was significantly more prevalent among Black males and females and Hispanic females, younger adults, and single adults.</p><p>In clinical studies of outpatient populations, the rate of NPD has ranged from 1 to 17 percent [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]; most studies report higher prevalence among males.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3804251578"><span class="h2">Comorbidities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Co-occurring disorders are common in clinical observations and in epidemiologic surveys of NPD. Among respondents meeting criteria for NPD in the 2004 to 2005 Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, the disorders with the highest rates of comorbidity were [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>49.5 percent for mood disorders </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Major depressive disorder – 20.6 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bipolar I disorder – 20.1 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>54.7 percent for anxiety disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>64.2 percent for substance use disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>62.9 percent for other personality disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Borderline personality disorder – 37.0 percent</p><p></p><p>NPD also often co-occurs with antisocial, histrionic, schizotypal, and passive-aggressive personality disorders [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Patients with more severe NPD are more likely to have a greater number of co-occurring personality disorders [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Comorbidity with antisocial personality disorder has the most profoundly negative impact on prognosis [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>Patients with NPD often come to clinical attention seeking treatment for a co-occurring disorder. Comorbidities can complicate diagnosis and treatment decisions; their presence in patients with NPD has been associated with greater functional impairment and elevated suicide risk compared with patients without co-occurring disorders [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>The presence of comorbid narcissistic pathology in individuals presenting with substance use disorders, mood disorders, or anxiety disorders, can greatly complicate management and is associated with a worse prognosis compared with patients lacking comorbid narcissistic pathology [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2768111651"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is not known. Most hypotheses invoke a combination of and interaction among genetic, biologic, and psychosocial causes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2028591608"><span class="h2">Genetic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with other personality disorders, studies of heritability for NPD are suggestive but inconsistent. Studies of personality disorders overall demonstrate heritability rates above 60 percent, making a significant genetic influence highly likely [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. NPD has not been assessed in any family or adoption studies, but twin studies suggest heritability varying from 25 percent to 79 percent. A study using a broad definition of NPD (three or more criteria met) found 45 percent concordance in monozygotic twins and 9 percent in dizygotic twins [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A study using the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology reported the heritability of narcissism to be 53 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The heritability of specific traits (need for adulation, attention seeking, grandiosity, and need for approval) ranged from 37 percent for grandiosity to 50 percent for need for approval.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H689965787"><span class="h2">Biologic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Research relating to biologic factors and NPD is sparse. Brain imaging studies on the neural correlates of empathy have included studies of NPD as well as those of subjects with narcissistic traits [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. These studies provide preliminary data on neural correlates of the impaired emotional empathy characteristic of individuals with NPD. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2011 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that subjects with high and low scores on the Narcissistic Inventory questionnaire performed differently when processing emotional faces [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The group with high narcissistic scores showed differences in the right anterior insula, a region associated with empathy in previous studies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2013 fMRI study of 17 patients diagnosed with NPD showed structural differences compared with controls in the right anterior insula, the left anterior insula, rostral, and median cingulate cortex, as well as the dorsolateral and medial parts of the prefrontal cortex [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. These brain regions have been described as broadly overlapping with the neural circuitry commonly implicated in the representation of empathy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1736885854"><span class="h2">Psychosocial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The empirical literature on parenting and NPD is inconsistent, but overall provides some support for the proposition that parenting styles can contribute to the development of NPD, and that different facets of narcissism may have different psychosocial etiologies [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In the absence of empirical data, models of pathogenesis based on clinical experience with NPD patients and observations of parenting have been developed within psychodynamic, attachment, and social learning frameworks [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>].</p><p>These models relate NPD to problems in the development of a sense of self in early life, and increasingly emphasize the role of the child’s genetic predisposition in shaping both the child’s responses to the environment as well as in shaping his or her environment (ie, eliciting particular responses from caretakers). It has been hypothesized that disruptions in the caretaker-child relationship, reflecting parental failure to adequately meet the developmental needs of the child in the setting of the child’s temperamental predispositions, interfere with normal developmental processes. These deficiencies are compounded over time as a result of repeated, pathogenic interactions with caretakers and the child’s resulting expectations and behavior in relation to others.</p><p>Theorists have pointed variously to the role of parental over-involvement, overprotectiveness, and overvaluation of the child, often coupled with excessive frustration, parental coldness, aggression, and rejection, as potentially contributory to the development of narcissistic pathology in childhood and NPD later in life.</p><p>Though most children who experience trauma do not develop personality disorders, evidence from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>] shows an overall association between NPD (and other personality disorders) and childhood abuse and neglect [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Other research supports the association between emotional abuse and NPD, specifically with covert narcissistic traits [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1845050181"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among the personality disorders, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is associated with the most variable presentation and the widest range of severity. There is strong agreement among clinicians and researchers with expertise on the subject that there are different subtypes of NPD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2427371668"><span class="h2">Core features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the variability among presentations, all individuals with NPD share central clinical features, some of which are and some of which are not emphasized in DSM-5-TR (see <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below):</p><p>In DSM-5-TR:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grandiosity, either overt or covert</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive need for admiration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Superficial and exploitative relationships</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of empathy</p><p></p><p>Not in DSM-5-TR:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identity disturbance</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Difficulty with attachment and dependency</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic feelings of emptiness and boredom</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vulnerability to life transitions</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2082635182"><span class="h3">Grandiosity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with NPD have an exaggerated sense of self-importance, viewing themselves as superior to others and deserving of special treatment. Feelings of superiority are often overt, but may also be covert, hidden behind feelings of inferiority or deficiency. (See <a class="local">'Subtypes'</a> below.)</p><p>Grandiose attitudes, whether overt or covert, and feelings of being exceptional or special, are often complemented by private fantasies of unlimited success, beauty, brilliance, power, or ideal love.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3700408287"><span class="h3">Excessive need for admiration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with NPD have an excessive need for admiration. They have a constant need to experience themselves as the center of attention, regardless of the setting, perpetually grabbing the limelight and monopolizing social conversations. When attention is not forthcoming, or others receive the attention they feel they themselves deserve, the individuals with NPD are prone to feeling slighted, mistreated depleted, and enraged.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3981859584"><span class="h3">Superficial and exploitative relationships</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NPD is characterized by markedly superficial relationships, based on surface attributes rather than the unique personal qualities of the other. Relationships are valued only to the extent that they are viewed as beneficial, either providing material gain or enhancing self-esteem. As a result, individuals with NPD are often drawn to wealthy, beautiful, or famous people, with the aim of self-enhancement.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3969610185"><span class="h3">Lack of empathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with NPD lack the capacity to empathize with the needs of others. Some individuals with NPD may be excessively attuned to the reactions of others, but only if these reactions are perceived as relevant to the self, while others may seem strangely oblivious. In either case, emotional empathy, the ability to “feel with,” or care about the emotional needs or experience of others, even one’s closest loved ones, is severely limited, and may be totally lacking, in NPD [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2080236190"><span class="h3">Identity disturbance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Underlying the spectrum of NPD presentations is a disturbance of identity formation. In contrast to the flexible and reality-based self-experience that characterizes normal identity formation, or the fragmented, black and white views of self in relation to others that characterize identity formation in borderline personality disorder, in NPD we see a sense of self that is relatively stable, but highly superficial, extremely rigid, and often fragile – a disturbed self-state in which stability depends on maintaining the view that one is exceptional. This grandiose and rigidly inflexible sense of self is easily threatened, sustained only by receiving constant feedback of superiority from the environment, and collapsing when such feedback in unavailable. To maintain the integrity of their self-state, individuals with NPD must retreat from or deny any realities that might challenge their grandiosity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H717326972"><span class="h3">Attachment and dependence difficulties</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In NPD, self-esteem and self-definition are entirely reliant on feedback from the environment. In this circumstance, relationships are “functional” tools to shore up positive self-states and self-definition. Interactions with others remain superficial and need-fulfilling in orientation. Genuine intimacy is avoided insofar as it confronts narcissistic individuals with the recognition that others have desirable attributes that they themselves lack.</p><p>Narcissistic relationships have high measured rates of “vindictive and contemptuous behavior,” along with low empathy scores [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Results of a study on the effect of narcissistic features in marriages confirm the expected steep decline in marital satisfaction and steep increases in marital problems over time [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1716010729"><span class="h3">Chronic emptiness and boredom</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Narcissistic patients complain frequently of emptiness, restlessness, and boredom – affective experiences that appear to represent baseline emotional states in NPD. In the setting of narcissistic pathology, emotion regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-states and self-esteem; attention seeking and the admiration of others will lead to positive affect states, but when attention and praise are not available, individuals with NPD quickly become restless and feel depleted, empty, or depressed. The diminished capacity to invest deeply in relationships or in creativity, beyond gratification of narcissistic goals, is a chronic vulnerability to feelings of emptiness and boredom [<a href="#rid17">17,26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H828867297"><span class="h3">Life transition vulnerabilities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The nature of identity formation in NPD can make it difficult to maintain reality-based personal and professional goals over time. The incremental growth, the deferred gratification, and the compromises required by school, jobs, or relationships can feel intolerable, and patients often withdraw to protect their feelings of specialness. At the same time, narcissistic individuals of any age may convey a sense that time is suspended, as if they exist outside of and are exempt from the passage of years; they may defer careers or relationships in the implicit belief that they are in a perpetual state of youthful potential.</p><p>Young adults with pathological narcissism can present with a syndrome of “failure to launch.” These stalled transitions occur as students move from high school to college, or from college to postgraduate training or to careers; young adults may stop attending classes, or not complete job applications or fail to attend interviews at the precise moment these failures will be the most damaging. Realistically pursuing a particular career path or academic degree can be felt as “ordinary,” or as “settling for less,” a perceived limit on the grandiose fantasies by which these individuals have been sustained.</p><p>The aging process can be especially challenging for individuals with NPD. Older adult narcissists can become depressed or act out as their function declines in old age and as they feel they are receiving decreased attention from others (often because of their exploitative and superficial relationships); it can be a devastating realization that expectations of uniqueness and specialness have not been met [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2877484892"><span class="h2">Subtypes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is strong empirical and clinical support for two distinct presentations, or subtypes, of NPD, the grandiose or “overt” subtype and the vulnerable or “covert” subtype [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The distinction between subtypes depends on whether core narcissistic grandiosity is openly expressed or masked, and whether stability is maintained by outward arrogance and evoked praise, or by hiding grandiose self-states behind feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. There is growing empirical and clinical support for a third, high-functioning subtype of NPD [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Though with dramatically different presentations and levels of functioning, individuals in all three subtypes suffer from a grandiose and superficial sense of self, poverty of interpersonal relations and intimacy, and deficiencies in empathy described above. (See <a class="local">'Core features'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4066510001"><span class="h3">High-functioning subtype</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The high-functioning, exhibitionistic, autonomous subtype of NPD is relatively adaptive and stable. Individuals in this group may not appear, at first glance, to have a personality disorder at all. They are competitive, arrogant, and have an exaggerated sense of self-importance. While their grandiosity and excessive need for admiration interfere with the ability to obtain sustained gratification from work or personal relationships, they are otherwise able to use their narcissistic traits to succeed. These individuals may act out sexually to bolster self-esteem and obtain needed stimulation, and often complain of boredom.</p><p>Mr. A is a 55-year-old married man who presents complaining of marital dissatisfaction. He has a successful academic research career, and is highly competitive inside of work and out; he has an active social life, but he identifies himself in groups as the “alpha” and likes to be the center of attention. Mr. A describes that at the very beginning of his marriage there was a modicum of closeness and an engaged sexual life, but he soon became bored with his wife and lost interest. He has had affairs with a series of women who were not his social and intellectual equals, and whom he supported with housing and funds. He denies that his infidelities have had any impact on his relationship with his wife (“one has nothing to do with the other”), but is chronically troubled by the sense that could he “do better” with someone else.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3304795749"><span class="h3">Grandiose/overt subtype</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The grandiose, overt, “thick-skinned” subtype of NPD corresponds closely with description of NPD in the DSM-5-TR. In this group the sense of being exceptional is overt; these individuals appear arrogant, entitled, and demonstrate little observable anxiety. Socially, they are extraverted and attention seeking, and can be superficially charming and socially adept, but struggle with closeness and feelings of dependency. Interpersonally, they are exploitative, lack true empathy, and use their understanding of other’s needs for their own self-advancement. Individuals in this group can be aggressive or intimidating, especially when threatened.</p><p>Ms. B is a 29-year-old single woman with a history of opiate and marijuana use, currently unemployed. She presented to her local urgent care clinic for back pain not responsive to conventional analgesics and requesting <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9729" href="/d/drug information/9729.html" rel="external">oxycodone</a> (“nothing else works!”). She was flattering and flirtatious with the resident physician who took her history and examined her; when he explained that he would have to speak with her primary care physician before writing a prescription for a narcotic, Ms. B began to insult and bully him. The resident spoke with Ms. B’s sister, whose contact information Ms. B provided. The sister explained that the patient was estranged from the family because she had financially exploited her siblings and her parents.

In this group, the grandiosity and sense of being exceptional that characterize NPD are superficially masked, cloaked in overt feelings of deficiency. These individuals suffer from chronic feelings of inferiority and inadequacy, are preoccupied with evaluating themselves in relation to others, and are extraordinarily self-absorbed. Socially they appear inhibited, shy, withdrawn, and hypersensitive to criticism (“thin-skinned”). This surface presentation masks more commonplace features of narcissism: they are privately absorbed with envying and devaluing others, and frequently withdraw from life’s challenges to protect their hidden grandiosity and entitlement. They often harbor fantasies that they will “eventually” triumph, or that they are special, unique, but fragile, and so sequester themselves from a world for which they feel contempt. In adolescents, a common feature of vulnerable narcissism is a “failure to launch.”</p><p>Mr. C is a 33-year-old single man with a history of Crohn disease who presented to an outpatient mental health clinic for treatment of chronic mild depression and social phobia. Immediately after college he began a career-level job, but quit when he was passed over for advancement. Since that time, he has held a series of low-level jobs that “have not worked out,” and he currently works part-time stocking shelves at a local pharmacy. At his assessment at the clinic he describes his mood as “depressed…forever.” He has no friends or romantic attachments, no hobbies or passions, and regularly tells his family that he is bored and that “life is not worth living.” He avoids his Crohn medication when he gets depressed and eats foods that trigger his symptoms; he has had multiple hospitalizations for bleeding and abdominal pain. He tells his interviewer he feels he is inadequate and a failure, but also that he resents others’ advantages and success. He blames his failures on people who don’t recognize all he has to offer. He fantasizes that his employer will finally recognize his special talents and promote him to a senior managerial position; at other times, he imagines humiliating his boss with a display of superior knowledge.</p><p>Many individuals with NPD fluctuate between grandiose and vulnerable states [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Because these individuals are characteristically rigid and adapt poorly, changes in external circumstances can lead to extreme shifts in mood and level of functioning. The grandiose narcissist may feel helpless and victimized, his grandiosity deflated, when served with divorce papers, for example; it would be typical that he reconstitute with the restored conviction that the partner is unworthy, with no sense of his own role in the conflict. A successful venture may induce a brief period of exalted confidence and grandiosity in the vulnerable, withdrawn narcissist, which then may crumble as they are confronted with increased responsibilities and expectations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H568232252"><span class="h2">Suicide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NPD is a significant risk factor for completed suicide, for suicide attempts, and for suicide attempts of high lethality.

Much of the literature and our clinical experience suggest that narcissistic features persist over time; these patients appear to be resistant to treatment and to change. Some research, however, suggests that aspects of NPD may remit:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A three-year prospective longitudinal study of 20 patients with NPD, each receiving treatment or supportive care, found that approximately half the patients achieved diagnostic remission, with significant decrease in the overall level of pathological narcissism [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

Patients should be assessed for comorbid mental disorders that can complicate treatment, and a detailed substance history is essential. (See <a class="local">'Comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p>In the clinical interview, focusing on the patient’s descriptions of significant others can be particularly helpful in diagnosing NPD. These descriptions are characteristically derogating or, alternatively, colored by idealization. Most striking, however, is the markedly superficial and vague, shadowy quality of the narcissistic individual’s experience of others. In contrast, the narcissistic individual’s sense of him- or herself may be more intact and nuanced, albeit colored by grandiosity and self-deprecation.</p><p>The patient should be assessed for vulnerable as well as grandiose forms of narcissistic pathology.

In this view, the DSM-5-TR criteria describe a highly disturbed and aggressive subset of the NPD population, corresponding quite closely to the grandiose subtype, while failing to cover vulnerable and high-functioning NPD subtypes.
