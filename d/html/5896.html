         Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease of the pancreas. It often begins as acute pancreatitis and variably progresses to chronic pancreatitis over months to years, depending on etiology and modifying factors. The severity of clinical signs and symptoms vary between patients, and more advanced disease is characterized by pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, and sometimes pancreatic exocrine or endocrine dysfunction.

         The clinical manifestations of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis are similar regardless of the etiology. The child may have had a recognized episode of pancreatitis or may present with what appears to be the initial episode of pancreatitis but with a history of unexplained abdominal pain. The most common presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and poor growth. Less commonly, patients may be asymptomatic or present only after developing signs of pancreatic failure (eg, malabsorption, diabetes), which occur late in the course [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. The age of onset, rate of disease progression, and prognosis depend upon the specific etiology and severity of the underlying condition or process. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5895.html" rel="external">

         Abdominal pain is the cardinal feature of chronic pancreatitis. The pain typically is epigastric, often radiates to the back, is often associated with nausea and vomiting, and may be relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward. The pain may sometimes be poorly localized and recognized in retrospect as a symptom of chronic pancreatitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pain pattern varies among patients and may change during the course of the disease. Early in the course of chronic pancreatitis, the pain may occur in discrete attacks; as the condition progresses, pain tends to become more continuous. In some patients, with the loss of pancreatic tissue and fibrosis, the pain eventually improves [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, in a long-term study of the natural history of chronic pancreatitis in 335 adults, the majority did not experience pain relief (so-called "burnout") over more than 10 years of clinical follow-up [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic pain, similar to other visceral pain syndromes, may evolve and lead to both peripheral and central sensitization. Patients may experience hyperalgesia or neuropathic pain or both. Symptoms at sites inconsistent with pancreatic pain are legitimate symptoms of chronic pain, although this pattern is sometimes misinterpreted as falsified pain or malingering [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Hyperalgesia is generally recognized as severe pain in response to light touch or brushing of the abdomen. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain in the absence of a clear nociceptive stimulus (eg, phantom limb pain). Neuropathic pain may be difficult to confirm in chronic pancreatitis because it can be difficult or impossible to demonstrate the absence of inflammation in the pancreas, yet studies suggest it is a component of pain in chronic pancreatitis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pain management'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Age and maturity may also affect a child's experience or expression of pain. Very young children may be irritable rather than complaining specifically of pain. Some children may develop depression and/or anxiety associated with chronic abdominal pain but complain of pain rather than expressing these psychological symptoms. Other children may deny pain because of fear of "shots" for pain relief.
        </p>
        <p>
         The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in children is broad and includes physiologic and functional disorders. Functional abdominal pain is the most common cause of chronic or recurrent abdominal pain in children. Functional abdominal pain usually is not related to meals, is rarely associated with vomiting, and does not affect the child's growth. The clinician must attempt to distinguish between possible causes of abdominal pain based on the clinical pattern of symptoms, supported by carefully selected laboratory testing. (See

         Patients with chronic pancreatitis may develop malabsorption of protein and fat due to exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. However, clinically significant protein and fat deficiencies do not occur until more than 70 to 90 percent of pancreatic exocrine function is lost [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In a national series of 200 patients with hereditary pancreatitis in France, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency eventually developed in 34 percent and presented at a mean age of 29 years [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 324 children with chronic pancreatitis, 33.1 percent had exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by a mean age of 12 years [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Clinically important nutrient deficiencies may occur in the absence of steatorrhea [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical manifestations of fat malabsorption include loose, greasy, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush. Untreated malabsorption can cause some of the pain experienced by patients with chronic pancreatitis. It should be noted that these stool characteristics are not consistently found in patients with fat malabsorption, and growth failure may be the main finding. Malabsorption of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and vitamin B12 also may occur, although clinically symptomatic vitamin deficiency is rare [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Malabsorption may also affect levels of other micronutrients, including magnesium, iron, zinc, and

         Patients with chronic pancreatitis may develop endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, manifested by glucose intolerance. Routine screening for diabetes is appropriate in patients with advanced pancreatic disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Overt diabetes mellitus is common late in the course of chronic pancreatitis [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,17
         </a>
         ]. In a national series of 200 patients with hereditary pancreatitis in France, diabetes mellitus was reported in 26 percent and presented at a mean age of 38 years [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. However, there is evidence of increased risk for diabetes early in the disease course of acute recurrent pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. In an international registry of pediatric patients (mean age about 12 years) with chronic pancreatitis, 8.7 percent were reported to have diabetes mellitus [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]; this is approximately 30 times higher than the prevalence of diabetes in the general pediatric population [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. At least one-quarter of the patients with diabetes had beta cell autoantibodies, suggesting that an autoimmune mechanism may contribute to diabetes in this population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diabetes caused by chronic pancreatitis is known as pancreatic diabetes, or type 3c diabetes [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The primary abnormality is decreased insulin secretion, similar to type 1 diabetes. However, pancreatic diabetes is also characterized by impaired secretion of glucagon, which leads to hypoglycemia due to loss of the pancreatic counterregulatory mechanism. The problem of glucose control in patients with pancreatic diabetes is exacerbated by diminished pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion with maldigestion and delayed nutrient absorption as well as altered gut hormone secretion. As a result, patients with this disorder are at increased risk for hypoglycemia. Ketoacidosis is relatively rare. However, some individuals with diabetes and chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis have characteristics of types 1 or 2 diabetes; understanding this variation and how it impacts management is a goal of future study [
         <a href="#rid18">

         The pace and severity of disease progression varies among patients. More advanced disease is characterized by pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, duct distortion and strictures, calcifications, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, and dysplasia, typically with symptoms of chronic pain, weight loss, and malnutrition. In advanced disease, the structural changes, pain syndromes, and exocrine and/or endocrine pancreatic insufficiency appear to be irreversible [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,20
         </a>
         ]. The structural changes include irregular sclerotic and diffuse or focal destruction, acinar cell loss, islet cell loss, inflammatory cell infiltrate, and pancreatic duct abnormalities. Intraductal obstruction may be caused by protein plugs and/or calculi.

         Chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis should be suspected in any child presenting with severe chronic or recurrent abdominal pain. The first step is a focused history and physical examination to help to distinguish this disorder from other causes of abdominal pain. If this evaluation is consistent with pancreatitis, further steps include laboratory testing and imaging, which are necessary to make the diagnosis  (

         The initial onset, location, nature, duration, and progression of epigastric pain episodes should be established, as well as whether the episodes are triggered by food or exercise and whether there is associated vomiting (with or without flu-like symptoms). The pain associated with pancreatitis often radiates, particularly into the back. These characteristics can help to distinguish the pain of pancreatitis from the many other physiologic and functional causes of abdominal pain. A standardized pain Likert score may be useful, either a numeric system for older children or a FACES scale for younger children  (

         Abdominal examination – This provides information to support or rule out the diagnosis and also helps to identify options for pain management. In patients with pancreatitis, the site(s) of maximal tenderness are generally the mid-epigastric but may also be right and left upper quadrants. The spleen should be evaluated; splenomegaly suggests the possibility of splenic vein thrombosis, which can be a complication of chronic pancreatitis. Signs of constipation may be present and can be triggered by opioid use or poor fluid intake.

         If the history and physical examination suggest a high index of suspicion for chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis, the next steps are laboratory testing and imaging to provide further evidence of the diagnosis and to evaluate for complications of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis.

         Laboratory tests provide important biomarker evidence of pancreatic dysfunction but cannot be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis outside of the clinical context  (

         Serum amylase and lipase – Elevation of amylase and/or lipase at least three times the upper limit of normal on several occasions, coupled with a characteristic episode of pain, supports a diagnosis of acute recurrent pancreatitis. However, lipase and amylase are made by tissues other than the pancreas and elevations do not always represent pancreatitis. Conversely, normal results for amylase and lipase do not exclude the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis.

         Fecal elastase – This is performed as a screening test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal elastase &lt;100 mcg/g stool suggests exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (although higher thresholds are sometimes used for patients with a high risk for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, such as cystic fibrosis). The test should not be performed during an episode of acute pancreatitis, because results may be temporarily low. Similarly, the test should not be performed in a patient with diarrhea, because levels will be falsely low due to dilution.

          Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)

          37,38

MRCP is the first choice since it is more readily available at most centers and can be done with sedation in most children, whereas EUS requires anesthesia. However, both EUS and MRCP may be valuable if a tumor is present in the pancreas, if there is ambiguity about the diagnosis after ERCP, or if an intervention is planned to biopsy the pancreas or drain a cyst.

          Pancreatic biopsy
         </strong>
         – There is a limited role for pancreatic biopsy in pediatric patients. The most common indications are for the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis and the evaluation of pancreatic masses. If indicated, a biopsy may be performed by a skilled interventional radiologist, surgeon, or skilled EUS operator. The choice of biopsy technique depends on the information sought and the availability of skilled providers.

         Chronic pancreatitis is a syndrome, so isolated features are not diagnostic. The diagnosis of acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis is made from a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, as outlined in a consensus statement  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109644" href="/z/d/graphic/109644.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic pancreatitis in advanced stages is typically diagnosed by the combination of functional and structural features:

         Other supporting evidence may include episodes of severe exacerbation with amylase or lipase elevations, evidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (low fecal elastase or high fecal fat), or endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (diabetes mellitus). Imaging studies alone are not diagnostic, especially in early stages of the syndrome. If chronic pancreatitis is suspected but initial imaging is normal, it may be necessary to follow the child for a time to confirm the diagnosis.

          —
         </span>
         Further evaluation to determine the cause or contributing risk factors for the chronic pancreatitis is directed by the results of the initial evaluation. The main considerations are listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65173" href="/z/d/graphic/65173.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Pathogenic genetic variants in multiple susceptibility genes are common in children with unexplained acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis. Genetic testing should be performed in children with early chronic pancreatitis to define the etiology, classify the patients by syndrome and disease mechanisms, and guide future management. Other tests listed below are selected based upon suspicion for specific risk factors.

         Testing for genetic risk factors is important because these are found in a high proportion of children with chronic pancreatitis [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,32,41
         </a>
         ]. Genetic factors may interact with other risk factors (for example, pancreas divisum, trauma, or toxic/metabolic causes) in the development of chronic pancreatitis [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Genetic counseling is useful before testing to counsel the patient and family, assure that the correct testing is performed, and interpret the results for the patent and family. Genetic testing may be helpful in predicting the future course of the disease, counseling family members and, in some cases, increasing confidence in the diagnosis. It should be noted that some of the genetic risk factors occur at high frequency in the general population, so the finding of these mutations in the absence of clinical and radiographic abnormalities should not be construed as confirming the diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Counseling can include discussion about the risk of smoking or alcohol use, which can trigger or exacerbate the pancreatitis. The counseling may include information about the complications of chronic pancreatitis, including development of diabetes and increased risk of pancreatic cancer. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5648.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis"

        </p>
        <p>
         Candidates for testing should be evaluated for mutations in each of the following genes, noting that the number of genes associated with acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis continues to grow. Evaluation of each gene is valuable, even for patients whose family is known to have a mutation in genes contributing to the risk of chronic pancreatitis, since the genetic model is often compound-complex with modifying factors and does not follow classic Mendelian patterns [

         Early referral to an expert in acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis is important to management. Management involves treating pain, ensuring adequate nutrition to preserve normal function and growth, and monitoring for complications of the disease. Patients experience exacerbations of disease that may resemble episodes of acute pancreatitis. Creating a specific plan for managing exacerbations helps to avoid unnecessary imaging studies and delay in pain management by other clinicians who may be unfamiliar with chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis. Treatment of chronic pancreatitis is detailed in a separate topic review (see

         Patients with abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis and dilated main pancreatic duct may benefit from endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) or other surgical procedures to relieve the obstruction. The role of endoscopic versus surgical intervention has not been well established in either adults or children; however, most practitioners would perform ERCP to relieve obstruction before considering surgical drainage. Management in children is based on expert opinion, guided by indirect evidence from adults with chronic pancreatitis and a few small case series in children. Therapeutic ERCP in children requires special expertise and is generally available only at major medical centers. Therapeutic ERCP for pancreas divisum is particularly difficult and controversial; consultation with an expert interventional pancreatologist is important before considering this option. (See

         Screening for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Measurement of fecal elastase is the simplest test for this purpose.

         Screening for endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus). An oral glucose tolerance test is the best test for endocrine insufficiency but may be too invasive or time consuming early in the course of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. Hemoglobin A1c, with or without a fasting glucose, is used as a screening test by some. This may not be the most sensitive test but may be acceptable, particularly in patients with preserved exocrine function.

        <p>
         The tiered program should be clearly communicated to the family and managed by the parents/caregivers. Children should not control their own home medications, regardless of age. It is helpful to develop a specific plan for pain management in the event of hospitalization and include it in the medical record to facilitate early relief of pain during an exacerbation. The pain team can also develop treatment plans for hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain and educate families on these symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other factors may contribute to the child's distress and should be evaluated and specifically addressed. These include nonpancreatic sources of pain, such as constipation and musculoskeletal pain. Depression and anxiety are common among children with chronic pain, and treatment may improve the child's quality of life and ability to cope with the illness. Social engagement, a regular daytime schedule, and distraction are often beneficial; for this reason, it is often helpful to keep the child in school as much as possible rather than changing to homeschooling, although individual families' decisions must be respected.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence for other agents improving pain in chronic pancreatitis, including pancreatic enzymes in a pancreatic-sufficient patient and antioxidant therapy, is controversial. A trial of non-enteric-coated PERT is reasonable, but its efficacy is unproven.

         Children who develop significant weight loss, reduced body mass index, or stunting of linear growth or who have severe disease and many hospital admissions may benefit from nasogastric or nasojejunal feedings. This strategy helps to improve weight gain and weight maintenance and may also improve pain.

         Patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis may develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which may contribute to growth failure and is identified by low levels of fecal elastase, as described above (see

          'Laboratory testing'

         A crucial decision in the care of a child with acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis is referral for surgery. Children with intractable pain, particularly when it interferes with school or other activities, and children with evidence of pancreatic duct obstruction unresponsive to ERCP may be considered for pancreatic drainage procedures (eg, Peustow, Frye, etc) or total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation. Because of the long life expected for children, and the potential complications of either procedure, referral to a center experienced in the care of children with pancreatitis is warranted. (See

         – Acute recurrent pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis are progressive inflammatory disorders of the pancreas, characterized by irreversible structural changes that often result in pain syndromes. They are distinguished by frequency of symptoms and presence or absence of irreversible changes in the pancreas or pancreatic function  (

          Clinical manifestations

         – The most common presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and poor growth. Less commonly, patients may be asymptomatic or present only after developing signs of pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency (eg, malabsorption, particularly of fat and fat-soluble vitamins, or diabetes), which occurs late in the course.

          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The first step in evaluating a child with suspected chronic pancreatitis is a focused history and physical examination to help distinguish this disorder from other causes of abdominal pain. If this evaluation is consistent with pancreatitis, further steps include laboratory testing and imaging. Early referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is valuable in guiding the evaluation and management.

          Laboratory tests
         </strong>
         – Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count (CBC), liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase. Normal results for amylase and lipase do not exclude the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. Elevation of amylase and/or lipase at least three times the upper limit of normal supports a diagnosis of acute recurrent pancreatitis if it coincides with a characteristic episode of pain. The patient should also be evaluated for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by measuring fecal elastase and for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Chronic pancreatitis is most commonly diagnosed by the combination of abdominal pain consistent with pancreatic origin (particularly if exacerbated by meals) and imaging findings demonstrating pancreatic atrophy, calcifications, increased diameter of the pancreatic duct, or other ductal abnormalities. Combinations of findings that can be used to make the diagnosis of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis are outlined in the table  (

          Management
         </strong>
         – Management of chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis involves managing pain and nutrition to preserve normal function and growth as well as monitoring for complications of the disease, including psychosocial stress. Pain should be managed with a tiered program that includes nonmedication strategies, nonopioid medications, and carefully planned use of opioids. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nutrition'
         </a>

         Patients with abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis and dilated main pancreatic duct may benefit from ERCP to relieve the obstruction. Surgical options may be indicated in select cases. (See
