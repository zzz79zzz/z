         The clinical manifestations of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) vary depending upon the presence and severity of associated valve dysfunction. The valve dysfunction caused by PVT is predominantly obstruction (stenosis) and rarely regurgitation. Clinical manifestations in patients with PVT and/or obstruction range from an incidentally detected change in valve appearance or valve gradient observed on an echocardiogram performed for other reasons, a change in mechanical prosthetic valve closing clicks (which may be noticed by the patient as well as by clinicians), thromboembolism, symptoms and signs of heart failure (HF) caused by valve dysfunction (eg, dyspnea, fatigue, pulmonary crackles, cardiogenic shock), presyncope or syncope, and, rarely, sudden death [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms and signs of a thromboembolic event may occur with or without valve obstruction. Left-sided PVT (mitral or aortic) may cause systemic embolic events such as stroke, peripheral embolism, or, rarely, myocardial infarction [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Right-sided (tricuspid or pulmonic) PVT may cause pulmonary emboli; tricuspid PVT can also result in systemic emboli via paradoxical embolization.

         Initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, an international normalized ratio (INR), and blood cultures. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also performed in patients presenting with HF, embolic event, or signs of an acute coronary syndrome.

         If the hemoglobin level is low, evaluation of anemia should include a hemolysis work-up (assessment of the peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, and haptoglobin levels), as discussed separately. (See

         Recent and current INR results should be checked. In patients with a mechanical valve, a subtherapeutic INR prior to or at the time of presentation raises the index of suspicion for valve thrombosis or thromboembolism [

         An ECG is indicated in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of HF (eg, dyspnea, edema), an acute coronary syndrome (eg, chest pain), or stroke. The ECG is generally nondiagnostic in patients with PVT or thromboembolism. However, the ECG may help identify other causes of symptoms, such as an acute coronary syndrome or arrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation). As noted above, coronary thromboembolism from a prosthetic valve is a rare cause of myocardial infarction. (See

         PVT and/or obstruction should be suspected in a patient with a prosthetic valve presenting with a change in mechanical prosthetic valve closing clicks, a new murmur, or symptoms and signs of HF that may be caused by valve dysfunction (eg, dyspnea, fatigue, pulmonary crackles, syncope, cardiogenic shock). In some patients, the first sign of PVT or obstruction is an incidentally detected change in valve appearance (restricted leaflet motion with leaflet thickening or mass) and/or increased valve gradient observed on an echocardiogram performed for other reasons. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113815.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Prosthetic valve thromboembolism should be suspected in a patient with a prosthetic valve presenting with a stroke or other thromboembolic event. However, since thromboembolism in a patient with a prosthetic valve may or may not originate from the prosthesis, other causes should also be evaluated, as described below. (See

         As an initial step in evaluating patients with suspected PVT, obstruction, or thromboembolism, we suggest imaging by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE):

         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         A key component of the TTE evaluation is measurement of the prosthetic mean transvalvular pressure gradient to determine whether there is significant valve obstruction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113815.html" rel="external">

         A TTE evaluation should also include assessment of prosthetic valve appearance, identification of the presence and severity of prosthetic regurgitation (transvalvular or paravalvular), assessment of left and right ventricular function, and identification of other possible sources of emboli (eg, left ventricular apical thrombus) compared with prior postoperative baseline TTE. TTE sometimes enables preliminary visualization of prosthetic disc motion and thickening or thrombus  (

         TTE is the generally preferred test for assessment of prosthetic valve gradients; in some cases with suboptimal TTE results, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be helpful in assessing the prosthetic valve gradients. (See

         Valve obstruction may be suspected clinically when new symptoms or physical examination findings are identified. A mean transvalvular pressure gradient by echocardiography that has elevated by &gt;50 percent compared with baseline (or by a mean gradient ≥20 mmHg or an increase in mean gradient ≥10 mmHg for an aortic prosthesis [

         If a prior postoperative baseline TTE is not available for comparison, a prosthetic valve gradient above established normal values (above the 95% CI) for valves of that type and size (eg, normal values compiled in the 2009 American Society of Echocardiography

         The clinical manifestations and initial evaluation of prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction is detailed separately. Briefly, patients suspected of having PVT and/or obstruction should undergo clinical evaluation for any related symptoms or signs and TTE including determination of whether prosthetic valve obstruction is present. Prosthetic valve obstruction is identified as a mean transvalvular gradient increase by &gt;50 percent (or &gt;10 mmHg increase for an aortic prosthesis) compared with baseline, after exclusion of other causes such as a high-output state.

         The urgency of further evaluation is based upon the clinical setting. Urgent multimodality imaging is recommended for patients with suspected PVT and/or prosthetic valve obstruction with moderate to severe symptoms (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV).

         TEE enables assessment of prosthetic valve disc appearance, motion and function (obstruction and regurgitation), features of thrombus, and alternate causes of emboli. Three-dimensional (3D) TEE is suggested when available, as it may detect prosthetic thrombi that are missed or only partially visualized by two-dimensional (2D) TEE [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         TEE is helpful in the assessment of mechanical mitral valves because thrombus is often located on the left atrial side of the valve and thus may be seen on TEE imaging. However, TEE is less useful for evaluation of mechanical aortic valve prostheses (particularly bileaflet valves and when more than one mechanical prosthesis is in place) because the posterior aspect of the valve shadows the valve itself in esophageal views. Transgastric views are often most helpful for assessing prosthetic aortic disc motion.
        </p>
        <p>
         If there are indeterminate TEE findings (eg, absence of mass in a patient with an aortic valve prosthesis, presence of an intermediate or high intensity ratio mass, or suboptimally visualized mitral valve prosthesis), then MDCT may be helpful in visualizing thrombus or pannus.

         Fluoroscopy provides a reliable assessment of mechanical disc motion but does not enable assessment of soft tissue (eg, thrombus or pannus) associated with the valve. Valve fluoroscopy is generally performed in the catheterization laboratory and should be done by an experienced operator. Fluoroscopy or TEE may be used to evaluate Bjork-Shiley or Sorin monodisc motion, but TEE is generally preferred as it may additionally enable visualization of mass on the disc.

         A definitive tissue diagnosis of a mass attached to the prosthesis (eg, thrombus, pannus, or vegetation) cannot be made on an imaging test (TEE, MDCT, fluoroscopy), and ultimately it is the clinical context that helps guide diagnosis and therapy. For patients presenting with abnormal prosthetic valve appearance or mobility, it is important to exclude the presence of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). PVE generally presents with signs and symptoms of invasive infection; clinical manifestations and diagnosis are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2138.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         If imaging and clinical findings support a diagnosis of PVE (eg, presence of vegetations and bacteremia with typical bacteria), then appropriate management including antimicrobial therapy is indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a diagnosis of PVE is uncertain, follow-up testing (eg, repeat TEE in one week) is recommended to determine whether or not PVE is present. PET-CT is emerging as a useful imaging modality in assessment of endocarditis. (See

         In patients presenting with prosthetic valve obstruction, once endocarditis has been excluded it is important to distinguish thrombus from pannus given the differences in treatment options. In some cases, pannus and thrombus may both contribute to valve obstruction. The evaluation of mechanical valve obstruction is closely linked to management since some therapies (such as fibrinolysis or valve surgery) may both identify the cause of prosthetic valve obstruction and treat it.

         Initial evaluation of patients suspected of having mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) and/or obstruction should include clinical assessment of symptoms and signs and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with determination of whether prosthetic valve obstruction is present. (See

         Prosthetic valve obstruction is defined as mean transvalvular gradient increase by &gt;50 percent (or &gt;10 mmHg increase for an aortic prosthesis) compared with baseline, after exclusion of other causes such as a high-output state. (See

         Further evaluation of mechanical valve thrombosis and/or obstruction includes further imaging of the mechanical valve by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and/or multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), exclusion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, and determining whether imaging findings are consistent with PVT. For patients with a thromboembolic event, comprehensive evaluation for alternative causes should be conducted. (See

         The choice between TEE and MDCT as the next imaging test after TTE is made based upon availability, prior test results, patient characteristics, mechanical valve type/location, and clinician experience. (See

         For patients with suspected mechanical valve thrombosis with no significant obstruction, imaging is performed to confirm whether or not thrombus is present. (See
         <a class="local">
          'For valve thrombosis without obstruction'
         </a>
         above.)
