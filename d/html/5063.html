BIND includes acute and chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE and CBE, respectively) as well as more subtle neurologic dysfunction. The manifestations of BIND, including ABE and CBE, are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4994.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and neurologic complications", section on 'Consequences of severe hyperbilirubinemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Assessment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is based upon total bilirubin rather than unconjugated bilirubin levels alone because neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is mostly due to increased bilirubin production, resulting primarily in unconjugated bilirubin. Cholestasis, which presents with primarily elevated conjugated (direct) bilirubin, is a rare cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5020.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates: Etiology and pathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5945.html" rel="external">"Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GOALS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of managing neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are to prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin-induced neurologic disorders (BIND) while avoiding unnecessary interventions which can interfere with successful initiation of breastfeeding and parent/caregiver bonding with the newborn. Thus, the treatment thresholds discussed below are meant to reflect the point at which the benefits of treatment likely exceed potential downsides [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Thresholds for treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The decision of when to initiate and escalate therapy is based upon the newborn's risk of developing severe hyperbilirubinemia and BIND. The most important risk factor for BIND is the severity and duration of bilirubin exposure. Additional risk factors are summarized in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64584" href="/d/graphic/64584.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139425" href="/d/graphic/139425.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4994.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and neurologic complications", section on 'Risk factors for neurotoxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), and the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Links to these and other society guidelines are provided separately. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4065889444"><span class="h1">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Newborns with hyperbilirubinemia should receive adequate nutrition and hydration since this enhances bilirubin elimination. Maintaining adequate urine output is critical for newborns receiving phototherapy since its principal mechanism involves excreting lumirubin (the main photoproduct of bilirubin) in the urine. (See <a class="local">'Initial intervention (phototherapy)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H408732390"><span class="h2">Feeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Breastfeeding is encouraged for newborns with hyperbilirubinemia, as it is for all newborns. The benefits of breastfeeding are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5013.html" rel="external">"Infant benefits of breastfeeding"</a>.)</p><p>Key aspects of optimizing feeding include promoting human milk feeding, enhancing maternal milk production, and avoiding excessive weight loss (defined as &gt;10 percent of birth weight (BW) in the first few days after birth) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These issues are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding"</a>.)</p><p>For breastfed infants with inadequate intake, excessive weight loss (&gt;10 percent of BW), and/or who evidence of hypovolemia, supplemental feeds should be provided with human milk, either expressed maternal milk (preferred) or pasteurized donor milk [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Formula supplementation is discouraged but may be used if these preferred sources of human milk are not available or not chosen. Enteral feeding is preferred over intravenous (IV) hydration because it enhances excretion of bilirubin through enterohepatic circulation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding", section on 'Assessment of intake'</a>.)</p><p>During phototherapy, newborns should continue oral feedings by breast, bottle, or other methods (eg, cup). Breastfeeding may need to be temporarily halted if the newborn's total serum or plasma bilirubin (TSB) level is very elevated. If this occurs, bottle feedings should be provided and breastfeeding should be resumed as soon as possible once the TSB improves. (See <a class="local">'Technique'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1786157616"><span class="h2">Intravenous hydration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most newborns with hyperbilirubinemia do <strong>not </strong>require IV hydration since oral feeding with or without supplementation generally provides adequate hydration. However, for newborns with dehydration, hypovolemia, and/or hypernatremia due to inadequate oral intake, IV hydration may be necessary [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In addition, we suggest IV hydration for newborns who require an escalated level of care (ie, those who have TSB levels at or approaching the threshold for exchange transfusion), as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121592.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm newborns: Escalation of care", section on 'IV hydration'</a>.)</p><p>Initial correction of hypovolemia consists of a 10 to 20 mL/kg bolus of isotonic fluids (eg, normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a>). If required, ongoing IV hydration consists of crystalloid fluid (typically 10 percent dextrose with one-quarter normal saline) at a maintenance rate (ie, 60 to 80 mL/kg per day for newborns &lt;48 hours old; 80 to 100 mL/kg per day for those ≥48 hours old). Subsequent adjustments are based on measurement of serum electrolytes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5065.html" rel="external">"Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H177527417"><span class="h1">THRESHOLDS FOR TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H521593573"><span class="h2">Symptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Newborns with elevated total serum or plasma bilirubin (TSB) levels in association with signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) generally require escalation of care and exchange transfusion. Signs and symptoms of ABE include lethargy, hyper- or hypotonia, poor suck, high-pitched cry, recurrent apnea, opisthotonos, retrocollis, seizures  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122620" href="/d/graphic/122620.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Symptomatic newborns require escalation of care even if the TSB level is not above the threshold for exchange transfusion. Phototherapy should be provided while preparations are made to perform exchange transfusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121592.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm newborns: Escalation of care"</a>.)</p><p>In newborns with signs of encephalopathy in the setting of TSB levels that are well below the treatment threshold, other etiologies should also be considered (eg, sepsis, hypoglycemia). ABE is unusual at TSB levels &lt;20 mg/dL (342 micromol/L); most reported cases of ABE have occurred at TSB levels ≥30 mg/dL (513 micromol/L). Thus, neurologic abnormalities (lethargy, poor tone, seizures, apnea) in a newborn with TSB &lt;20 mg/dL (342 micromol/L) are more likely to be caused by other conditions rather than ABE. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6216.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy", section on 'Investigations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4994.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and neurologic complications", section on 'Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2336646318"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has established hour-specific TSB thresholds for initiating treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

However, if the TcB level is above the treatment threshold, phototherapy should be initiated while awaiting confirmation.

It decreases or blunts the trajectory of TSB levels regardless of the etiology of hyperbilirubinemia [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. </p><p>The introduction of phototherapy in the latter half of the twentieth century represented a pivotal shift in the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and dramatically reduced rates of severe hyperbilirubinemia.

These thresholds are based largely upon expert opinion rather than definitive evidence.</p><p>It is important to recognize that the treatment thresholds in the 2022 AAP guidelines are higher than in previous guidelines. The updated guidelines assume that treatment will begin promptly. Delays in starting therapy are considerably more likely to result in dangerously high TSB levels compared with the earlier treatment approach.</p><p>Like any other therapeutic intervention, clinical judgment is required to ensure appropriate and correct dosing of phototherapy based on an individualized risk/benefit assessment for the newborn, thereby avoiding under- or overuse of phototherapy.

Other light sources include fluorescent tubes or halogen bulbs [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preferred light source:</strong> <strong>Blue LED lights</strong> – Blue LED lights (eg, Bilisoft 2.0 [General Electric], BiliTouch [Motif], Blue Spot PT [General Electric], neoBLUE [Natus], Skylife [Neolight]) use high-intensity gallium nitride gas that emit light at a peak wavelength of 470±10 nm. They are commercially available as overhead lights, beds/mattresses, and blankets/pads [<a href="#rid8">8,16,17</a>]. We prefer these devices over non-LED devices because blue LEDs deliver high intensity narrow-band light in the absorption spectrum of bilirubin without generating heat or emitting UV light. LED-based mattresses are preferable to pads or blankets because they are large enough to cover most of the BSA of a term infant. However, blankets can be used during feedings when exposure to overhead lighting is interrupted. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The available clinical trial evidence suggests that blue LED devices and non-LED-devices have comparable efficacy [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].

In another meta-analysis that included the same five trials plus one additional trial (total 630 newborns), the duration of phototherapy was similar in both groups [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

We generally prefer blue LED lights over these devices for the reasons outlined above. However, if a blue LED device is not available, fluorescent and halogen lights are acceptable alternatives. Fiberoptic blankets or pads generate little heat and can be placed close to the infant, providing higher irradiances than fluorescent lights [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].

Home phototherapy was particularly useful during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. However, the cost-effectiveness of appropriately prescribed home phototherapy has not been established.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of home phototherapy were evaluated in a clinical trial involving 147 newborns &gt;36 weeks gestation with treatment-level hyperbilirubinemia at &gt;48 hours postnatal age and without other clinical risk factors (ie, no hemolytic disease, infection, or other illness) who randomized to home or in-hospital phototherapy [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. TSB trajectories and duration of phototherapy were similar in both groups (median of 18 hours for both). Among patients randomized to home therapy, three patients (4 percent) required hospital admission for worsening hyperbilirubinemia; all instances were attributed to caregiver misunderstanding of the instructions for using the device. No infant in either group required exchange transfusion.</p><p>Similar findings have been noted in observational studies using similar criteria for selecting candidates for home phototherapy. In these studies, rehospitalization rates ranged from 0 to 6 percent and no newborns required exchange transfusion [<a href="#rid24">24,28-31</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1347282288"><span class="h2">Mechanism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The principal mechanism by which phototherapy reduces bilirubin levels is by irreversibly converting bilirubin primarily into lumirubin, which is not neurotoxic and is more soluble than bilirubin [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Lumirubin is then excreted without conjugation into bile and urine. The conversion is caused by direct exposure to photons emitted by the light source as bilirubin passes through superficial capillaries in the skin. Photo-alteration of bilirubin occurs at specific wavelengths of blue-to-blue-green light (460 to 490 nm, optimal at 478 nm). Other mechanisms that may account for a small proportion of bilirubin elimination include photo-oxidation to polar molecules and photoisomerization to the less toxic 4Z,15Z bilirubin isomer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3973617708"><span class="h2">General efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The efficacy of phototherapy for treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is supported by landmark clinical trials performed in the 1970s to 1980s [<a href="#rid10">10,11,33,34</a>] and by decades of clinical experience since that time. In the available randomized and nonrandomized trials comparing phototherapy to supportive care alone, phototherapy lowered TSB levels and reduced the need for exchange transfusion by approximately 10 to 25 percent [<a href="#rid10">10-12,35</a>]. Phototherapy's impact on reducing exchange transfusion in the modern era may be even greater. This is because current thresholds for performing exchange transfusion are considerably higher than during the earlier era when these studies were carried out. Thus, many patients who "failed" phototherapy and went on to exchange transfusion in these early studies would not be treated with exchange transfusion in the modern era. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121592.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm newborns: Escalation of care", section on 'Criteria for exchange transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>Limited data suggest that phototherapy may improve indirect measures of brain function in the short-term (eg, brainstem auditory evoked response [BAER]) [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>]. Data regarding phototherapy’s impact on long-term neurologic outcomes (eg, neurodevelopmental disability, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy [CBE; previously referred to as kernicterus]), are limited and inconclusive [<a href="#rid35">35,38,39</a>]. </p><p>Despite the lack of conclusive evidence directly linking phototherapy to a reduction in CBE, it is reasonable to surmise that phototherapy likely reduces risk of CBE since CBE occurs exclusively in neonates with extreme/hazardous hyperbilirubinemia and phototherapy effectively prevents such high levels [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].

The use of fiberoptic blankets can minimize interruptions in breastfeeding during the birth hospitalization. In an observational study of 4441 infants from a national registry, phototherapy had minimal effects on future breastfeeding [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Although phototherapy was associated with a decrease in exclusive breastfeeding during the first four months of life, there were similar rates of any breastfeeding up to nine months of age for infants who received phototherapy versus those who did not.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bronze baby syndrome</strong> – Bronze baby syndrome is an uncommon reversible skin condition manifested by a transient dark, grayish-brown discoloration of the skin and urine [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. It occurs in infants with cholestatic jaundice (conjugated bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dL) treated with phototherapy and is caused by integumentary deposition of bronze-colored pigments, mainly due to photoisomers [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. There is no known neurotoxicity associated with this syndrome; it usually resolves without sequelae within weeks after discontinuation of phototherapy as the pigments are slowly eliminated [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Thus, there is no contraindication to the use of phototherapy in infants with dual or mixed hyperbilirubinemia (ie, due to both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin). However, experts in the field have cautioned against the use phototherapy for infants with predominantly conjugated bilirubin (&gt;50 percent of the TSB level), as there is no observed benefit of phototherapy in infants with excessive cholestasis (high direct bilirubin). Bronze baby syndrome is not an indication for an exchange transfusion nor an indication to withhold phototherapy for those at imminent risk for developing ABE. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other reported short-term adverse effects of phototherapy are due mostly to the effects of UV light and increased heat produced by older devices that use fluorescent or halogen lights [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

The overall adjusted risk of experiencing seizures by age 10 years was 2.4 per 1000 children for children who received neonatal phototherapy; the risk was higher for boys compared with girls (3.7 per 1000 boys versus 0.8 per 1000 girls). There was no apparent association between phototherapy and febrile seizures.

However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding this association since it is challenging to adequately control for confounding factors (eg, severity of hyperbilirubinemia, exposure to direct sunlight). In addition, many studies did not differentiate between different types of light source, some of which do not filter out UV radiation.

A subsequent study from the same healthcare network included 139,000 children (GA ≥35 weeks) born between 1995 to 2017 and used propensity score analysis in attempt to better adjust for confounding variables. In this study, phototherapy did not appear to be independently associated with increased risk of cancer over a mean follow-up of eight years (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83-1.15) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A study that used linked state-wide data from California with follow-up to one year of age from 1998 to 2007 demonstrated that cancer was diagnosed more frequently for infants with diagnostic codes for phototherapy compared with those without such codes (33 versus 21 per 100,000 patients, relative risk [RR] 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0) [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].
