Individualized assessment and frequent reassessment of the adequacy of oxygenation is required (see <a class="local">'Measurement of oxygenation'</a> below). The inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) should be monitored with an oxygen analyzer, if possible. </p><p>The following sections describe the various respiratory support and oxygen delivery devices commonly used in neonates.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3334630001"><span class="h2">Choice of modality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of respiratory and oxygen delivery device is dependent on the clinical setting and the needs of the individual neonate. In our center, we base the choice on the gestational age (GA) of the neonate, the underlying respiratory condition, and the phase of illness (ie, initial support versus following extubation). Our general approach is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Very preterm infants (VPT; GA &lt;32 weeks) </strong>– For VPT infants who are at risk for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), nCPAP is our preferred initial primary respiratory support, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'Noninvasive positive airway pressure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate preterm infants</strong> <strong>(GA 32 to &lt;34 weeks) </strong>– For moderate preterm infants, the initial respiratory support depends upon the degree of respiratory distress. For infants who display respiratory distress (tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring), nCPAP is the preferred respiratory support system as these infants may be at risk for RDS. For infants with hypoxemia without respiratory distress, LFNC is usually sufficient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Late preterm and term infants (GA ≥34 weeks) </strong>– For late preterm and term infants, the modality depends upon the underlying diagnosis. Positive pressure typically is not necessary unless there is considerable intrinsic lung disease. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Transient tachypnea of the newborn ‒ In this setting, oxygen supplementation is provided by hood or LFNC to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;90 percent.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/135094.html" rel="external">"Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN): Management and outcome", section on 'Respiratory support'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Following extubation</strong> – We typically use nCPAP when managing infants who have been intubated and mechanically ventilated for a period of time and who are at risk for requiring reintubation following extubation. We prefer nCPAP over HFNC and NIPPV because there is greater experience and familiarity with this modality, particularly in VPT infants. The available data suggest that all three modalities are effective in preventing reintubation. These data are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'Post-extubation support'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For preterm infants with advancing age who continue to require supplemental oxygen following extubation and who poorly tolerate the CPAP nasal prongs, HFNC or LFNC are reasonable alternative methods for oxygen delivery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Low-flow nasal cannula'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Low-flow nasal cannula</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>LFNC provides oxygen through two soft prongs that are inserted into the patient's anterior nares (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113273" href="/z/d/graphic/113273.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Oxygen flows from the cannula into the patient's nasopharynx and mixes with room air entering from the infant's mouth and nose. Consequently, there is considerable variability is the effective FiO2 delivered to the lungs with LFNC due to variability in respiratory rate, oxygen flow rate, extent of mouth breathing, and size of the nasopharynx [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>In neonates, LFNC is typically provided with unblended oxygen at flow rates &lt;1 L/min, which provides no or minimal positive pressure (&lt;1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). Alternatively, LFNC can be used with a blender to administer a lower oxygen concentration (FiO2 0.25 to 0.4) at a higher flow rate (1 to 2 L/min). The effective oxygen concentration the lungs receive will be lower than the FiO2 setting on the air/oxygen blender. In preterm infants, the latter approach is commonly used when transitioning from nCPAP to LFNC. The benefit of this approach is that it provides a small amount of positive airway pressure (approximately 1 to 3 cm H2O) without exposing the neonate to high oxygen concentrations [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>There are established formulas to estimate the effective delivered FiO2 based upon patient size, oxygen concentration, and flow rate [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, these formulas are rarely used in clinical practice because they are cumbersome and they provide only a rough estimate. It is simpler to just assume that the effective FiO2 delivered by LFNC is lower than prescribed and, in some cases, almost equivalent to room air [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2812660725"><span class="h2">Other oxygen delivery systems</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2602289006"><span class="h3">Hood</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An oxygen hood is a high-flow, high-concentration oxygen system (7 to 15 L/min) that uses a hard plastic or soft tent-like structure or dome that fits over the infant's head (if in an incubator) or over the body (if in a crib) (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113268" href="/z/d/graphic/113268.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Hoods are not routinely used for oxygen delivery in neonates, since they limit access to the infant's face and head. They are generally used only in settings when a cannula is not tolerated.</p><p>Oxygen enters the hood through a gas inlet. Oxygen concentrations of 80 to 90 percent can be achieved with oxygen flow rates ≥10 to 15 L/min. Exhaled gas exits through the opening at the neck [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. A pass-over system is used to humidify the oxygen to prevent drying of the skin and inspired gas. In preterm neonates &lt;1500 g, the oxygen is heated to the same temperature as the incubator. In larger infants, room temperature is maintained within the hood to prevent tachypnea.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2391528205"><span class="h3">Face mask</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A face mask used for oxygen delivery is rarely used beyond the delivery room resuscitation. However, a mask is occasionally used to deliver free-flow oxygen as a temporary measure during periods of oxygen desaturation or prior to endotracheal intubation. The distance of the mask from the face affects the delivered FiO<sub>2 </sub>. If a mask is employed for the resolution of apnea, every effort would be made to mirror the FiO<sub>2</sub> that is used prior to the episode.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1240213410"><span class="h3">Servo-control incubator</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stable oxygen concentration can be achieved in a servo-controlled incubator. In preterm infants receiving supplemental oxygen, a small single-center trial reported episodes of hypoxemia were lower when using a servo-controlled environment compared with the use of a nasal cannulae to deliver [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H311067866"><span class="h2">High-flow nasal cannula</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HFNC delivers heated, humidified air at flow rates that are higher than standard LFNC. The flow rate and FiO<sub>2</sub> are set by the clinician. Typical initial flow rates for neonates are 4 to 6 L/min up to maximum of 8 L/min. At these flow rates, the amount of positive airway pressure provided by HFNC ranges from 2 to 5 cm H2O [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>HFNC may be used as an alternative to nCPAP in the following settings [<a href="#rid1">1,8,9</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Apnea of prematurity (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5048.html" rel="external">"Management of apnea of prematurity", section on 'High flow nasal cannula'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Primary mode of respiratory support in preterm infants with RDS (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'High-flow nasal cannula'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Following extubation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'Post-extubation support'</a>)</p><p></p><p>The theoretical benefit of HFNC is that the high flow rate washes out nasopharyngeal dead space and replaces the end-expiratory gas within the upper airway with fresh oxygenated and humidified gas [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In addition, the nasal cannulae used for HFNC are smaller than the nasal prongs used for nCPAP and they are easier to apply and associated with less nasal trauma [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, there is greater variability in the amount of positive airway pressure provided with HFNC compared with nCPAP [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. For this reason, and because there is greater experience with nCPAP, many centers, including our own, preferentially use nCPAP for initial management of VPT infants. HFNC is a reasonable alternative for neonates who do not tolerate nCPAP and those who develop problematic nasal trauma on nCPAP. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'Noninvasive positive airway pressure'</a>.)</p><p>HFNC can also be used to provide apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation in non-emergency situations (ie, when time and resources allow for setting up the HFNC system). The aim of HFNC use in this setting is to maintain cardiorespiratory stability during the procedure and allow more time for successful intubation. In a trial involving 209 preterm neonates undergoing 258 non-emergency intubations (most patients were on CPAP prior to intubation), HFNC use throughout the procedure improved the likelihood of successful first-attempt intubation compared with no supplemental oxygen (68 versus 54 percent; adjusted risk difference [aRD] 15.8, 95% CI 4.3–27.3) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In addition, episodes of desaturation and/or bradycardia occurred less commonly in the HFNC group (36 versus 50 percent; aRD 13.4, 95% CI 1.3-25.5). The practice of using HFNC (or other devices) for apneic oxygenation during neonatal and pediatric intubation is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117124.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for pediatric anesthesia", section on 'Apneic oxygenation'</a>.)</p><p>Each HFNC system requires a specific humidification device and cannula that are not interchangeable between systems. Adequate heating and humidification is necessary for each HFNC system [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. HFNC prongs are smaller in length and diameter than those used for nCPAP and do not require a seal to operate. HFNC prongs should occupy no more than 50 percent of the internal diameter of the nares to permit sufficient leak and protection from high pressure [<a href="#rid8">8,14</a>]. The cannulae should <strong>not </strong>occlude the nares since this can generate high nasopharyngeal pressure and can potentially cause traumatic air dissection [<a href="#rid8">8,10</a>]. </p><p>Additional details regarding HFNC are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122550.html" rel="external">"High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H705751490"><span class="h2">Continuous positive airway pressure</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H899102063"><span class="h3">Clinical application</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>nCPAP is our preferred modality for initial respiratory support in preterm neonates with RDS or apnea. It is also commonly used for respiratory support following extubation. nCPAP is thought to be effective by splinting the pharyngeal airway with positive pressure, thereby maintaining lung recruitment and reducing the risk of upper airway collapse and obstruction (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113276" href="/z/d/graphic/113276.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Use of nCPAP in these clinical settings is discussed in detail separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initial respiratory support for VPT neonates (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4992.html" rel="external">"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Prevention", section on 'Ventilation strategies to minimize lung injury'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Management of apnea of prematurity (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5048.html" rel="external">"Management of apnea of prematurity", section on 'Nasal continuous positive airway pressure'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postextubation respiratory support (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4997.html" rel="external">"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants: Management", section on 'Post-extubation support'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3061421370"><span class="h3">CPAP systems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CPAP is administered through nasal prongs or mask through a variety of systems (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113276" href="/z/d/graphic/113276.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). </p><p>CPAP can be delivered using different systems, which are broadly categorized as fluidic (variable flow) CPAP, constant flow CPAP, and bubble CPAP. In our center, we use the fluidic (variable flow) system because it allows rapid transition from inspiration to expiration and this may reduce work of breathing, especially in smaller infants. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluidic CPAP, also known as variable flow CPAP, uses two individual flow paths, one each for inspiration and expiration. An inlet port supplies fresh gas flow that enters one of the two separate flow paths, converts energy to pressure, and delivers constant pressure through nasal prongs or a mask to the airway. On exhalation, gas exits the system though an exhaust tubing (opposing path) that imposes little to no resistance, making exhalation easy. Because of the availability of the two individual flow paths, transition between inspiratory and expiratory phases occurs quickly and reduces the work of breathing, especially in VPT infants (GA ≤32 weeks) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Constant flow systems use a standard nasal prong or mask interface attached to a standard ventilator circuit. The level of CPAP is controlled by the ventilator settings and the bias flow (the amount of flow left in the circuit during exhalation). Advanced ventilator technology incorporates algorithms that respond to the patient's need or demand for flow. In some cases, if the patient needs higher flow because they are "flow starved," such as in neonates with respiratory distress; the demand valve of the ventilator opens and allows for higher flows to achieve the desired CPAP. Most ventilators deliver constant pressure to achieve CPAP. However, in low birth weight (BW) infants, minimum or smaller respiratory efforts in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are sometimes not recognized by the ventilator, making it less responsive to their needs, and thus making this system less favorable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bubble CPAP is a constant-flow variable pressure system that incorporates a standard nasal prong or mask interface attached to a dual-limb heated and humidified circuit. It is the least expensive system, is commonly used in level 2 and 3 neonatal care units, and is easy to initiate in the delivery room. Inspiratory flow is provided from a blended gas source while the expiratory side of the circuit is submersed into a water column. These low flows prevent buildup of back pressure in the system, making it a safe application for neonates. The desired level of CPAP in cm H<sub>2</sub>0 is determined by not only the depth of the tubing within the water column but also the amount of flow powering the system. Continuous bubbling requires a base flow rate of 4 to 8 L per minute depending on the type of system used. Bubble CPAP systems' characteristics vary, so careful attention to both the depth and the flow are important factors to consider. CPAP pressure is measured with a pressure manometer to determine the actual pressure delivered. Gas flow is responsible for bubbling in the circuit and produces mini oscillations generated within the chest that can equate to nearly 5 to 20 Hz at average CPAP levels [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3004296360"><span class="h3">Initial settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our center, we administer nCPAP with an initial pressure level of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 and then increase to 6 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 as needed.

It is delivered via nasal prongs or mask using a mechanical ventilator [<a href="#rid10">10,16</a>]. The peak inspiratory pressure, expiratory pressure, and breath rate are set by the clinician. Breaths are time-cycled and pressure- or flow-limited; the size of the breath is determined by the difference between the inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Clinical trials evaluating NIPPV in neonates have used a wide range of set peak inspiratory pressures (10 to 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), breath rates (10 to 60 breaths per minute), and inspiratory times (0.3 to 0.5 seconds) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>As with invasive MV, NIPPV can be delivered either as synchronized or nonsynchronized breaths. However, synchronization is difficult to achieve in with noninvasive ventilation in neonates [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], and there are few devices that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for delivery of synchronized NIPPV in neonates.

Inadequate flow will not overcome the back pressure in the ventilator system and can result in insufficient pressure being delivered to the infant such that there may be little to no tidal volume. This can occur despite the ventilator indicating adequate measured pressure on the display. </p><p>Abdominal distention has been observed in patients managed by NIPPV but the rate of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) appears to be similar to that in patients receiving nCPAP.

However, breath delivery is triggered by a signal from the electrical activity of the diaphragm rather than flow sensing on the ventilator. As such, NIV-NAVA is not affected by leaks around the interface and the delivered breaths more closely match the infant's spontaneous effort. Like NIPPV, NIV-NAVA has been used in neonates who fail nCPAP in attempt to reduce the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. In our practice, we more commonly use NIPPV in this setting; however, in some centers routinely use NIV-NAVA.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The available data on NIV-NAVA in preterm neonates are limited to a few small clinical trials and observational studies [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]. Based upon these limited data, NIV-NAVA appears to have similar efficacy compared to other modes of NIV (eg, nCPAP, NIPPV) efficacy. In a trial involving 20 preterm neonates randomized immediately after birth to NIV-NAVA or nCPAP, both groups had similar work of breathing, rates of intubation, and days on respiratory support [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In another trial involving 30 mechanically ventilated preterm neonates who were randomized to NIV-NAVA or NIPPV after elective extubation, neonates on NIV-NAVA required lower peak pressures over the first three days [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. More neonates in the NIV-NAVA group remain extubated by day five (92 versus 69 percent); however, this finding was not statistically significant.
