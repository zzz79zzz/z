         Amphetamines first appeared as a nasal decongestant in the form of a Benzedrine inhaler and were then used by the military as agents to promote alertness in battle-fatigued troops. In the 1950s, they gained popularity as weight-loss drugs and shortly thereafter became popular substances of abuse. Amphetamine sulfate and other stimulants like ephedra have a long history of abuse in the United States. Cathinones are beta-ketone amphetamine analogs. Abuse of the new synthetic cathinones (bath salts) emerged in Europe in 2009 and spread to the United States in 2010 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]; these drugs were initially marketed in the United States as "bath salts" or "plant food" to avoid restrictions under the United States Controlled Substances Act.

         Phenethylamines, including traditional amphetamines and the newer synthetic compounds, share multiple pharmacodynamic properties. Stimulation of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors is primarily responsible for the acute effects of amphetamines, which include hyper-alertness, hypertension, tachycardia, mydriasis, and diaphoresis. Together, these symptoms are part of the sympathomimetic toxic syndrome (or toxidrome)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268" href="/z/d/graphic/71268.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Adrenergic receptors are reviewed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1619.html" rel="external">
          "Use of vasopressors and inotropes", section on 'Physiologic mechanisms of vasoconstriction'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Phenylethylamines cause the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine and may also inhibit their reuptake. Some cause the release of serotonin from central axons, and some are serotonin receptor agonists [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychotic symptoms in overdose occur from excess dopamine and serotonin. Ring substitutions and other "designer" modifications have produced various psychoactive properties. Hallucinogenic properties appear to be enhanced by greater 5HT-2a receptor agonism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our understanding of the mechanism of action for many of the synthetic cathinones is limited but specific actions are known for a few: methylone and pyrovalerone inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine with few serotonin effects; mephedrone favors dopamine reuptake inhibition [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Cytotoxicity of hepatocytes has been reported with some of these compounds.
        </p>
        <p>
         The synthetic cathinones are analogs of a naturally occurring substance found in the leaves of
         <em>
          Catha edulis
         </em>
         (Khat). Another synthetic cathinone, methcathinone, was widely abused in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the United States in the 1990s, and was banned worldwide [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The most common cathinones identified in outbreaks of abuse include eutylone [1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-(ethylamino)butan-1-one], mephedrone (4-methylenemethcathinone), MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone), methedrone (4-methoxymthcathinone), methylone (3,4-methelenedioxy-n-methcathinone) and flephedrone (4-fluoromethcathinone) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,5
         </a>
         ]. In the United Kingdom, analysis of 24 "legal high" products found 4-fluoromethcathinone, 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), and 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)pentan-1-one (pentylone,2), 3,4-methylenedioxy-alpha-pyrrolidinobutyrophenone (MDPBP).

         Our understanding of many of the synthetic cathinones is limited, but characteristics similar to other amphetamines would be expected based upon their structural similarities [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Amphetamines are lipophilic compounds that readily cross the blood-brain barrier [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This property results in rapid onset of effects when injected, inhaled, or insufflated. Oral ingestion yields peak concentrations in about two hours. Cathinone peaks after oral ingestion in about one hour. Amphetamines have large volumes of distribution (approximately 3 to 6 L/kg). Half-lives vary widely by drug, ranging from 3 to 24 hours, but may extend beyond 30 hours, as urinary elimination is extremely pH dependent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The metabolism of amphetamines occurs by several hepatic pathways and elimination is primarily renal [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Metabolism of cathinones generally occurs by demethylation followed by glucuronidation and sulfation, with metabolites eliminated primarily in the urine and bile [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The relatively alkaline nature of amphetamines favors excretion in an acidic urine medium, but artificial measures to further acidify the urine entail unacceptable risks and are not recommended.

         Although a history may be difficult to obtain or unreliable in the setting of acute intoxication, it is important to try to determine what drugs were taken and how much. History in the setting of drug poisoning is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See

        <p>
         Patients suspected of amphetamine use may be poisoned with other substances as well. As an example, the results of a survey of 947 reported mephedrone users suggests that over 80 percent abuse other substances, including alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy (MDMA), and cocaine, both simultaneously and on separate occasions [

         Signs of sympathetic excess or agitated delirium are the clinical features most closely associated with amphetamine and synthetic cathinone intoxication [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,7,9,10
         </a>
         ]. These signs include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, and mydriasis. Alterations in mental status can include anxiety, agitation, violent behavior, and seizures. Secondary complications can involve the kidneys, skeletal muscles, and gastrointestinal system. The most common causes of death related to amphetamine toxicity are arrhythmia, hyperthermia, and intracerebral hemorrhage [
         <a href="#rid7">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Inexperienced users of amphetamine may develop toxicity at a dose of 1 mg/kg, but chronic abusers may tolerate much higher doses. A methamphetamine dose of 1.3 mg/kg has been fatal [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         Amphetamine and synthetic cathinone intoxication can cause chest pain and palpitations, in addition to tachycardia and hypertension. A retrospective case series of 236 patients with exposure to cathinones reported tachycardia in 56 percent of patients (n = 132), hypertension in 17 percent (n = 41), and chest pain in 17 percent (n = 40) [

         Intoxication with synthetic cathinones produces a prominent neuropsychiatric syndrome whose symptoms and signs can include agitation (approximately 82 percent according to observational data), combativeness (approximately 57 percent), hallucinations (approximately 40 percent), paranoia (approximately 36 percent), confusion (approximately 34 percent), myoclonus (approximately 19 percent), and in rare cases seizures [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,9,15-17

         ]. Self-inflicted injuries (including violent suicide) and violence against others may occur while patients are delusional. Neuropsychiatric findings may be prolonged; intoxication with MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone) causes central nervous system (CNS) stimulation for approximately 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intoxication with typical amphetamines may produce similar effects on the CNS, but extreme neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs, which can occur following a single dosing of a synthetic cathinone, generally occur only following binge use of typical amphetamines.

         Most of the newer synthetic cathinone and similar "legal high" compounds (eg, synthetic cannabinoids K2 and Spice) are not detected by routine urine drug testing. Selected laboratories have successfully identified the synthetic cathinone compounds using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, but such testing is not routinely available, and is generally of no help with the acute management of intoxicated patients. Thus, such testing is usually not obtained unless needed for medico-legal reasons. (See

         Amphetamine and synthetic cathinone toxicity is a clinical diagnosis. Serum drug concentrations are rarely available in a timely manner and therefore of limited clinical usefulness. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a history of abuse and clinical features consistent with an overdose of these substances, primarily symptoms and signs of a sympathomimetic syndrome  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268" href="/z/d/graphic/71268.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Intoxication with amphetamines or a synthetic cathinone should be considered in any case of agitated delirium of unclear etiology.
        </p>
        <p>
         The newer synthetic cathinones differ from traditional amphetamines in that symptoms and signs often persist for many hours to several days in some cases. In severe cases, psychiatric findings and movement disorders have persisted for days to weeks [

         Amphetamines and the newer synthetic cathinones cause a sympathomimetic syndrome with features that range from pure adrenergic stimulation to a mixed picture of stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. Tables summarizing the major toxicologic syndromes of an acute hyperadrenergic state are provided  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268" href="/z/d/graphic/71268.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The most distinguishing feature of overdose with a synthetic cathinone is the prolonged duration of effect [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Many reports of "bath salt" cases describe agitated delirium and psychotic features lasting for days to even weeks. These compounds should be considered a possible cause in any case with such prolonged symptoms. While psychosis is a common finding in amphetamine abuse, seizures and chest pain are more commonly seen with pure stimulants, such as cocaine [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pure hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or psilocybin, generally do not cause adrenergic stimulation, and thus signs such as tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and diaphoresis are not prominent findings. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/313.html" rel="external">
          "Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in adults"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Anticholinergic poisoning has some features that are similar to amphetamine intoxication (eg, hyperthermia, tachycardia, agitation), but the absence of diaphoresis, dilated pupils, and flushed skin helps to distinguish this syndrome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/305.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Withdrawal, particularly from sedative hypnotics, ethanol, and benzodiazepines, can mimic amphetamine and synthetic cathinone toxicity. Withdrawal is a difficult diagnosis that requires obtaining a history of prolonged abuse followed by cessation. Giving appropriate treatment (such as a benzodiazepine) generally causes withdrawal symptoms to improve or resolve. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, heat stroke, and paranoid schizophrenia are nontoxicologic conditions that can mimic aspects of acute amphetamine and synthetic cathinone intoxication (eg, hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis, agitation), but each manifests findings that may help to distinguish them. Patients with thyrotoxicosis often demonstrate eyelid retraction and lag, proximal muscle weakness, and a palpable goiter. Pheochromocytoma often causes intermittent hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis. Heat stroke normally develops in a hot, humid environment, either following exertion or in patients with compromised thermoregulation due to disability, old age, or medication (eg, diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics). Patients with paranoid schizophrenia often have a history of prior psychosis and response to treatment. (See

         Control of agitation and other signs of sympathetic excess are the major problems confronting clinicians who manage patients with amphetamine or synthetic cathinone intoxication. Clinicians should also assess the hydration and nutritional status of patients presenting with acute intoxication from these agents. Many patients will have a long history of abuse and are at risk for acute decompensation if not given adequate hydration and proper nutritional support early in their course.

         Patients with agitated delirium from amphetamine or synthetic cathinone intoxication require aggressive management, which may entail protecting the patient's airway. This need may arise in patients with refractory agitation or loss of protective airway reflexes. Airway management in adults is reviewed separately. (See

         The effectiveness of gastrointestinal decontamination is related to the timing and route of administration. Activated charcoal (AC) and gastric lavage are generally of little value unless large doses of amphetamines have been ingested orally and the patient presents for medical care within one hour of the ingestion.
        </p>
        <p>
         From a practical standpoint, we reserve GI decontamination with AC or lavage for the rare instance of a massive ingestion, such as might occur with a body-stuffer or body-packer who arrives before significant absorption has occurred. In such cases, the potential benefits of decontamination outweigh the risks. (See

         Patients who are agitated or violent due to amphetamine intoxication pose a risk to themselves and healthcare personnel. Acute decompensation can occur if immediate measures are not taken to control the patient. Efforts to control agitated behavior should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory or other confirmation of drug exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         First line therapy for treating psychomotor agitation consists of IV benzodiazepines.

          diazepam
         </a>
         10 mg IV are reasonable starting doses for patients with significant agitation. The same or half the initial dose may be repeated every three to five minutes until agitation is controlled. Large cumulative doses of benzodiazepines (hundreds of milligrams) may be required and should be administered before abandoning this therapy. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and hypotension. Intramuscular lorazepam can be used if IV access is unavailable, but its peak effect is typically delayed (10 to 20 minutes). This approach is similar to that used to manage a pure stimulant overdose, such as cocaine or methamphetamine.
        </p>
        <p>
         The response to the agitated patient should reflect the severity of the presentation, but a combination of physical control and chemical sedation are often necessary initially to manage severely agitated patients. To avoid complications from hyperthermia and overexertion, physical restraints should be removed as soon as chemical sedation is achieved. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/291.html" rel="external">

         Hypovolemia is frequently associated with agitated delirium so fluid resuscitation with boluses of IV isotonic crystalloid should be given to patients with signs of volume depletion.

         Although butyrophenones (eg,

         ) have been suggested for use in sympathomimetic ingestions, there are no controlled studies evaluating their safety and efficacy in synthetic cathinone intoxications. Since these agents interfere with heat dissipation, lower the seizure threshold, and may prolong the QTc interval, we suggest they not be used as first-line therapy for psychomotor agitation in the setting of amphetamine or synthetic cathinone intoxication. These medications may have a role in the unusual circumstance of a patient with severe, acute intoxication whose psychomotor agitation fails to improve with large cumulative doses of benzodiazepines [

         Uncontrolled agitation and excessive muscle activity generate heat and cause hyperthermia (temperature ≥41.1°C).

The approach used is identical to that used for patients with hyperthermia following methamphetamine intoxication and is described separately (see

         Hypertension from amphetamine intoxication is generally well controlled with the benzodiazepines used to manage psychomotor agitation. We believe that optimal therapy for patients experiencing cardiovascular complications from acute sympathomimetic poisoning begins with reduction in central nervous system catecholamine release rather than peripheral antagonism of released catecholamines, and that benzodiazepines have a proven role in this regard.

         Poisoning with sympathomimetic agents, such as amphetamines or methamphetamine, can produce a hyperadrenergic state associated with an increase in both alpha- and beta-adrenergic tone. Administration of beta blockers to patients with sympathomimetic drug toxicity raises the concern of exacerbating hypertension due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. Should beta blockade be performed in this setting, it should be reserved for patients with persistent hypertension despite appropriate treatment with benzodiazepines and done cautiously, ideally in combination with an alpha antagonist or some other vasodilator without beta blocking effects (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of children with amphetamine intoxication is similar to that of adults, but special consideration should be directed toward aggressive cooling measures and close monitoring of vital signs and urine output. Hydration should be sufficient to maintain urine output at 2 mL/minute to prevent renal injury from myoglobin deposition. Appropriate social and child protective services should be enlisted in all cases prior to releasing the child from the hospital.

         Valvular heart disease is a common complication of amphetamine abuse. Valvular dysfunction may be related to the direct serotonergic effects of these drugs, as was postulated in cases related to appetite-suppressants during the late 1990s. Valvular dysfunction from aortic rupture or dissection is likely due to vasospastic and hypertensive effects. The possibility of endocarditis is always a concern with injection drug use. (See

          Clinical features of intoxication
         </strong>
         – Signs of sympathetic excess and agitated delirium are the clinical features most closely associated with traditional amphetamine and synthetic cathinone intoxication. These signs include tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, and mydriasis. Alterations in mental status can include anxiety, agitation, violent behavior, and seizures. Traditional amphetamines include

         The most distinguishing feature of overdose with a synthetic cathinone is the prolonged duration of effect. Intoxication produces a prominent neuropsychiatric syndrome whose symptoms and signs can include agitation, combativeness, hallucinations, paranoia, confusion, myoclonus, and in rare cases seizures. A similar syndrome can develop in patients who binge on traditional amphetamines.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Amphetamine and synthetic cathinone toxicity is a clinical diagnosis. Serum drug concentrations are of limited clinical usefulness. Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a history of abuse and clinical features consistent with an overdose, primarily symptoms and signs of a sympathomimetic syndrome  (

         10 mg IV are reasonable starting doses for patients with significant agitation. The same or half the initial dose may be repeated every three to five minutes until agitation is controlled. Large cumulative doses of benzodiazepines (hundreds of milligrams) may be required. It is important to address possible hydration and nutritional needs of patients presenting with acute psychomotor agitation. (See
