         Management of the thalassemia syndromes can be challenging due to the numerous potential disease complications and the lack of available therapies other than transfusion and hematopoietic cell transplantation, both of which have associated morbidities and costs. This topic review discusses the approach to managing alpha and beta thalassemias, including transfusion-dependent and transfusion-independent (mild or intermediate severity) disease.

         Thalassemia refers to a group of inherited hemoglobinopathies where there is a quantitative defect in the production of alpha globin or beta globin chains. The resulting imbalance in the ratio of alpha to beta globin chains leads to precipitation of the unpaired chains, which in turn causes destruction of developing red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow that can lead to ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, and iron overload.

         Major issues in the management of thalassemia involve treatment of anemia (if severe enough to cause symptoms); reduction of ineffective erythropoiesis, which can lead to various morbidities such as impaired growth and development, bone expansion, hypersplenism, or cosmetic concerns; prevention of excess iron stores; and treatment of the complications of iron overload if they occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         In children with clinically significant disease, the chronic anemia and/or iron overload can lead to comorbidities such as delayed puberty, other endocrine dysfunction, abnormal bone metabolism, and/or delayed growth. These findings can occur even with the best feasible transfusion support, although they can often be mitigated with therapy, usually requiring subspecialty consultation.

          Transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia
         </strong>
         – Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) encompasses the previously used designations of beta thalassemia major and some beta thalassemia intermedia phenotypes. These individuals generally require chronic transfusions and are managed with a prespecified pretransfusion hemoglobin level. This helps to treat and prevent severe, symptomatic anemia and suppresses extramedullary hematopoiesis and its complications.

         Iron overload is inevitable; monitoring iron stores and use of iron chelation are integral components of therapy (see

          Non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia

         – Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia phenotypes encompass the designations of beta thalassemia minor, thalassemia trait, or thalassemia minima. These individuals typically do not require any interventions for anemia or other deviations from routine medical care. However, it is important for them to be aware of their diagnosis so that they do not undergo unnecessary testing or empiric treatment with iron for an incorrect diagnosis of iron deficiency, as well as for prenatal planning for potential pregnancies.

          Severe forms of alpha thalassemia

         The goals of treating anemia in individuals with thalassemia include reducing symptoms and morbidities associated with anemia (such as impaired growth and development in childhood); reducing or preventing extramedullary hematopoiesis, which can lead to a number of morbidities associated with impaired growth and development, bone expansion, and hypersplenism; and reducing excess iron stores associated with increased intestinal iron absorption and/or transfusion [
         <a href="#rid4">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In thalassemia, chronic transfusions are used to maintain the hemoglobin at a level that both reduces symptoms of anemia and at least somewhat suppresses extramedullary hematopoiesis. Thus, higher pretransfusion hemoglobin values are sought (typical range, 9 to 10 or 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. This approach is referred to by different names ("hypertransfusion" in the United States; "moderate transfusion" in Europe). These thresholds differ from those used in other anemias, where the goal is only to raise the hemoglobin level above a certain threshold, typically with the smallest number of transfusions as possible. (See

         For cases of alpha thalassemia major with severe fetal anemia, intrauterine transfusion may be possible, followed by chronic transfusions after birth. (See

         For children with beta thalassemia major, we recommend chronic transfusion, initiated in early childhood as soon as the disease manifestations (eg, severe anemia) become present. (See

         For individuals with thalassemia intermedia who have anemia that is severe enough to require transfusion, decisions must be made regarding whether to initiate a chronic transfusion regimen to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis or to provide periodic transfusions for symptomatic relief and/or during periods of increased stress. (See

         For individuals with thalassemia minor, transfusions are not required; anemia is very mild or absent. Development of anemia should prompt evaluation for a cause other than thalassemia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5927.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals with thalassemia can develop anemia due to other causes that should be addressed and treated to reduce the transfusional iron burden. Examples include hemolysis related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which has a similar geographic distribution as thalassemia; folate deficiency due to increased requirement caused by chronic hemolysis; aplastic crisis due to parvovirus B19 infection; hemolytic crisis; or hypersplenism due to extramedullary hematopoiesis. Evaluation for these other causes of anemia depends on the patient history and presenting findings, as discussed below and in separate topic reviews. (See

         In some cases of severe disease, it may be appropriate to pursue other interventions for anemia such as splenectomy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or other therapies discussed below. (See

The purpose is to compensate for increased folate requirements associated with increased red blood cell (RBC) turnover. It may be reasonable to omit folic acid supplements if this is especially burdensome to the patient or family and/or if there is no clinical evidence of folate deficiency.

         It is prudent for individuals with thalassemia to avoid taking iron-containing supplements (eg, vitamins plus iron) unless they have documented iron deficiency given that thalassemia can be associated with increased iron absorption [

          14
         </a>
         ]. Despite the general recommendations to avoid excess iron, iron replacement therapy should not be withheld from those with true iron deficiency anemia. (See

          Thalassemia major
         </strong>
         – Individuals with thalassemia major are transfusion-dependent. For these individuals, we suggest chronic transfusions administered on a regular basis to prevent the hemoglobin from dropping below a prespecified level, rather than a more restrictive strategy. In the context of thalassemia, chronic transfusion may be referred to as "hypertransfusion" (in the United States) or "moderate transfusion" (in Europe). For most of these individuals, we suggest a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of approximately 9.5 to 10 g/dL. The number of units transfused depends on the individual's body size and baseline hemoglobin level. In adults, it is usually not practical to give more than two units of packed RBCs at a time, so the interval between transfusions is adjusted to maintain the hemoglobin level in the appropriate range. The timing of initiation is typically when the individual becomes symptomatic transfusion-dependent in early infancy; the indication to initiate therapy in these children is invariably straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most individuals with alpha thalassemia major have hydrops fetalis and do not survive in utero, although cases have been described in which exchange transfusion or hematopoietic cell transplantation was performed in utero and followed, after birth, by hematopoietic cell transplantation [

          Thalassemia intermedia
         </strong>
         – Thalassemia intermedia phenotypes encompass a range of clinical phenotypes. Transfusions are given as needed; often, this is during periods of erythropoietic stress such as acute infectious illnesses, periods of rapid growth, surgery, or pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Many individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia will eventually become transfusion-dependent and require chronic transfusion therapy, but this may not be needed until adulthood (eg, third to fourth decade of life) and does not always occur [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Deciding to initiate regular transfusions in such cases is significantly more challenging, and we individualize this decision based on the patient's age and specific disease complications, balanced with the burdens of a regular transfusion program including increased iron stores. The decision takes into account the patient's activity limitations, growth, development, and the early appearance of skeletal changes or other disease-related complications [

         Symptoms usually develop when the hemoglobin level falls below 7 g/dL, although there is no specific hemoglobin level that can be used to guide the decision. Assessment by a clinician with expertise in treating hemoglobinopathies is prudent. Once the decision to initiate regular transfusions is made, the patient is treated similar to those with beta thalassemia major. However, indefinite transfusions may not be necessary for individuals with thalassemia intermedia, and transfusion indications should be reassessed periodically.

         Many individuals with alpha thalassemia intermedia phenotypes who have hemoglobin levels above 8 to 9 g/dL will be able to avoid chronic transfusions, and these individuals may do well with only intermittent transfusions when needed, such as in the setting of infection or pregnancy. Individuals with hemoglobin H disease are at increased risk of oxidative stress to RBCs and may require closer monitoring and possibly transfusion during infections or upon exposure to oxidant drugs.

         </span>
         The typical chronic transfusion regimen (referred to as hypertransfusion in the United States or moderate transfusion in Europe) is designed to maintain a relatively stable hemoglobin level that is adequate to maintain good cardiovascular status and exercise tolerance and to at least partially suppress ineffective erythropoiesis, thus limiting increased gastrointestinal iron absorption.
        </p>
        <p>
         For most individuals treated with chronic transfusion to reduce complications of ineffective or extramedullary hematopoiesis, we suggest using a regimen that results in a pretransfusion hemoglobin level in the range of 9 to 10 or 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL rather than higher or lower levels [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. This approach is directed at achieving the optimal balance between suppressing hematopoiesis and minimizing iron overload. A higher level may be used for individuals with heart disease, clinically significant extramedullary hematopoiesis, inadequately suppressed bone marrow, or back pain prior to transfusion [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. A lower level (such as 8.5 g/dL) may be used if the primary goal of transfusion is to treat anemia rather than to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally avoid giving more than 10 mL per kg of packed RBCs in a single day; this is a dose that should yield a post-transfusion hemoglobin increase of approximately 3 to 3.5 g/dL. If there is uncertainty about the appropriate number of units to give, administration of the equivalent of two units of packed RBCs every two to four weeks or one to three units of packed RBCs every three to five weeks is a good starting point. Occasional reports of bizarre reactions occurring within the first 24 to 48 hours after transfusion have led to the recommendation that no more than 10 to 15 mL of RBCs per kg of body weight be administered during any 24-hour period, and we tend to favor the more conservative end of this range (ie, no more than 10 mL of RBCs per kg) except in cases of profound emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
         Transfusions can be repeated daily or every two to three days until the pretransfusion hemoglobin is in the range of 9.5 to 10.5 g/dL. The post-transfusion hemoglobin should be approximately 12 to 13 and no higher than 15 g/dL. The timing and dose of RBC transfusions can then be titrated for the individual patient. Typically, a dose of 8 to 10 mL of RBCs per kg every two to three weeks will maintain the desired hemoglobin levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         For children undergoing chronic transfusions, we try to avoid central venous catheter placement; however, an evaluation of the need for a central venous access catheter may be appropriate, especially if lifelong transfusional support is anticipated. Ideally, we try to defer this until after the rapid growth of infancy and toddlerhood has occurred to avoid the need for frequent revision of intravenous access devices.
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted below, extended crossmatching to prevent alloimmunization, leukocyte depletion to reduce febrile nonhemolytic reactions, and other measures to reduce transfusion reactions are used. (See

         A 1964 cross-sectional survey compared outcomes in 35 children under 12 years of age with beta thalassemia who were chronically transfused to low, intermediate, or high hemoglobin levels (pretransfusion hemoglobin levels of 4 to 5.9, 6 to 7.9, or 8 to 9.9 g/dL, respectively) [

          21

Despite having relatively similar baseline ages and hematologic characteristics, these children demonstrated strong correlations between higher hemoglobin levels and improved clinical outcomes, including greater height, smaller liver and spleen size (for those who had not undergone splenectomy), less frontal skull thickening and maxillary overgrowth, less periodontal and dental disease, and fewer bone fractures, all potential indicators of reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis.

As an example, a retrospective review evaluated 32 children with beta thalassemia who were transfused to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 10 to 12 g/dL (mean, 11.3 g/dL) and then were subsequently switched to a lower pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 9 to 10 g/dL (mean, 9.4 g/dL) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. The switch correlated with a decreased number of transfusions (from approximately 137 to 104 mL/kg/year) and a decreased ferritin level (from 2280 to 1004 mcg/L); the lower threshold did not appear to be associated with laboratory changes of increased erythroid activity or adverse effects on growth or endocrine function.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial number of units (or volume of blood) to transfuse depends on the starting hemoglobin level, the desired increase, the hematocrit of the packed RBCs, and the size of the patient  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ). Adjustments require some empirical dose-finding for each individual. Regardless of the dose and schedule, the post-transfusion hemoglobin level should not exceed 14 to 15 g/dL due to risks of hyperviscosity [

         Individuals with thalassemia major, as well as a subset of those with thalassemia intermedia phenotypes, will eventually develop iron overload, which in turn can cause organ toxicity and even death [
         <a href="#rid25">

         ]. Iron stores are monitored on a regular basis in these individuals  (

          table 3

         ). We typically use the serum ferritin level for serial testing. We obtain baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and use MRI-based estimates of liver or cardiac iron concentration for individuals with signs of organ injury if there is a significant increase in serum ferritin or if ferritin values are discordant with clinical expectations. Liver biopsy may be used, but this is less common with the availability of MRI. There are no reliable criteria for pancreatic iron overload; liver iron overload is used as a surrogate.

         For most children with beta thalassemia major, iron chelation is instituted before six years of age (often as early as two to four years). For those with alpha or beta thalassemia intermedia, the need for chelation depends on whether (or when) chronic transfusion is used and the parameters listed above; often, this is in the second or third decade of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         MRI appears to be superior to measurement of serum ferritin for estimating total body iron burden in these patients, especially in individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia. In beta thalassemia intermedia, serum ferritin may underestimate the total body iron. This was illustrated in a 2008 study in which 74 individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia had both serum ferritin testing and liver MRI [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Serum iron levels increased with age according to both modalities. However, serum ferritin correlated with liver iron only in those with thalassemia major and not in those with thalassemia intermedia. A proposed hypothesis for this difference was that individuals with thalassemia major were receiving more transfusions, leading to increased distribution to the reticuloendothelial system and increased ferritin, whereas for those with thalassemia intermedia, the main source of iron overload was increased intestinal absorption with deposition in the liver and less of an increase in serum ferritin. Smaller studies of individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia have appeared to corroborate this finding [

         Individuals receiving regular transfusions are at increased risk for alloimmunization, in which exposure to foreign antigens on donor RBCs leads to formation of alloantibodies that react with donor RBCs and typically cause delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7932.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The prevalence of alloimmunization in thalassemia has been estimated to be in the range of 10 to 50 percent. Lower rates in some populations may reflect a more homogenous genetic background (eg, 8 percent in Egypt, 6 percent in Eastern India) or the use of more extensive crossmatching protocols [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When blood is requested, the blood bank or transfusion medicine service should be made aware that the patient has thalassemia so that extra care can be taken to avoid possible alloimmunization. This may include matching for Rh antigens other than RhD, such as C and E, and Kell [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32-35
         </a>
         ]. Some reports have suggested that starting the transfusion program at a younger age may be associated with a lower rate of alloimmunization [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,36,37
         </a>
         ]. Other strategies to reduce the risk of alloimmunization such as extended antigen matching or molecular matching are similar to those used in patients with sickle cell disease. (See

         Splenectomy may improve anemia and reduce transfusion requirements in some individuals, which in turn may reduce excess iron accumulation, although the benefit of splenectomy in reducing iron accumulation is becoming less relevant with the institution of regular iron chelation therapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,50,51
         </a>
         ]. Splenectomy may also improve cytopenias due to hypersplenism or symptoms related to splenomegaly, although these findings are also becoming less common in the setting of regular transfusions and chelation therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117640.html" rel="external">
          "Elective (diagnostic or therapeutic) splenectomy", section on 'Indications'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         These potential benefits must be balanced with the risks of surgery, the possibility that a benefit may be transient, and the potential for postsplenectomy complications including increased risks of thromboembolism, life-threatening infection, and pulmonary hypertension. The risk of thromboembolic disease appears to be higher in individuals with thalassemia (especially beta thalassemia intermedia) following splenectomy (over an increased baseline risk due to thalassemia). In a retrospective cohort of 83 individuals with beta thalassemia intermedia followed for a decade, 24 (29 percent) had an episode of venous thromboembolism; all except one had undergone splenectomy for their disease [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Case reports have described portal vein thrombosis after laparoscopic splenectomy in thalassemia [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53,54
         </a>
         ]. The relative contributions of splenectomy and thalassemia to these complications is hard to disentangle. The underlying hypercoagulable state in thalassemia and differences between different thalassemia phenotypes are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Venous thromboembolism'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to pursue splenectomy is therefore a difficult one and should be made on a case-by-case basis that balances risks and benefits for the individual patient. When pursued, splenectomy is generally deferred until at least the age of four years, often much later [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Appropriate use of pre-splenectomy vaccines and prophylactic antibiotics is important for reducing the risk of sepsis. Additional considerations related to splenectomy such as the choice of surgical approach, pre-splenectomy vaccinations, prophylactic antibiotics, and other potential short- and long-term complications are discussed separately.

          Decision to pursue allogeneic HSCT

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for thalassemia that may be appropriate for those with severe disease (eg, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia). However, transplant toxicities and transplant-related mortality are serious concerns, even for the best candidates (ie, young children with no comorbidities and a human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-identical sibling donor). Lack of a suitable donor or the lack of available resources to perform HSCT are both major barriers that eliminate the HSCT option for many individuals. A role for HSCT in alpha thalassemia (eg, hemoglobin H disease) has not been established but may be pursued for severe disease (hemoglobin Barts). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131582.html" rel="external">
          "Alpha thalassemia major: Prenatal and postnatal management", section on 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplant'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite these barriers, HSCT may be appropriate for some individuals, such as children with beta thalassemia major who have been treated with chronic transfusion and chelation and have a suitable donor  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127604" href="/z/d/graphic/127604.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The decision whether, and when, to pursue HSCT for a patient with thalassemia is highly complex and should be made only in consultation with a thalassemia specialist in conjunction with an experienced high-volume transplant center. The challenge is that the mortality and significant morbidities associated with HSCT are lowest if the HSCT is administered during the mid-first decade of life, prior to the development of significant iron overload and/or other comorbidities such as liver fibrosis or hypersplenism; however, this is also the time when the long-term clinical prognosis with conventional therapy is often not yet clear. Individuals with hypersplenism usually undergo splenectomy before HSCT. The decision will also be influenced by the availability of a well-matched donor. As a general guide, a child who is transfusion-dependent, requires iron chelation, and has a matched donor should be evaluated with an initial consultation for HSCT.
        </p>
        <p>
         As investigational methods for performing HSCT such as the use of partially matched donors and reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens evolve, the indications may broaden, especially for adolescents and young adults [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Thus, any transfusion-dependent individual or individual with significant comorbidities such as growth retardation or bony deformities may be referred for a transplant evaluation.

          59

         ]. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) paused a clinical study of a different but related lentiviral vector gene therapy program in sickle cell disease "out of an abundance of caution" [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60

Longer follow-up to monitor the durability of transfected gene activity will be extremely important. Safety concerns related to this and other gene therapy approaches are paramount.

         Many of the complications of thalassemia are caused by iron overload. This occurs because ineffective erythropoiesis promotes excessive iron absorption, which can be further exacerbated by chronic transfusions. Thus, assessment of iron stores and reduction of excess iron stores is an integral component of prevention and therapy for these complications. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment of iron stores and initiation of chelation therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The pace of developing complications related to iron overload depends on the severity of thalassemia and the frequency of transfusions. As an example, an individual with beta thalassemia major who receives chronic transfusions without chelation therapy may develop severe iron overload in childhood, whereas one with beta thalassemia intermedia who receives intermittent transfusions may not develop severe iron overload in childhood. Even though patients with the thalassemia intermedia phenotype can live with only occasional or even no transfusions, some patients eventually develop iron overload because their anemia and brisk ineffective erythropoiesis drive excessive enteric iron uptake. The severity of anemia, frequency of transfusions, and especially the intensity of ineffective erythropoiesis all modulate the onset and severity of iron overload. These patients also require monitoring of iron burden.

         Individuals with thalassemia major are typically cared for by a specialist and are seen at least two to four times a year to monitor progression of any of the major morbidities. Once the pace of any complication is established to be stable, follow-up for general care and monitoring can be done by either a specialist or the patient's primary clinician. Frequent contact with the patient is feasible because of the regular transfusion schedule. Patients can be evaluated when onsite for transfusion.

         At follow-up visits for transfusion-dependent thalassemia, once the transfusion schedule is established, and for thalassemia intermedia, we monitor a number of organ systems as well as overall health. The use of a checklist can ensure that evaluations have been performed at appropriate intervals [

It is important to educate these patients about the tendency of providers to confuse thalassemia trait with iron deficiency and prescribe iron supplements, while at the same time noting that they are susceptible to all of the usual causes of iron deficiency. Any change in their blood counts or recommendation for iron therapy should prompt a visit to a hematologist for counseling.

         Acute decompensated heart failure in thalassemia is a medical emergency that requires close electrocardiographic and hemodynamic monitoring; correction of electrolyte abnormalities, maintenance of meticulous glucose control, and optimization of kidney, liver, and thyroid function; searching for other precipitating factors such as infection; and initiation of chelation therapy (if indicated) [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91

         ]. Early involvement of specialist consultants is advised. (See

         There is no consensus on the best approach to cardiac monitoring, and data are limited. As noted above, we perform a baseline cardiac MRI that is repeated if there are significant changes in ferritin (see
         <a class="local">
          'Routine evaluations and monitoring'
         </a>
         above). Other evaluations are individualized according to the individual's symptoms, findings on physical examination, and availability of resources such as MRI.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac MRI is considered the gold standard for measurement of all left and right ventricular indices, while myocardial iron deposition can be quantified reproducibly with myocardial T2*, a relaxation parameter that is increased with iron deposition [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. Low T2* (eg, below 10 ms) indicates iron deposition. The importance of using T2* MRI was illustrated in an international survey involving 3095 patients with beta thalassemia major [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92
         </a>
         ]. Of these, approximately one-half had evidence of cardiac iron deposition on first MRI, and future development of heart failure correlated strongly with reduced T2* on MRI. (See

         The principal interventions for cardiac disease are transfusions for severe, symptomatic anemia (see
         <a class="local">
          'Management of anemia'
         </a>
         above) and iron chelation to prevent or treat cardiac iron overload. We routinely start chelation in all individuals treated with a chronic transfusion program and/or any of the parameters of excess iron stores listed above. (See

         The risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may be increased in individuals with thalassemia due to chronic hemolysis, iron overload, and other manifestations. (See

        <p>
         A 2022 study evaluated long-term outcomes in 24 patients with beta thalassemia who had documented PAH by right heart catheterization in the absence of chronic cardiopulmonary disease [
         <a href="#rid94">
          94
         </a>
         ]. At a median age of 46.5 years and a median follow-up of four years, 13 of the patients had died (all-cause mortality rate 54 percent, 95% CI 33-75 percent). Ten of the deaths were attributed to PAH (nine right-sided heart failure, one pulmonary embolism; PAH-related mortality rate 42 percent, 95% CI 22-63 percent). Cumulative PAH-related mortality-free survival estimates at one, two, and five years were 78, 65, and 60 percent. Survival strongly correlated with PAH therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         An editorialist noted that many patients with thalassemia and PAH are undertreated and emphasized the need for routine monitoring and multidisciplinary treatment, including risk factor modification (treatment of iron overload, hypercoagulability, sleep apnea, and lung disease) and interventions for those with tricuspid jet velocity ≥3 m/sec [

         We typically perform a baseline ultrasound at the time of diagnosis and repeat testing at least twice a year in individuals with thalassemia who are regularly transfused and/or have evidence of iron overload, severe liver disease, or cirrhosis.

         The major bone complications of thalassemia intermedia and thalassemia major are related to extramedullary hematopoiesis and expansion of the erythroid bone marrow. This can lead to osteopenia/osteoporosis, premature limb shortening, delayed skeletal maturation, and changes in the structure of facial and other bones, leading to cosmetic and dental abnormalities and pathologic fractures. The severity of these complications tends to correlate with overall disease severity; it has been suggested that individuals with thalassemia major have a much higher rate of bone turnover than those with thalassemia intermedia [

Therapy was well tolerated, but there was no control arm, and follow-up was short (one to two years in most studies). A 2016 Cochrane review addressing the role of hydroxyurea in thalassemia identified one randomized trial comparing two doses of hydroxyurea (10 versus 20 mg/kg daily), which found higher hemoglobin levels with the
         <strong>
          lower
         </strong>
         dose of hydroxyurea (mean difference, 2.4 mg/dL; 95% CI 2.0-2.8); the trial did not report the effects on transfusion requirements, and the authors of the systematic review concluded that high-quality data were lacking to show any benefit of hydroxyurea in these individuals [

         The explanation for the reduced efficacy in thalassemia compared with sickle cell disease may be related to the differences in erythropoietic activity between the two disorders. Sickling and hemolysis occur predominantly in the peripheral circulation, where decreases in oxygen tension lead to hemoglobin polymerization. By contrast, thalassemias are characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, with failure of normal red blood cell (RBC) maturation and premature death of RBC precursors. This process is also called intramedullary hemolysis to distinguish it from hemolysis within the peripheral circulation.

          Hydroxyurea
         </a>
         appears to improve production of Hb F-containing RBCs but does not ameliorate intramedullary hemolysis and apoptosis. In addition, hydroxyurea is myelosuppressive, which may exacerbate the anemia in thalassemia to a greater degree than in sickle cell disease. It is also possible that the benefit of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease is more greatly mediated by effects on the vasculature and vaso-occlusion, possibly because of the lowered neutrophil counts (untreated individuals with sickle cell disease usually exhibit some level of neutrophilia), which are not major considerations in thalassemia. Hydroxyurea would not be expected to lead to improvements in alpha thalassemia because its major mechanism of action is increasing production of the beta-like gamma globin chains used to make Hb F.

Transfusion therapy reduces symptoms and morbidities associated with anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis; ineffective erythropoiesis can impair growth and development and cause skeletal abnormalities, splenomegaly, and iron overload. Luspatercept can reduce transfusion requirements in adults with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.

          Transfusion-dependent

         – For individuals with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT, previously called thalassemia major phenotype), we suggest chronic transfusion to reduce symptoms of anemia and suppress extramedullary hematopoiesis (

          Grade 2C
