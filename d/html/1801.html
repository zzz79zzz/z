It is characterized by hyperglycemia and variable degrees of insulin deficiency and resistance. Its prevalence rises markedly with increasing weight.</p><p>Management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus includes education, evaluation for microvascular and macrovascular complications, achievement of target glycemia, treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, and avoidance of drugs that can aggravate abnormalities of glucose or lipid metabolism. Weight reduction, diet, and oral medication are used initially to improve glycemic management. Over time, the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes will require additional therapy to maintain glycemic targets. The therapeutic options for such patients include adding a second or third oral agent or an injectable agent, such as a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or insulin, or switching to insulin.</p><p>The role of insulin in achieving optimal glycemic control in nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes will be reviewed here. Options for initial therapy, options for the management of persistent hyperglycemia, and other therapeutic issues in diabetes management, such as the frequency of monitoring and evaluation for microvascular and macrovascular complications, are discussed separately. Insulin treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is also reviewed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1779.html" rel="external">"Initial management of hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1790.html" rel="external">"Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1750.html" rel="external">"Overview of general medical care in nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4802.html" rel="external">"Pregestational (preexisting) diabetes mellitus: Antenatal glycemic control", section on 'Insulin pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6790.html" rel="external">"Gestational diabetes mellitus: Glucose management and maternal prognosis", section on 'Insulin'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys">●</span><span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120430">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120430" href="/pathway/120430?topicRef=1801&amp;source=see_link">Diabetes: Initial therapy for non-pregnant adults with type 2 DM</a>.)</span></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys">●</span><span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-129531">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-129531" href="/pathway/129531?topicRef=1801&amp;source=see_link">Diabetes: Medication selection for non-pregnant adults with type 2 DM and persistent hyperglycemia despite monotherapy</a>.)</span></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys">●</span><span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120323">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120323" href="/pathway/120323?topicRef=1801&amp;source=see_link">Diabetes: Initiation and titration of insulin therapy in non-pregnant adults with type 2 DM</a>.)</span></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H955358"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Insulin preparations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In type 2 diabetes, insulin is generally provided in three ways:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As a basal supplement with an intermediate-acting to long-acting preparation (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH], detemir, glargine, or the very long-acting degludec) to suppress hepatic glucose production and maintain glucose levels at target in the fasting state</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As a pre-meal (prandial) bolus dose of short-acting (regular) or rapid-acting (eg, lispro, aspart, glulisine) insulin to cover the extra requirements after food is absorbed</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As a premixed combination of intermediate-acting and short-acting or rapid-acting insulin</p><p></p><p>The approximate time of onset, half-life, effective peak, and duration of action of the most commonly used insulins are reviewed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130874" data-inline-graphics="130874" href="/z/d/graphic/130874.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and in more detail elsewhere. There is substantial intra-individual and inter-individual variability in onset and duration of insulin action related to the volume injected, the injection site, injection technique, and multiple other factors; therefore, insulin must be adjusted based on patient response. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1752.html" rel="external">"General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus", section on 'Insulin preparations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1823692803"><span class="h2">Physiologic insulin replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insulin is secreted in a pulsatile manner; pulses occur under basal (unstimulated) conditions and in response to meals [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Basal insulin secretion represents approximately 50 percent of 24-hour insulin production, with the remainder accounted for by prandial (mealtime) excursions.</p><p>The term "intensive insulin therapy" has been used to describe complex regimens that include basal insulin (given as one to two daily injections of intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin) and superimposed injections of short-acting or rapid-acting insulins three or more times daily before meals to limit postprandial glycemic excursions. While intensive regimens are the preferred regimen for patients with type 1 diabetes using multiple daily insulin injections (rather than an insulin pump), they may be used for patients with type 2 diabetes as well, especially for patients taking high doses of insulin and for those with insulin deficiency.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1648862339"><span class="h2">Disadvantages of insulin therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major drawbacks associated with insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes are weight gain and hypoglycemia, although data suggest that these are not common or severe with use of basal insulin alone [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Nonetheless, these adverse effects should be reviewed at every visit in those taking insulin, and the goal of weight loss or weight maintenance should be emphasized. Glycemic targets may need to be relaxed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and/or insulin-associated weight gain. (See <a class="local">'Troubleshooting'</a> below.)</p><p>The safety of human insulin versus insulin analogs, including concerns about diabetic complications and risk of cancer, is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1752.html" rel="external">"General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus", section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1919079"><span class="h2">Monitoring glycemia</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glycated hemoglobin (A1C)</strong> – A1C is the most widely used clinical test to monitor chronic glycemic management.

A reasonable goal of therapy for most patients might be an A1C value ≤7.0 percent (using an assay aligned to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT] in which the upper limit of normal is 6.0 percent) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/15628.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). The A1C goal should be set somewhat higher for older patients, patients with comorbidities, and those with a limited life expectancy.

In older patients, those with chronic kidney disease, or those with other risk factors for hypoglycemia, in whom the A1C goal is set higher, a higher fasting glucose target (eg, 90 or 100 to 150 mg/dL [5 to 8.3 mmol/L]) may be used.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3196022471"><span class="h2">Cardiovascular effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Compared with oral agents and independent of the level of glycemia achieved, insulin does not appear to prevent or increase major adverse cardiovascular events.

It is often simpler to counsel smaller lunches, and then add a single injection of prandial insulin before dinner, which, for many people, is the largest meal of the day. If lunch is the largest meal of the day, the reverse approach may be used (eg, cover lunch with prandial insulin, eat a smaller dinner).</p><p>For patients taking bedtime NPH or detemir who have pre-dinner hyperglycemia, adding another dose of NPH or detemir insulin at breakfast is an alternative, particularly if pre-lunch glucose is also elevated.

In the setting of multiple daily insulin injections, oral agents other than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9621" href="/z/d/drug information/9621.html" rel="external">metformin</a> are usually discontinued to reduce polypharmacy and cost.

The ability to inject rapid-acting insulins 10 to 15 minutes before meals (as opposed to the 30 to 45 minutes before the meal with regular [short-acting] insulin) is more convenient and may improve adherence. There is little glycemic advantage of rapid-acting compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> in type 2 diabetes [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials (involving 2751 patients with type 2 diabetes) that compared rapid-acting insulin analogs with regular insulin as pre-meal bolus doses, no significant differences were seen in serum A1C concentrations or the number of hypoglycemic episodes [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pre-meal insulin dosing</strong> – The optimal dose of pre-meal insulin depends upon many factors, including current and target blood glucose values, carbohydrate content of the meal, and activity. A typical starting dose is approximately 4 to 6 units or 10 percent of basal insulin dose  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73793" href="/z/d/graphic/73793.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The dose can be increased every three days until the postprandial blood glucose target is achieved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prandial insulin dose increases depend on how much prandial insulin the patient is using.

Many patients benefit from specific training in carbohydrate counting, which requires some arithmetical computations that some patients find difficult or burdensome. It is uncertain if there is a glycemic advantage to carbohydrate counting in patients with type 2 diabetes. As an example, in a 24-week, randomized trial in 277 adults with type 2 diabetes, there was no difference in A1C values when mealtime insulin adjustments were based upon a simple algorithm (according to previous weeks' blood glucose monitoring results) versus carbohydrate counting, using an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio for each meal [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Either method is acceptable, and patient preference can guide the choice of method for pre-meal dosing. A simplified adaptation in which patients take a slightly higher dose of prandial insulin for high carbohydrate meals may yield many of the benefits of carbohydrate counting without the complexity and is more straightforward for most patients with type 2 diabetes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1766.html" rel="external">"Nutritional considerations in type 2 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Carbohydrate consistency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For some patients, providing supplemental insulin in addition to prandial insulin is an option. In this framework, every prandial insulin dose can be considered to have two components: the part covering the meal (prandial) and the part correcting the hyperglycemia (supplemental insulin). For people with type 2 diabetes, 1 to 2 units for every 50 mg/dL above the target glucose may be added to the prandial insulin dose. Since the math can be confusing for many people, patients may be prescribed a "mealtime sliding scale" in which the recommended dose of insulin increases with the plasma glucose level. In this approach, the "mealtime sliding scale" includes the prandial and supplemental components. It is important to educate the patient that this combined scale could lead to insulin overdose if used for supplemental or correction insulin dosing when the patient is not eating. Patients should be counseled to reduce the insulin dose for exercise or for procedures that require limiting food intake. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1753.html" rel="external">"Perioperative management of blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Glucose management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Premixed insulin</strong> – Some insulins are commercially available in a premixed formulation. Most premixed (biphasic) preparations contain an intermediate-acting insulin and either a short-acting or a rapid-acting insulin. The major drawback of premixed insulin is limited flexibility in adjusting doses. However, premixed insulin is a reasonable option for patients with type 2 diabetes who are doing well on a stable, fixed ratio of short- and intermediate-acting insulin, or who are able to modify their diets to match the kinetics of premixed insulin. Premixed insulin works best when there is little day-to-day variability in breakfast, lunch, and dinner (with a small lunch) or when people are so insulin resistant that they are unlikely to develop hypoglycemia after smaller meals. Premixed insulin may rarely be used as initial insulin therapy for patients in whom a simplified insulin regimen is desirable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1752.html" rel="external">"General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus", section on 'Pre-mixed insulins'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Premixed rapid-acting preparations may be slightly less effective for glycemic management than adequately titrated basal and bolus insulin. In an open-label trial, 708 patients with type 2 diabetes who were suboptimally managed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9621" href="/z/d/drug information/9621.html" rel="external">metformin</a> and a sulfonylurea were randomly assigned to premixed biphasic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9020" href="/z/d/drug information/9020.html" rel="external">insulin aspart</a> (twice daily), prandial insulin aspart (three times daily), or basal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9022" href="/z/d/drug information/9022.html" rel="external">insulin detemir</a> (once or twice daily). There was no difference in median A1C levels among the three groups (7.1, 6.8, and 6.9 percent, respectively), but significantly more patients in the basal and prandial groups achieved an A1C level ≤6.5 percent than in the premixed biphasic group (43, 45, and 32 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The majority of all three treatment groups used a second type of insulin, per protocol, during the trial to obtain the stipulated glycemic goals. Patients in the basal group had the fewest episodes of hypoglycemia. In other trials, premixed rapid-acting preparations were more often associated with minor hypoglycemia and weight gain than long-acting insulin or oral agents [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Premixed insulin should always be dosed before meals because the fast-acting component is meant to cover prandial intake. To initiate, calculate the total daily dose based on weight (0.2 units per kg [minimum 10 units, up to 15 to 20 units] daily) or based on prior insulin dose. One approach is to administer two-thirds of the total daily dose before breakfast and one-third before dinner. Premixed insulin should be dosed relative to meal intake and may need to be reduced for smaller meals. For example, depending on the meal pattern (eg, small breakfast, large dinner), it may be appropriate to switch the ratio and give as little as one-third before breakfast and as much as two-thirds before dinner.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The initial dose is adjusted based on glucose monitoring. If pre-lunch and pre-dinner hyperglycemia persist, the morning dose can be increased by 2 to 3 units every two to three days. The pitfall is that targeting pre-dinner hyperglycemia may result in pre-lunch hypoglycemia, highlighting the challenge of using premixed insulin formulations. Consequently, it may be necessary to relax glycemic targets to use premixed insulin safely.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intensive insulin regimens</strong> – If intensive insulin therapy is chosen in a patient with type 2 diabetes, the pretreatment considerations, choice of regimen, and management issues are similar to those for patients with type 1 diabetes. For people who are very hyperglycemic, it is not necessary to achieve euglycemia rapidly. Advancing the regimen slowly (over weeks rather than days) reduces the risk of hypoglycemia as glucotoxicity resolves, allows a slow osmotic re-equilibration, and enables the patient to learn to use insulin safely.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Insulin pump therapy is used infrequently in patients with type 2 diabetes, but it may have a role in a select group of patients with poorly managed type 2 diabetes taking multiple daily injections or for people with limited dexterity when someone is available to help set up the device [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Intensive insulin and insulin pump therapy are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The use of automated insulin algorithms may facilitate more timely dose adjustments. A smart pen insulin delivery device (which uses aspart or lispro cartridges) is available for people who use multiple daily insulin injections.

Both of these scenarios can lead to obligate snacking, which may fuel insulin-associated weight gain. This problem may be identified by asking whether patients have symptoms of hypoglycemia when meals are skipped or snack to prevent hypoglycemia. Other potential hypoglycemia triggers (eg, changes in diet or activity, alcohol use) should be identified.

The resulting weight gain worsens insulin resistance and may prompt insulin dose escalation, leading to a vicious cycle.</p><p>The magnitude of the weight gain depends upon the intensity of regimen (dose and frequency of insulin) and the dietary pattern [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), the average weight gain after 10 years of insulin therapy was approximately 7 kg for patients with type 2 diabetes, with the most rapid weight gain occurring when insulin was first initiated [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. Less intensive therapy with either insulin or a sulfonylurea (which increases endogenous insulin secretion) was associated with a 3.5 to 4.8 kg weight gain at three years versus no change with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9621" href="/z/d/drug information/9621.html" rel="external">metformin</a> monotherapy [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p>Weight gain with basal insulin alone generally appears modest. As examples: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the GRADE trial, patients who were randomly assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9023" href="/z/d/drug information/9023.html" rel="external">insulin glargine</a> aiming to maintain A1C &lt;7 percent exhibited weight stability over a mean follow-up of five years (mean 0.61 kg body weight loss) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Notably, however, individual responses to therapy differ, as 13.1 percent of glargine-treated patients experienced body weight gain ≥10 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another trial, weight gain was greater with prandial than basal insulin (4.8 versus 3.1 kg) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]; patients receiving prandial insulin also received a higher insulin dose, which could account for the small difference in weight gain. In other trials, premixed rapid-acting preparations (containing prandial insulin) were more often associated with weight gain than long-acting insulin or oral agents [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Available data suggest that the benefits of insulin therapy for glucose lowering outweigh the adverse effects conferred by modest weight gain. Microvascular complications were reduced with insulin monotherapy in the UKPDS despite weight gain [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. In type 1 diabetes, intensive insulin therapy in Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) resulted in major reductions in microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease (CVD) despite weight gain [<a href="#rid78">78</a>]. A subsequent analysis of the DCCT data, however, revealed that the CVD benefit of intensive therapy was attenuated by weight gain beginning after approximately 14 years of intensive therapy [<a href="#rid79">79</a>].
