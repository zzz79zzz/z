The most common causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy are compressive intervertebral disc herniation and degenerative spondylosis. </p><p>This topic will review the etiologies, clinical features, and diagnosis of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. The treatment and prognosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5259.html" rel="external">"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features and management of nonradicular disorders of the lower spine are discussed elsewhere.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7782.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of low back pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7780.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute low back pain"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7770.html" rel="external">"Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lumbosacral spine</strong> – The lumbar spine consists of five movable lumbar vertebral bodies, numbered L1 to L5. The sacrum is made up of five developmentally fused vertebral levels (S1 to S5), followed by a terminal bony prominence, the coccyx. The entire region is commonly described as the lumbosacral spine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Directly beneath each lumbar and sacral vertebra, there is a pair of neural foramina with the same number designation, such that the L1 neural foramina are located just below the L1 vertebral body. Neural foramina are bounded superiorly and inferiorly by pedicles, anteriorly by the intervertebral disc and vertebral body, and posteriorly by facet joints  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123" href="/z/d/graphic/66123.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95403" href="/z/d/graphic/95403.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Through each neural foramen passes the same-numbered spinal nerve root, recurrent meningeal nerves, and radicular blood vessels. On each side there are five lumbar, five sacral, and one coccygeal spinal nerve root(s).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nerve fibers</strong> – All lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots originate at the T10 to L1 vertebral level, where the spinal cord typically terminates at the conus medullaris  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50257" href="/z/d/graphic/50257.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). For patients with congenital spinal deformities such as spina bifida, the conus medullaris may be displaced more downward toward the middle of the lumbar spine due to tethering to ligamentous or bony structures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Spinal nerve roots</strong> – A dorsal (somatic sensory) root from the posterolateral aspect of the spinal cord and a ventral (somatic motor) root from the anterolateral aspect of the cord join in the spinal canal to form the spinal nerve root  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123" href="/z/d/graphic/66123.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The nerve roots then course down through the intraspinal canal, forming the cauda equina, until they exit at their respective neural (intervertebral) foramina. Thus, the lumbosacral nerve roots exit the spinal canal at a lower level than where they arise from the spinal cord  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50257" href="/z/d/graphic/50257.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). A potential consequence of this arrangement is that intraspinal pathology may affect roots at higher levels than the level where the roots exit [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cell bodies</strong> – Cell bodies of the motor nerve fibers are located in the ventral (anterior) horns of the spinal cord, while those of the sensory nerve fibers are in a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) at each lumbar and sacral level. DRGs tend to be located within the neural foramina and are therefore not strictly speaking intraspinal (ie, within the lumbar canal). However, at the low lumbar and sacral levels, there is a tendency for DRG to reside proximal to the neural foramina, within the intraspinal canal, as found in 11 to 38 percent of cases at L5 and 71 percent at S1 [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The DRGs are attached to the vertebral body on the transverse process [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Compressive radicular disease typically occurs proximal to this.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Rami</strong> – Just distal to the neural foramen, the nerve root divides in two, forming the dorsal and ventral primary rami.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>The small dorsal (posterior) primary ramus supplies motor innervation to the paraspinal muscles and cutaneous innervation to the skin of the trunk and back</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>The large ventral (anterior) primary ramus supplies motor and sensory innervation to the legs and trunk, including abdominal wall muscles</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The dorsal rami of the spinal nerves also supply the apophyseal joints and the paraspinal muscles. They innervate structures both above and below the level of the nerve. Clinical evaluation of injury to the dorsal rami is difficult because of the overlap in areas innervated by these nerves and the limited ability to clinically evaluate individual paraspinal muscles. However, electromyography (EMG) can be helpful in determining the distribution of disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The ventral rami innervate the extremities and the trunk. These branches can be evaluated by assessing the motor and sensory functions of the different myotomes and dermatomes, respectively. However, variability to the dermatomal and myotomal distribution of innervation exists [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Myotomes and dermatomes</strong> – The collection of muscles with significant innervation from a single root is called a myotome  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64209" href="/z/d/graphic/64209.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Similarly, the sensory distribution of a single root is labeled a dermatome  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The primary manifestations of lumbosacral root disease can be broken up into dysfunction of two distinct systems: motor and sensory. Motor dysfunction from a root lesion may cause weakness in some or all muscles innervated by that root. However, many muscles have innervation from multiple roots, which may result in preserved strength despite significant impairment of a single root. Similarly, there is substantial individual variability in the distribution of specific dermatomes. Careful clinical and/or electrodiagnostic evaluation of multiple muscles and sensory regions may be needed to identify the spinal innervation. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3355057462"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF NERVE ROOT DYSFUNCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radiating pain from a spinal nerve injury is mediated through dysfunction at proximal spinal nerves. Compression of a spinal nerve root by disc, arthritic spur, or inflammation from other processes leads to local edema and ischemia, which impair neuronal transmission. These factors contribute to the production of pain impulses through the spinal nerves. The pain from acute spinal nerve compression reflects a combination of pain generation within the nerve root itself as well as the pain from neighboring tissues whose pain fibers are activated by the effect of disc herniation on dura, ligaments, and surrounding vasculature.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spinal sites</strong> – Spinal nerve root compression or other injury may occur anywhere from nerve origins at the end of the spinal cord at the T12-L1 level, down the canal (as the cauda equina), until exiting at the neural foramen  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50257" href="/z/d/graphic/50257.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Specific spinal locations along this pathway include  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123" href="/z/d/graphic/66123.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Central canal (along the cauda equina)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lateral recess</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neural foramen (nerve root canal)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Lumbosacral nerve roots may be compressed as they exit the spinal canal at the neural foramina below their respective vertebrae or several levels above their respective vertebrae along the central canal. However, lumbosacral nerves are most commonly compressed as they descend in the lateral recess one level <strong>above</strong> the exiting level. As examples, the L5 root can be compressed by a central disc protrusion at the L2-3 or L3-4 level, a lateral recess disc protrusion at the L4-5 level, or far lateral disc protrusion into the foramen at the L5-S1 level. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Central canal lesions may cause multiple, bilateral radiculopathies due to the presence of multiple spinal nerve roots in the cauda equina.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nerve root injury may also be complete or partial and thus may involve all or only a subset of root fibers. With a partial injury, incomplete myotomal involvement may result, making the distinction between a radiculopathy and a peripheral nerve injury more challenging.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nerve fiber involvement</strong> – Like most peripheral nerves, lumbosacral nerve roots are composed of both large and small fibers. Different fiber types play different roles by virtue of the information they carry. Injury to these fibers may result in focal demyelination, as seen initially with compression, or axonal damage, as seen with infarction or a more severe compressive injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Large fibers</strong> – Large fibers carry motor efferent and sensory information involved with vibratory sense as well as conscious and unconscious proprioception. The typical clinical findings of large-fiber involvement in radiculopathies are weakness and diminished or absent stretch reflexes. Clinical testing for proprioception and vibratory sense tends to extend across several dermatomes and thus is often not as helpful in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies as small-fiber modalities. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Small fibers</strong> – The smaller myelinated A-delta fibers and unmyelinated C fibers carry pain and temperature information. A-delta fibers transmit cold sensation, while C fibers subserve warm sensation. Isolated injury to these fibers is not common in lumbosacral radiculopathies. However, their dermatomal distributions tend to be more specific than those of the large fibers, underscoring the role of small fibers in the clinical evaluation of radiculopathies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In addition, radicular A-delta and C fiber dysfunction may occur with inflammation, even in the absence of overt nerve root compression. A study of warm and cold sensory thresholds in 32 patients with unilateral L5 or S1 radiculopathy and disc herniation found that warm thresholds (C fiber function) were impaired to a greater extent than cold thresholds (A-delta fibers) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Since it is thought that unmyelinated axons, such as C fibers, are less affected by compression than myelinated ones, this finding suggests that the generation of lumbar radicular pain is mediated by inflammation more than by nerve root compression [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Central pain</strong> – Central pain sensitization may result from nerve root compression. Supporting evidence comes from a small study of patients with L5 or S1 radiculopathy that demonstrated a lowered pain threshold in the contralateral root, perhaps mediated by pre- and postsynaptic modulation of opioidergic interneurons [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lumbosacral radiculopathy is most commonly caused by nerve root compression due to either intervertebral disc herniation or degenerative spondylosis. Other etiologies include nonskeletal causes of nerve root compression and noncompressive mechanisms including infection, trauma, inflammation, neoplasm, and vascular disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2159337946"><span class="h2">Disc herniation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Herniation of an intervertebral disc is a common cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> – Age-related degenerative changes in the spine cause gradual narrowing of the disc space, leading to dysfunction in the intervertebral disc  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74811" href="/z/d/graphic/74811.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). The annulus fibrosis becomes more fibrotic and less elastic, leading to the development of fissures and calcium deposits. The nucleus pulposus becomes desiccated and friable. As the disc shrinks and the intervertebral disc space narrows, the annulus tends to buckle out and/or disc material can be displaced outward and compress a nerve root. These degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc can be classified by appearance and presence of displaced disc material:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Disc bulge</strong> – Buckling of the annulus can involve &gt;90 degrees of the total circumference of a disc. The nucleus pulposus may be intact or partially displaced through a single or multiple layers of the annulus but does not tear through the entire ring with a disc bulge.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Herniation</strong> – Rupture of the nucleus pulposus through the ring of the annulus fibrosus is a true disc herniation. There are two broad categories, protrusion and extrusion. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Protrusion refers to a rupture of disc material in which the base is broader than the dome. In general, this does not extend above or below the disc space. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>An extrusion is a disc rupture in which the dome is wider than the base, with a dumbbell appearance. Extrusions may extend above or below the disc space.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Free fragment</strong> – When herniated disc material loses its connection with the main disc material, free fragments can migrate from the disc space to produce symptoms at adjacent sites.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Susceptibility at specific spinal levels</strong> – The lumbosacral spine is susceptible to disc herniations because of its mobility from flexion, extension, and torsion. Seventy-five percent of flexion and extension occurs at the lumbosacral (L5-S1) joint [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The L5-S1 level, on the other hand, has limited torsion. Twenty percent of flexion and extension occurs at L4-L5. The remaining 5 percent occurs between L1 and L3 [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels are most susceptible to injuries from routine movements of the spine; approximately 90 to 95 percent of compressive radiculopathies occur at these levels [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The incidence of radiculopathies is split somewhat evenly between L4-L5 and L5-S1, as the lack of torsion at L5-S1 helps to increase its stability despite its higher degree of flexion and extension [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Next in frequency is L4. Other levels are uncommon.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Far lateral herniations are seen more often at the L2-4 levels. They may affect the rostral root. This is rare, as only 10 percent of far lateral herniations will result in nerve root compression [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Pain from the far lateral disc herniations may be more severe due to compression of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3384193513"><span class="h2">Degenerative spondylosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Degenerative changes in the joints of the spine (spondylosis) lead to the development of bony overgrowth (osteophytes) that may cause radiculopathy. These degenerative changes occur at three main sites:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The intervertebral joints</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The uncovertebral joints (cervical spine only)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The zygapophyseal (facet) joints</p><p></p><p>Changes at the vertebral body endplates adjacent to the disc accompany disc degeneration (see <a class="local">'Disc herniation'</a> above). The marrow undergoes fibrovascular change or fatty marrow replacement. Eventually, endplate sclerosis develops. Osteophyte formation occurs at the margins of the vertebral bodies. What triggers osteophyte formation is unclear, although spinal movement at ligamentous attachment sites and loss of buffering tissues between bony surfaces likely play roles. Osteophyte production appears to slow as advancing spondylosis leads to decreasing spinal movement.</p><p>Facet joint degeneration may not be directly related to vertebral endplate spondylotic changes but often coexists. Disc degeneration is likely to put additional weight-bearing strains on facet joints, which are not weight-bearing structures. With unnatural movement of the spine, the synovial joint bears more structural burden, degenerates, and develops osteophytes. These osteophytes grow into the posterior aspect of the neural foramen  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77488" href="/z/d/graphic/77488.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).</p><p>These bony changes may directly impinge on spinal nerve roots or cause instability and misalignment of the spine (ie, degenerative spondylolisthesis) that leads to nerve root pain and neurologic deficits  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74811" href="/z/d/graphic/74811.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). It is not known whether changes in these different structures are causally related or occur independently.</p><p>Age-related degenerative spondylosis is more commonly associated with nonradicular low back pain than radiculopathy. It may also cause symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis from osteophytic compression of multiple nerves within the central canal or in the setting of degenerative spondylitic changes associated with anterior displacement with respect to an adjacent vertebral body (spondylolisthesis). These conditions are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7782.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of low back pain in adults", section on 'Nonspecific back pain'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7779.html" rel="external">"Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Congenital and developmental conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital abnormalities of the bony spinal column or its contents occur in 25 to 50 percent of the general population [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Congenital narrowing of the canal can be a common substrate upon which spondylosis may result in radiculopathy, especially among younger adults.

This may include paresthesia, dysesthesia, hyperesthesia, or anaesthesia. Paresthesia occurs in 63 to 72 percent of cases, radiating pain in approximately 35 percent, and numbness in approximately 27 percent [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>].</p><p>Similarly, weakness confined to the muscles in a particular lumbosacral myotome should raise suspicion for radiculopathy, though few people spontaneously report such specific complaints. Instead, patients may report functional impairments suggestive of a specific muscle and nerve root dysfunction. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>L2/L3/L4 – Inability to get up from a chair suggests iliopsoas or quadriceps weakness.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>L3/L4 – Buckling of the knee is consistent with quadriceps weakness. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>L5 – Dragging of the toe points to tibialis anterior weakness.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>S2/S3/S4 – Urinary and/or fecal incontinence may be due to impaired urinary and/or rectal sphincter motor function.</p><p></p><p>Triggers and alleviating factors may also help to suggest a radicular cause to symptoms. Radicular pain that worsens with Valsalva or improves while lying down suggests a compressive etiology. Conversely, radicular pain that worsens with lying down may suggest an inflammatory or neoplastic etiology. However, such symptoms have not been shown to be sensitive or specific for these conditions.</p><p>The acute onset of symptoms with bending, lifting, or trauma may herald a radiculopathy. In large series, approximately 30 to 50 percent of patients identify an inciting event, most commonly nonlifting activities (eg, bending, slipping without falling, vacuuming, recreational sports), heavy lifting, falls, and motor vehicle accidents [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. However, none of these factors are specific for radiculopathy. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h3">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation for lumbosacral radiculopathy requires a careful general and neurologic examination. Additional procedures (eg, straight leg raising, reverse straight leg raising) may be useful, but their specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility are variably limited. Vertebral tenderness is suggestive of infection but is not specific enough to be clinically useful [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General examination</strong> – The spine should be evaluated for any cutaneous abnormalities, such as tufts of hair, nevi, or pores that may be suggestive of a neural tube developmental abnormality.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy from herpes zoster may have an erythematous vesicular maculopapular rash or a history of a rash that precedes onset of dermatomal allodynia [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurologic examination</strong> – The localization of pain, sensory loss, weakness, and reflex loss can help identify dysfunction at specific nerve root levels  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75645" href="/z/d/graphic/75645.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Muscle weakness must be distinguished from ineffective voluntary effort, such as may occur in the setting of severe pain. A radicular pattern of weakness suggests involvement of the ventral root or severe impairment of the nerve. Weakness is a common feature of radiculopathy due to nerve infarction or diabetic amyotrophy. Long-standing radicular weakness may also lead to muscle atrophy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Muscle stretch reflexes should be tested to identify hyporeflexia or areflexia. Side-to-side asymmetries are usually significant. Commonly tested muscle stretch reflexes include the quadriceps (L2/L3/L4) and Achilles (S1). The internal hamstring reflex can be useful in assessing a suspected L5 radiculopathy [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], but its correct performance requires experience. It is sometimes difficult to elicit in patients with obesity. An experienced clinician may try to elicit this reflex by tapping the semitendinosus and semimembranosus (internal hamstring muscles) tendons just proximal to the popliteal fossa. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The sensory examination is more subjective than other parts of the neurologic examination and is further confounded by dermatomal overlap and variability [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. However, there are areas that are exclusively served by individual nerves (autonomous zones). The most important of these in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies include the sole of the foot (S1), dorsum of the foot (L5), medial calf (L4), and anterior thigh (L2 and 3) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. We suggest testing the relevant lumbosacral dermatomes for light touch, pain, and temperature. Vibratory sensation and proprioception are usually not useful for evaluating radiculopathies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Provocative maneuvers</strong> – Specific bedside maneuvers can be helpful in determining whether symptoms are radicular in nature. These include the straight leg raise, the contralateral straight leg raise, and the reverse straight leg raise (also referred to as femoral stretch).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Straight leg test</strong> – The straight leg raise test is done with the patient supine. The examiner raises the patient's symptomatic leg at the hip with the knee extended and the foot dorsiflexed, being careful that the patient is not actively "helping" in lifting the leg. Straight leg raising results in an increase in dural tension in the lower lumbar and upper sacral levels. Pain that occurs or worsens during testing or improves after testing suggests radiculopathy (positive straight leg test). By contrast, radicular pain is absent or unchanged when the hip is flexed with the leg in flexion at the knee. Additional maneuvers may be performed during the straight leg test to help identify radiculopathy:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Lasègue's sign is the presence or worsening of radicular pain (not just low back pain or hamstring pain) with the straight leg maneuver (ie, hip flexion with the leg extended at the knee).

It is most helpful in the evaluation of radiculopathy at the L5 and S1 levels. In a prospective study of 100 patients, Lasègue's sign was positive in 83 percent [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. One study of patients with acute low back pain found that the combination of radiating pain into the leg, sensory loss in the foot, and a positive straight leg raise test was predictive of a herniated disc with nerve root compression [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Contralateral straight leg test</strong> – The contralateral (crossed) straight leg raise test refers to passive elevation of the unaffected leg by the examiner. The test is positive (abnormal) when lifting the unaffected leg reproduces radicular pain in the affected leg.

This maneuver is most useful for evaluating the L2, L3, and L4 roots. However, the value of this test is limited by inadequate information on its sensitivity and specificity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patrick's test</strong> – Patrick's test is a maneuver during which the hip is externally rotated with the ipsilateral knee flexed at 90 degrees and placed on the opposite knee.

The primary neurodiagnostic procedures are nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). Together, they provide insight into the integrity of spinal nerve roots and their connection with the muscles they innervate. These tests are most commonly considered in patients with persistent disabling symptoms of radiculopathy in whom neuroimaging findings are nondiagnostic or inconsistent with the clinical presentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101562" href="/z/d/graphic/101562.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are another neurodiagnostic procedure used infrequently in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy to help localize sensory nerve dysfunction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27"><span class="h4">Nerve conduction studies and electromyography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NCS and EMG can localize the specific spinal nerve root that is damaged, distinguish between old and new axon loss nerve damage, and provide indirect support for the presence of injury, such as demyelinating conduction blocks at the root level [<a href="#rid7">7,49</a>]. Neurodiagnostic testing also can identify conditions that mimic radiculopathy, such as more distal mononeuropathies of the leg or lumbosacral plexopathy. </p><p>NCS and EMG also provide physiologic information, which complements the anatomic information provided by neuroimaging [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. When there is uncertainty in the relationship between abnormal neuroimaging findings and neurologic deficits, NCS and EMG are useful to support or refute this relationship. In particular, EMG may provide objective evidence of denervation when there is no motor deficit or uncertain motor deficit. In addition, EMG findings may help determine the timing of the denervation (eg, distant past versus ongoing). This is particularly useful in patients with past surgery and residual pain. For patients with nonspecific spine pain, EMG can help to distinguish pain-related reduced muscular effort from true neurogenic weakness.</p><p>Specific abnormal findings on NCS and EMG vary according to the nerve root involved.

The needle EMG examination is more sensitive and provides better localizing information than NCS but is not likely to show prominent features of acute axon loss until three or more weeks after symptom onset. This is due to a two- to three-week delay in the development of fibrillation potentials after acute motor axon loss.

In a retrospective comparison of 47 patients who had a clinical history suggestive of either cervical or lumbosacral radiculopathy, there was congruence between EMG and MRI findings in 60 percent of patients [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Each lumbosacral nerve root innervates a specific sensory region, called a dermatome  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) and a group of muscles, called a myotome  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64209" href="/z/d/graphic/64209.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiologies</strong> – Lumbosacral radiculopathy is most commonly caused by nerve root compression due to either intervertebral disc herniation or degenerative spondylosis. Other etiologies include nonskeletal causes of nerve root compression and noncompressive mechanisms such as infection, trauma, inflammation, neoplasm, and vascular disease. (See <a class="local">'Etiologies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Lumbosacral nerve root compression may occur in the central canal, lateral recess, or nerve root canal  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66123" href="/z/d/graphic/66123.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). While lumbosacral nerve roots exit the spinal canal at the neural foramina below their respective vertebrae, they are most commonly compressed as they descend in the lateral recess one level above the exiting level. (See <a class="local">'Disc herniation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific radicular presentations</strong> – The clinical presentations of lumbosacral radiculopathy vary according to the nerve root(s) involved  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75645" href="/z/d/graphic/75645.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). L5 and S1 radiculopathies are the most frequent clinical presentations. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>L1 radiculopathy is uncommon. Symptoms typically involve pain, paresthesia, and sensory loss in the inguinal region  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'L1 radiculopathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>L2, L3, and L4 radiculopathies are considered as a group because there is marked overlap of the innervation of the anterior thigh muscles and the L2, L3, and L4 myotomes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64209" href="/z/d/graphic/64209.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Acute back pain is the most common presenting complaint, often radiating around the anterior aspect of the thigh down into the knee  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Weakness of hip flexion and knee extension along with a reduced knee (patellar) stretch reflex may be seen in severe cases. (See <a class="local">'L2/L3/L4 radiculopathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>L5 radiculopathy often presents with back pain that radiates down the lateral aspect of the leg into the foot  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Weakness may be present in foot dorsiflexion, toe extension, foot inversion, and foot eversion. Reflexes are generally normal. (See <a class="local">'L5 radiculopathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In S1 radiculopathy, pain radiates down the posterior aspect of the leg into the foot from the back. Sensation is generally reduced on the posterior aspect of the leg and the lateral edge of the foot  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Weakness may be present in leg extension (gluteus maximus), knee flexion (biceps femoris), and plantar flexion (gastrocnemius). Achilles' tendon (ankle) reflex loss is typical. (See <a class="local">'S1 radiculopathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>S2, S3, and/or S4 radiculopathies are uncommon radiculopathies that may coexist in the setting of a large central disc herniation at a higher level. Patients typically present with sacral or buttock pain that radiates down the posterior aspect of the leg or into the perineum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/z/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Weakness may be minimal, but urinary and fecal incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction may be present. (See <a class="local">'S2/S3/S4 radiculopathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy is clinical, made in patients with compatible symptoms and examination findings  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75645" href="/z/d/graphic/75645.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Diagnostic testing with a contrast-enhanced lumbosacral MRI is typically reserved for selected patients with high-risk features for suspected structural or inflammatory conditions and those with progressive or severe weakness who are at risk for permanent neurologic impairment  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101562" href="/z/d/graphic/101562.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Neurodiagnostic and other testing may be warranted if neuroimaging is nondiagnostic. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic testing for selected patients'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy most commonly includes nonspecific (eg, musculoskeletal) low back pain as well as other neurologic conditions that involve lower extremity nerves, including lumbar spinal stenosis, cauda equina syndrome, diabetic amyotrophy, lumbosacral plexopathy, and mononeuropathies of the leg such as femoral, sciatic, peroneal, and tibial nerve lesions. Systemic infections and other disorders such as cancer or rheumatologic conditions and some abdominal or pelvic conditions may also cause or refer pain to the lumbosacral region  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69498" href="/z/d/graphic/69498.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).
