         Thrombotic events (venous thromboembolism [VTE] and stroke) in children have become increasingly recognized in hospitalized pediatric patients, although they are rare in healthy children [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In most cases of pediatric VTE, there are underlying risk factors  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122844" href="/z/d/graphic/122844.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), the most common of which is the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter. Inherited thrombophilias (IT) also contribute to the risk of VTE; however, the prevalence of IT varies considerably depending upon the specific patient population. An underlying thrombophilia is far more likely in patients with unprovoked VTE compared with provoked (eg, catheter-related).
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to and rationale for thrombophilia testing in children who have had a thrombotic event and those who have a positive family history will be reviewed here. Diagnosis and management of VTE and stroke in children and the approach to IT testing in adults are discussed in separate topic reviews:

          Acquired thrombophilia
         </strong>
         – Acquired thrombophilia refers to acquired laboratory abnormalities that may predispose individuals to developing VTE. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an important acquired thrombophilia, and testing for this disorder should be included when performing thrombophilia testing in the setting of a prior history of VTE. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additional laboratory-based risk factors for VTE that may be included on a "thrombophilia panel" include homocysteine, factor VIII, lipoprotein(a) levels, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels or PAI-1 4G/5G promotor polymorphism. However, as discussed below, we suggest
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         routinely performing these tests when evaluating for thrombophilia in children because guidance is lacking on how abnormal results should influence patient management. (See

         Most pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) episodes occur in hospitalized children with underlying medical conditions, such as prematurity, cancer, congenital heart disease, and infection  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122844" href="/z/d/graphic/122844.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Often multiple VTE risk factors are present, the most common being the presence of a central venous catheter (CVC) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. Though the incidence of pediatric VTE is highest among hospitalized neonates and infants, there is a second "peak" in adolescence. VTE in adolescence often presents in the setting of oral contraceptive use, or it may be unprovoked. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5918.html" rel="external">
          "Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Incidence'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In children with VTE, the prevalence of inherited thrombophilia (IT) varies greatly, ranging from approximately 10 to 60 percent, depending on the population studied and the tests used [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-14
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence is highest in children with unprovoked VTE and lowest in patients with CVC-associated VTE [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common ITs identified in pediatric VTE include factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, antithrombin deficiency, and proteins S and C deficiencies. In two studies including a total of 271 children with VTE, the relative frequencies of individual IT disorders was as follows [

         <strong>
          How likely is it that the child has an IT?
         </strong>
         – As discussed above, most pediatric VTE episodes are associated with underlying medical conditions or provoking circumstances (eg, central venous catheter [CVC], cancer, congenital heart disease, estrogen, infection, trauma, immobilization); the likelihood of IT is highest among children with unprovoked VTE. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Will the test results affect the acute management of VTE?
         </strong>
         – Identification of a thrombophilic defect rarely influences the acute management of a patient with VTE, in whom the mainstay of therapy is therapeutic anticoagulation. The exception would be a neonate with severe (homozygous or compound heterozygous) deficiency of proteins C or S who presents with purpura fulminans, which can be life threatening and requires special interventions.

         With increasing use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS) in pediatric patients with VTE, one issue that may arise is the need to exclude antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), an acquired thrombophilia, prior to treatment (since patients with APS who require long-term anticoagulation are generally treated with

         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, in a patient who has a clinical history suggestive of APS (adolescent with unprovoked VTE, immune mediated cytopenias, or underlying rheumatologic condition) it is reasonable to test for antiphospholipid antibodies prior to using a DOAC. (See

          Will the test results affect the duration of anticoagulation?
         </strong>
         – The decision of how long to continue anticoagulation therapy for VTE in pediatric patients is based largely on the age of the child (shorter treatment courses may be used in neonates compared with older infants and children) and whether the VTE is provoked (ie, associated with a risk factor such as CVC, estrogen, infection, trauma, or immobilization) or unprovoked (unprovoked VTE is generally treated for a longer duration compared with provoked).

         Some patients with IT may benefit from a longer duration of anticoagulation for treatment of VTE. The decision should be assessed on an individual basis, weighing the risk of recurrence against the risk of bleeding. Factors that may influence the decision include the specific thrombophilic defect, age of the patient, whether the thrombus was unprovoked or provoked, and the child's risk of bleeding [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         <strong>
          Are there other benefits of identifying an IT?
         </strong>
         – Identification of IT may help provide insight as to why the child developed thrombosis, particularly if the event was unprovoked. This information may help to inform decisions about thromboprophylaxis during future high-risk situations. In addition, patients and families often appreciate information about an underlying thrombophilia as an explanation for why a thrombosis occurred. Lastly, discovery of an inherited defect will allow other family members to be counseled on their potential risk, allowing them to make an informed decision on whether or not to be tested. Testing of other children in the family who are asymptomatic is discussed further below (see
         <a class="local">
          'Asymptomatic children with a positive family history'

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         performing thrombophilia testing in this group of patients. The presence of CVC is the strongest risk factor, and treatment decisions do not depend upon test results. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 observational studies found that while the overall prevalence of IT was low and while IT was associated with increased likelihood of CVC-associated VTE, the association was largely accounted for by a relatively high prevalence of elevated factor VIII, which may represent an inherited disorder or may be acquired (since factor VIII is an acute phase reactant and is often transiently elevated after an acute thrombosis) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of most other IT traits in the meta-analysis was low and the association with CVC-related VTE was relatively weak. Based on the available evidence, we suggest not routinely performing IT testing to inform management decisions in children with CVC-related VTE. A possible exception is a child with a strong family history of VTE (VTE in first-degree relative &lt;40 years of age) who develops CVC-related VTE, in whom IT testing may be considered. (See

         Thrombophilia testing is best performed after recovery from the acute VTE to avoid an incorrect diagnosis. However, as previously discusses, in patients suspected to have APS, testing for antiphospholipid antibodies may be considered prior to initiating a DOAC, because if positive, an alternative anticoagulant is warranted [
         <a href="#rid17">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the acute setting, results of thrombophilia testing are challenging to interpret because they can be influenced by the thrombosis itself and by the effects of anticoagulants and other comorbid conditions (eg, infection, cancer)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef88805" href="/z/d/graphic/88805.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Therefore, any non-DNA-based test that is abnormal during the acute setting should be repeated later, ideally off anticoagulation. The diagnostic accuracy of molecular mutation testing is not affected by these factors, so these tests can be sent even during an acute episode. (See

          'Clinical implications of a positive result'

During the study's follow-up, the "carriers" experienced 31 risk periods (eg, trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization) and the "noncarriers" experienced 20 risk periods. Neither spontaneous nor risk-related VTE occurred in either group during 395 and 296 observation years, respectively. However, circumstances where pediatric VTE most commonly occurs (eg, CVC, cancer, cardiovascular surgery) were not encountered in any subjects during the study period.

          Whom to test
         </strong>
         – For individuals who have a strong family history of VTE or IT (eg, VTE in a first-degree relative &lt;40 years old), we suggest IT testing if there are additional risk factors or underlying medical problems that place them at risk for thrombosis (cancer, CVC, trauma, or major surgery). In this setting, knowing that the child has an IT is helpful because it may alter therapy (eg, avoidance of CVC, targeted thromboprophylaxis). In addition, it is reasonable to perform thrombophilia testing in adolescent girls with a strong family history of IT or VTE, particularly if they are on or considering an estrogen-containing contraceptive.

         For patients who test positive for an IT, clinical decisions about anticoagulation depend on the strength of the thrombophilia and the strength of the family history. In general, patients with laboratory-only evidence of high-risk IT are not given long-term prophylactic anticoagulation. However, they require special management for the following special situations, which are discussed in greater detail separately:

         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         ]. Protein C levels in particular typically remain "low" throughout early childhood and do not reach adult levels until adolescence.

         When interpreting levels of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin, particularly in infants in whom physiologic values are changing rapidly over time, there are rarely "absolute cutoffs" that are useful. Often the normal range overlaps with values found in adults with heterozygous defects, and retesting is required as the child matures [

         ]. Pediatric reference ranges are often not available for tests that are performed in most laboratories. While published, age-related normal values exist, it is important to be aware that direct comparison of test results from different laboratories is often not appropriate because of the use of different reagents and measuring instruments.

          Other VTE risk factors

         – The most common risk factor for VTE is the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). Other risk factors include prematurity, cardiac disease, inflammation, infection, nephrotic syndrome, cancer, surgery, trauma, use of oral contraceptives, immobilization, and structural venous abnormalities  (

          Asymptomatic children with a family history of IT
         </strong>
         – For individuals who have a strong family history of VTE or IT (eg, VTE in a first-degree relative &lt;40 years old), we suggest IT testing if there are additional risk factors or underlying medical problems that place them at risk for thrombosis (cancer, CVC, trauma, major surgery). In this setting, knowing that the child has an IT is helpful because it may alter therapy (eg, avoidance of CVC, targeted thromboprophylaxis). In addition, it is reasonable to perform thrombophilia testing in adolescent girls with a strong family history of IT or VTE, particularly if they are on or considering an estrogen-containing contraceptive.
