This results in an elevation of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and other metabolic waste products that are normally excreted by the kidney. In addition, if urine output is also diminished, fluid retention and volume overload may result.</p><p>The initial assessment of patients with AKI and management of the major complications of AKI are discussed here.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stages the severity of AKI from stage 1 (mild) to stage 3 (severe)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83168" data-inline-graphics="83168" href="/d/graphic/83168.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7238.html" rel="external">"Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults"</a>.)</p><p>In general, the complications associated with AKI are more severe and life threatening with higher stages of AKI. However, all patients with AKI are at risk for complications and for the possibility of milder AKI progressing to more severe AKI. The initial steps of urgent management depend upon whether the patient is in the hospital or in an outpatient setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2402172620"><span class="h2">Triage of outpatients with acute kidney injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the outpatient setting, the initial evaluation of the patient with AKI is directed at triaging the patient to the appropriate setting, such as the emergency department for more severe disease or life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities.

A patient suspected of having GN should be seen by a nephrologist within one to two days. However, if the AKI is thought to be due to other etiologies, an initial evaluation within one week is reasonable. If expedited nephrology follow-up cannot be obtained, then the patient should be referred to the emergency department.</p><p>In addition, patients who have a history of recent admission to the hospital for evaluation and management of AKI should also be seen by a nephrologist in the outpatient setting for longitudinal follow-up and secondary prevention of AKI. These patients are at risk for recurrent AKI, which is discussed at length elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7225.html" rel="external">"Kidney and patient outcomes after acute kidney injury in adults", section on 'Recurrent AKI'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2500612706"><span class="h2">Evaluate need for urgent kidney replacement therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients needing management of life-threatening fluid and electrolyte abnormalities due to AKI should be started on kidney replacement therapy (KRT) immediately.

However, since KRT often cannot be immediately provided, such patients usually require medical treatment during the period prior to the initiation of KRT. Appropriate measures are discussed in sections below or in other topic reviews, to which links are provided.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H878287644"><span class="h3">Hypervolemia with pulmonary edema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who present with AKI and who have severe hypoxia due to pulmonary edema often need KRT urgently. Some patients may respond quickly to loop diuretics and may therefore avoid the need for KRT. For patients who are oliguric and hemodynamically stable, we use 80 to 200 mg of intravenous (IV) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">furosemide</a> or equivalent and monitor for an increase in urine output  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120718" href="/d/graphic/120718.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). We consider a urine output of greater than 200 mL within two hours of the furosemide dose as adequate. Accurate urine output monitoring is therefore important, and in some patients, bladder catheter placement may be necessary.</p><p>If a lower dose (eg, 80 mg) is given and does not induce an adequate response, then a higher dose (eg, 200 mg) should be given without delay. Hypervolemic patients with pulmonary edema who do not respond adequately to diuretics should be prepared for KRT without delay.</p><p>Dosing strategies for diuretics in the setting of AKI have not been formally developed and therefore require a cautious consideration of side effects such as ototoxicity. In addition, the purpose of the diuretics in this setting is to relieve hypervolemia. There is no evidence that use of diuretics reduces the incidence or severity of AKI. In addition, diuretics may help categorize the severity of the kidney injury. In a study of 326 patients with AKI, the need for diuretics was associated with a higher risk of death or nonrecovery of kidney function (odds ratio [OR] 1.77, 95% CI 1.14-2.76) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Nonresponsiveness to diuretics was defined as the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">furosemide</a> dose equivalent of 1 mg per mL of daily urine output (eg, 200 mL urine output in response to 200 mg of furosemide equates to dose equivalent ratio of 1 mg per mL). Patients with a ratio of 1 or higher on the day of nephrology consultation had higher odds of death or nonrecovery compared with nonusers of diuretics (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.61-5.36). By contrast, patients with a dose equivalent ratio of less than 1 experienced no significant increase in risk (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.79-1.68). These data suggest that continued use of loop diuretics is not warranted in patients with no increase in urine output and that diuretic unresponsiveness may be a marker for increased severity of AKI. Other studies have reported similar findings [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>].</p><p>Many patients with AKI have hypervolemia that is not severe enough to warrant emergency KRT. Management of hypervolemia in such patients is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Hypervolemic patients'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3321594819"><span class="h3">Severe hyperkalemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with AKI who have a serum potassium &gt;6.5 mEq/L or those with symptoms or signs of hyperkalemia (ie, cardiac conduction abnormalities, muscle weakness) should be dialyzed urgently (preferably with hemodialysis), in addition to receiving rapidly acting therapies (ie, insulin and glucose, intravenous calcium) and gastrointestinal potassium binders  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109740" data-inline-graphics="109740" href="/d/graphic/109740.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). In addition, patients with AKI and hyperkalemia &gt;5.5 mEq/L should be dialyzed urgently if there is ongoing tissue breakdown (eg, rhabdomyolysis) or ongoing potassium absorption (eg, significant gastrointestinal bleeding). The use of potassium-binding resins to treat acute hyperkalemia in the setting of AKI to avoid the need for KRT has not been well studied and cannot be recommended.

Restrictions on potassium, phosphorous, and sodium intake are applicable to most patients with AKI. Given the complexities of nutritional support in these patients and the individual needs of a given patient, we obtain a nutrition consult in hospitalized patients with stage 3 AKI to best tailor therapy. For patients with lesser stages of AKI, the need for consultation should be based upon an individual needs assessment.

Protein requirement increases with the severity of the underlying illness and with initiation of KRT. Whereas nondialysis patients with only mild to moderate illness require only 0.8 to 1.2 g/kg per day, critically ill patients or patients who are on KRT generally require 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg per day or more [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

Other than an increased incidence of nasogastric tube obstruction and high gastric residual volumes among dialyzed patients, there was no difference in gastrointestinal and mechanical complications in the three groups. The mean amounts of nonprotein calories and protein intake for dialyzed patients were 23.4 kcal/kg and 0.92 g/kg, respectively, with the amount of delivered protein calories being slightly less than planned.

Given the nonspecific nature of the uremic symptoms and signs, elimination of other causes is essential before KRT is initiated, especially in the absence of another indication. However, a pericardial rub or effusion is a strong indication to start KRT, as noted above.

The decision to start KRT based upon one of these symptoms is usually difficult. This is especially true for critically ill patients in whom neurologic dysfunction may be attributable to many causes. Thus, KRT initiation should be approached with a clear goal of monitoring whether or not putative uremic symptoms improve with therapy.
