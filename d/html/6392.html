The AHA guidelines are based upon the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) consensus on science, which performs a continuous evidence evaluation process and publishes periodic focused updates to the AHA PALS guidelines.</p><p>The PALS content includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overview of assessment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognition and management of respiratory distress and failure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognition and management of shock</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognition and management of cardiac arrhythmias</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognition and management of cardiac arrest</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postresuscitation management of patients with pulmonary and cardiac arrest</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Review of pharmacology</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3635342266"><span class="h1">PREVENTION OF CARDIAC ARREST</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should primarily focus on prevention of cardiopulmonary failure through early recognition and management of respiratory distress, respiratory failure, and shock that can lead to cardiac arrest due to progressive hypoxia, acidosis, and ischemia. Pediatric early warning scores and rapid response teams (RRTs) provide institutional support for early recognition of deterioration in hospitalized children. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1305283596"><span class="h2">Pediatric early warning scores</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For hospitalized children, we suggest use of validated pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) to identify those patients whose condition may be worsening [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. PEWS are frequently used by hospitals that care for children in conjunction with pediatric RRTs to monitor the behavioral, cardiovascular, respiratory status and degree of medical support of their pediatric patients during hospitalization. Increasing PEWS suggest that a child's clinical condition is worsening. PEWS scoring systems typically recommend interventions based on thresholds that suggest or require specific actions. Several validated PEWS are in use [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. </p><p>In an international randomized trial of 21 pediatric hospitals that compared use of the Bedside Paediatric Early Warning System (BedsidePEWS) with no severity of illness score over 550,000 patient-days, hospitals that implemented the BedsidePEWS had fewer significant clinical deterioration events such as emergency endotracheal intubation, fluid resuscitation, or initiation of CPR (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97) but no significant difference in all-cause mortality [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. In the 2022 Consensus on Science systematic review and meta-analysis of PEWS (12 studies), in addition to the trial mentioned above, pooled results from cohort studies found similar results [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, in all studies, the rates of mortality were low, and all point estimates suggested that, although not statistically significant, mortality may be increased in hospitals that do not use PEWS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2754917960"><span class="h2">Rapid response teams</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For hospitals that care for children, we suggest use of a pediatric rapid response team (RRT). This recommendation places a high value on preventing clinical deterioration in children despite the resources needed to implement these systems. A RRT, also known as a medical emergency team (MET), consists of personnel from medical, nursing and/or respiratory therapy who have critical care training and are available 24 hours per day, seven days a week for evaluation and treatment of patients who are located in non-critical care settings (eg, medical or surgical inpatient wards) and show signs of clinical deterioration. Implementation of an RRT has been promoted as a major strategy for improving patient safety in hospitals [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Infants and children with high-risk conditions who are managed on general inpatient units may benefit from RRTs that can provide prompt assessment and management if clinical deterioration occurs although results from large studies are not consistent [<a href="#rid1">1,2,9-12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of five pediatric prospective observational studies with a total of 347,618 patient admissions found that implementation of an RRT was associated with a significant reduction in deaths from cardiac arrest when compared with historical control periods (0.05 versus 0.17 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, decreased mortality after implementation of an RRT was not found in all studies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A cohort study of 29,294 patient admissions (7257 admissions after institution of an RRT) that was included in the meta-analysis compared hospital-wide mortality rates and rates of respiratory and cardiopulmonary arrests outside of the intensive care unit before and after implementation of an RRT in a 264-bed freestanding children's hospital [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Major findings included:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The mean monthly mortality rate decreased from 1 to 0.8 deaths per 100 discharges (18 percent decrease, 95% CI 5-30 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The mean monthly code rate (respiratory or cardiopulmonary arrest) decreased from 2.5 to 0.7 codes per 1000 patient admissions (RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7). A possible explanation for this finding is that early activation of the RRT in a critically ill patient might have prevented codes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Over 18 months, the RRT was activated 143 times, most commonly for respiratory distress, hypotension, hypoxemia, altered mental status, and tachycardia. The most common actions by the RRT were respiratory support, fluid resuscitation, airway management, and transfer to the intensive care unit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A multicenter, prospective observational study of the implementation of a clinician-led pediatric RRT in four pediatric academic centers found that initiation of an RRT was associated with a significant reduction in pediatric intensive care unit mortality rate after readmission from a medical or surgical unit (0.3 to 0.1 deaths per 1000 hospital admissions) but no significant decline in the rate of cardiopulmonary arrests [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p>However, these observations do not prove that the RRT was responsible for the improvement in outcomes. Support for this concern comes from an observational study in a children's hospital that did <strong>not</strong> implement an RRT but also found a significant reduction in mortality over the same time period in which other pediatric centers reported decreased mortality in association with RRT implementation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In a separate multicenter study that evaluated predicted versus actual hospital mortality rates in 38 free-standing children's hospitals before and after implementation of an RRT and that controlled for declining mortality over time, RRT implementation was not associated with a reduction in hospital deaths beyond what was predicted by preimplementation trends [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Thus, the benefit of an RRT is not consistent across all settings, and it is possible that explanations other than the RRT may be responsible for at least part of the benefit. The quality and generalizability of the evidence describing the effectiveness of implementing RRTs is also limited by features such as before and after observation design, selection of primary and secondary outcome measures, and varied indications for RRT activation. In addition, because the mortality following pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission is typically low, its utility as an outcome measure may be limited. Finally, the systems being studied are complex, making it difficult to identify confounding factors such as changes in secular trends or indirect benefits derived from the RRT implementation. Thus, institutions may choose to implement and maintain RRTs based upon their own safety priorities and resources. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The assessment of respiratory distress and circulatory compromise in children, including the common findings, is covered in greater detail separately.

A decline in EtCO<sub>2 </sub>during resuscitation may indicate inadequate effectiveness of compressions, dislodgement of an endotracheal tube, or disruption of pulmonary blood flow (eg, massive pulmonary embolus). Whether EtCO<sub>2</sub> has similar ability to identify the quality of CPR during pediatric resuscitations and specific values to guide therapy have not been established [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/278.html" rel="external">"Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults", section on 'Intra-arrest monitoring'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/273.html" rel="external">"Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)", section on 'Effectiveness of CPR'</a>.)</p><p>In pediatric patients with a declining EtCO<sub>2</sub>, efforts to improve the quality of compressions and to avoid excessive ventilation are appropriate. Thus, in addition to monitoring rate and clinical effectiveness of ventilation, we use EtCO<sub>2</sub> measurements from continuous waveform capnography whenever possible during pediatric cardiac arrest. Sudden, sustained increases in EtCO<sub>2 </sub>during CPR are associated with a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/273.html" rel="external">"Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)", section on 'Return of spontaneous circulation'</a>.)</p><p>In adults, measurements of arterial relaxation provide a reasonable approximation of coronary perfusion pressure. During CPR, a reasonable goal is to maintain the arterial relaxation (or "diastole") pressure above 20 mmHg. Similarly, in adult patients, central venous oxygen saturation (SCVO<sub>2</sub>) provides information about oxygen delivery and cardiac output. During CPR, a reasonable goal is to maintain SCVO<sub>2</sub> above 30 percent (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/278.html" rel="external">"Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults", section on 'Intra-arrest monitoring'</a>). Data from other physiologic monitors are less likely to be available in children with pulseless arrest, but measurements obtained from arterial and central venous catheters can provide useful feedback about the quality of CPR and the presence of ROSC. Published evidence from analysis of hemodynamic monitoring data during in-hospital pediatric CPR has found an association between a mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of &gt;25 mmHg in infants young than one year of age and &gt;30 mmHg in children one year of age and older and survival to discharge, as well as survival to discharge with favorable neurologic outcome [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

Our approach is to activate ECPR after approximately 5 to 10 minutes of failed conventional resuscitation in patients with conditions that may be reversible after a period of mechanical circulatory support (eg, myocarditis, pulmonary or air embolus, sudden arrest after cardiac surgery, poisoning, or primary hypothermic arrest) or who are candidates for the use of ECPR as a bridge to therapies such as cardiac transplantation.</p><p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with CPR (ECPR) for infants and children with in-hospital cardiac arrests is used in selected institutions with resources to rapidly deploy ECMO when conventional resuscitation efforts are unsuccessful [<a href="#rid1">1,2,28,29</a>]. A single-institution series of 56 patients undergoing ECPR (almost 80 percent of patients with structural cardiac disease) showed a survival to discharge of 66 percent and a reasonable quality of life at a median of 38 months [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Other observational studies also indicate improved outcomes only for patients with underlying cardiac diseases (eg, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or congenital cardiac anomalies) [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>]. For such patients, intact survival approaching 50 percent has been described [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Furthermore, intact survival has occurred even after prolonged periods of chest compressions (&gt;60 minutes) in these patients.

However, the study pooled patients with cardiac and noncardiac etiologies even though ECPR was much more likely to be used in surgical cardiac patients. When these groups were analyzed separately, only the cardiac patients had statistically significant improved outcomes.

Recurrent shock should be managed according to physiologic endpoints (eg, skin perfusion, quality of pulses, blood pressure, urine output and mental status). Of note, cardiogenic shock occurs frequently in survivors of cardiac arrest. If hypovolemia is suspected in a patient with cardiogenic shock, the clinician should carefully infuse 5 to 10 mL/kg of isotonic fluids (eg, normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> or Ringer's lactate) over 10 to 20 minutes followed by reevaluation of endpoints.

Evidence indicates that blood glucose should be maintained below this threshold, but the role of "tight control" that uses insulin to achieve a specified blood glucose range is of uncertain value in children after cardiac arrest [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. If performed, tight glucose control requires close monitoring of blood glucose and avoidance of hypoglycemia. Intensive insulin therapy in adults to maintain a blood glucose range of 80 to 110 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L) increases the risk of hypoglycemia without demonstrated benefit.

As an example, nonconvulsive status epilepticus was found after cardiac arrest in 6 of 19 children in one series [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].

After cardiac arrest in children, we suggest active temperature control to maintain core body temperature ≤37.5°C (99.5°F). Based upon the available evidence and international resuscitation guidelines, for comatose infants and children after cardiac arrest, it is reasonable to <strong>either</strong> provide five days of temperature control with normothermia (temperature 36 to 37.5°C [96.8 to 99.5°F]), or to provide two days of temperature control with hypothermia (targeted temperature range 32 to 34°C [89.6 to 93.2°F]) followed by three days of temperature control with normothermia [<a href="#rid1">1,2,5,27</a>]. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal temperature target and duration of active temperature control. </p><p>Regardless of the chosen approach, elevation in temperature &gt;37.5°C should be strictly avoided. Elevated temperature following resuscitation is associated with worse outcomes in neonates and adult patients and is presumed to be harmful in children as well although there is no direct evidence in this population [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. Fever is common in children after resuscitation from cardiac arrest; thus, defining the target range for temperature and careful core temperature monitoring are indicated. Prompt availability and anticipatory use of cooling blankets and anti-pyretics are routine in our practice.</p><p>Therapeutic hypothermia to maintain core body temperature below normal (typically 32 to 34°C) has been evaluated in children based upon evidence for improved neurologic outcome in neonates and selected adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6216.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy", section on 'Therapeutic hypothermia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13838.html" rel="external">"Initial assessment and management of the adult post-cardiac arrest patient", section on 'Temperature management'</a>.)</p><p>However, the data for therapeutic hypothermia for 48 hours for both out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest have <strong>not</strong> shown improved outcomes. For example, in a multicenter trial involving children who were resuscitated from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 260 patients (48 hours to 18 years of age) were randomized to either therapeutic hypothermia with a target core body temperature of 33°C or therapeutic normothermia to maintain a target temperature of 36.8°C. One year survival with good neurologic function was <strong>not </strong>significantly different in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia compared with therapeutic normothermia (20 versus 12 percent, respectively, relative likelihood 1.54, 95% CI 0.86-2.76) [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. The groups also did not significantly differ with respect to incidence of adverse effects including infections or serious arrhythmias and 28-day mortality. Similarly, these investigators, using the same methodology, found no benefit of therapeutic hypothermia compared with therapeutic normothermia in 329 children resuscitated from in-hospital cardiac arrest [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. This trial was stopped early for futility. Of note, the number of patients randomized in both of these trials was insufficient to exclude an important benefit or harm from therapeutic hypothermia and further study may be warranted. However, pooling of individual patient data from these two trials also did not show a survival benefit from therapeutic hypothermia [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. The lack of benefit from hypothermia may be related to improved outcomes in the control groups of these two trials, both of whom received active temperature control with normothermia, which may also be beneficial in patients with cardiac arrest.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H289870391"><span class="h3">Transfer to a pediatric center</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the child is not being treated in a center with pediatric emergency and critical care expertise, the child should be stabilized and rapidly transferred for definitive care at a regional pediatric center after return of spontaneous circulation.
