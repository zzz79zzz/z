          Mechanical valves

         – Patients with mechanical valves require anticoagulation. This generally involves early bridging with heparin after placement of the valve and long-term therapy with a

         </a>
         ). The target international normalized ratio varies with valve position, valve type, and thromboembolic risk factors  (

          Bioprosthetic valves

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Patients with bioprosthetic valves are generally treated with long-term antiplatelet therapy, with only patients with low bleeding risk with surgical bioprosthetic valves completing a three- to six-month period of anticoagulation after valve implantation. Less commonly, patients with bioprosthetic valves are treated with anticoagulation to treat bioprosthetic valve thrombosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111633.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While long-term anticoagulation is not generally required for a bioprosthetic valve, many patients with bioprosthetic valves have concurrent indications for anticoagulation (eg, atrial fibrillation) and may be treated with a direct oral anticoagulant or VKA, depending upon the indication for anticoagulation and other clinical factors.

         </strong>
         The choice of antithrombotic therapy during the first three to six months after surgical bioprosthetic valve implantation depends upon the patient's bleeding risk. Patients with low bleeding risk are treated with anticoagulation (generally with early heparin bridging followed by VKA therapy); if the bleeding risk is elevated, patients are treated with

          Transcatheter aortic valves

         ), although some patients have bleeding at therapeutic or even subtherapeutic INR levels. However, rapid reversal of anticoagulation, leading to subtherapeutic INRs, increases the risk of mechanical valve thrombosis and thromboembolism. Given these concerns, we suggest an individualized approach based largely on expert opinion that is similar to the 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and 2021 European Society of Cardiology valve guideline recommendations [

         </strong>
         – For patients who are not bleeding and have an INR &gt;5 and ≤10, the VKA should be temporarily discontinued to permit a gradual reduction in INR. The INR should be monitored closely so that the VKA can be restarted when the INR reaches the therapeutic range.

         replacement has been preferred to the intravenous route, as it will result in a more gradual decrease in the INR and lessen the chance of a subtherapeutic INR and risk of thromboembolism. However, low-dose intravenous vitamin K (1 to 2.5 mg) can be used to safely lower INRs &gt;6 [

         In patients with a mechanical valve who are bleeding with a therapeutic or supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR), the risk of serious complications from major bleeding (eg, not amenable to local control, life threatening, causing hemodynamic instability) must be weighed against the risk of valve thrombosis.

         – Bleeding in patients who are therapeutically anticoagulated or overanticoagulated often comes from an anatomic or pathologic cause (eg, gastrointestinal lesion, urinary infection) that should be identified and treated.

         – If the risk from continued bleeding that is inaccessible to timely local control (particularly intracerebral hemorrhage) is considered greater than the risk of valve thrombosis, reversal of anticoagulation should be accomplished by the use of the combination of both:

          Resumption of anticoagulation

         – The optimal time to resume anticoagulation (and to start heparin prior to VKA therapy) after a major bleeding episode is uncertain. Considerations include the site and cause of the bleeding and interventions performed to stop the bleeding or treat its cause. Decisions are individualized with close consultation between the cardiologist or cardiac surgeon and clinicians treating the bleeding episode. (See

         For most patients with a bioprosthetic valve who are receiving anticoagulation, the purpose of the anticoagulation is for a concurrent condition, such as atrial fibrillation, rather than to prevent valve thrombosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consequently, the approach to management of bleeding in most anticoagulated patients with bioprosthetic valves is generally the same as the approach for other anticoagulated patients receiving a VKA or a direct oral anticoagulant. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1324.html" rel="external">

         antagonist (VKA) and requires emergency surgery (or other invasive procedure) that entails a significant bleeding risk, reversal of anticoagulation is often required. An emergency procedure is defined as one that is required as soon as feasible, generally within a few hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to use a reversal agent depends on the thrombotic and bleeding risks (see
         <a class="local">
          'Procedures with more than minimal risk of bleeding'
         </a>
         below), with the understanding that both risks are increased in patients with prosthetic heart valves who require emergency surgery. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         If used, prompt reversal of VKA can be accomplished by administering an intravenous four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), which acts rapidly (estimated onset of 5 to 15 minutes), or a plasma product such as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), which likely takes longer to be effective since it takes longer to infuse [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,8
         </a>
         ]. Given the results of the randomized trial discussed below, four-factor PCC is preferred for VKA reversal [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to a rapidly acting product (PCC or plasma), low-dose (1 or 2 mg) oral or intravenous

          vitamin K
         </a>
         may be administered. The effect of vitamin K is slower because it promotes synthesis of active clotting factors (within 24 hours for oral vitamin K; generally within 4 to 6 hours for intravenous vitamin K [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]), but, once given, its effects on VKA reversal are longer lasting than FFP or PCC (several days for vitamin K versus 6 to 8 hours for PCCs or plasma) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. We use a lower dose of vitamin K in patients with mechanical valves than in the general population because this allows us to minimize the time it takes to reanticoagulate the patient with VKA after surgery is completed. This is especially important in individuals with mechanical heart valves due to their high risk of thrombosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk of thromboembolism'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Support for a four-factor PCC over FFP comes from an open-label, randomized multicenter trial involving 181 patients (16 percent with prosthetic heart valves or prosthetic joints) who were receiving a VKA, had an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;2, and needed rapid reversal of anticoagulation for an urgent surgical or invasive procedure; in this trial, a single dose of a four-factor PCC was shown to be superior to FFP in rapid INR reduction and hemostasis [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. All patients received

          vitamin K
         </a>
         , and the doses of PCC and FFP were based on INR and patient weight. Effective hemostasis was achieved in 90 percent in the PCC group versus only 75 percent of patients in the FFP group (difference 14.3 percent, 95% CI 2.8-25.8). The safety profile was similar for both treatments, with thromboembolism in 7 percent of PCC-treated patients versus 8 percent of FFP-treated patients. However, the applicability of this study to patients with prosthetic heart valves may be limited since most patients were receiving VKA therapy for other indications.

        <p>
         The discussion here applies primarily to patients with mechanical valves, since anticoagulation for a bioprosthetic valve is indicated only in patients with low bleeding risk during the first three to six months after implantation and in patients with bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, with management considerations similar to those for mechanical valves.

         VKA therapy is generally continued in patients undergoing pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) surgery. In patients at moderate to high risk of thromboembolism undergoing nonemergency surgery for pacemaker and ICD surgery, the BRUISE CONTROL trial, which randomly assigned these patients to heparin bridging or continued VKA, found that device pocket hematomas were significantly more common in the heparin-bridging group [

         The acceptable level of anticoagulation in patients with prosthetic heart valves undergoing cardiac catheterization depends on the specific procedure being performed. Many patients with a mechanical valve undergoing cardiac catheterization do not require bridging anticoagulation with heparin, since no or only minor modification of VKA dosing is required for low- to moderate-risk procedures. (See

         The management of anticoagulation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is discussed separately. Similar considerations apply to patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography for suspected coronary artery disease. (See

         The VKA is restarted as soon after the procedure as prudent, typically 12 to 24 hours after the procedure. It will take a few days for the INR to reach a therapeutic level. As noted above, bridging with heparin is not generally required for patients with low or moderate thromboembolic risk.

         Much of the available data on perioperative management of patients with prosthetic valves are from small, uncontrolled case series that often include patients with older-generation prosthetic valves. In these reports, thromboembolic risk was variable, depending upon the type and location of the valve prosthesis and upon a number of patient-specific clinical factors.

         and were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or dalteparin postoperatively until the INR was ≥2.0. Among patients with a mechanical valve, there were similar rates of major thromboembolism (0 versus 0.7 percent) and major bleeding (2.0 versus 0.7 percent) in the groups without and with postoperative bridging.

         In an earlier meta-analysis of 34 studies and one randomized trial with a total of 12,278 patients (24 percent with a mechanical valve), the risk of thromboembolic events was similar in bridged and nonbridged groups (odds ratio [OR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.42-1.54), but bridging was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (OR 3.60, 95% CI1.52-8.50) [

         Limited data are available on outcomes of bridging therapy in individuals with mechanical valves. In observational studies of patients with mechanical valves receiving perioperative heparin bridging, the pooled incidence of acute thromboembolic complications was 0.9 percent (95% CI 0.2-1.5) and of major bleeding was 2.8 percent (0.8-4.8) [

         – Bleeding in patients who are therapeutically anticoagulated or overanticoagulated often comes from an anatomic or pathologic cause (gastrointestinal lesion, urinary infection) that should be identified and treated. (See

         – Advance planning and close communication with patients and providers is needed regarding the timing of anticoagulant changes and follow-up testing. (See

          Delay after recent valve placement

         – The risk of thromboembolism is highest in the first few months after mechanical or bioprosthetic valve replacement or valve repair. Waiting at least three months after valve surgery for elective noncardiac surgery, when feasible, may reduce thromboembolism risk. (See

          Assessing bleeding and thrombotic risks
         </strong>
         – Decisions regarding anticoagulant discontinuation and heparin bridging in the patient with a mechanical valve (or anticoagulated to prevent bioprosthetic valve thrombosis) are based on the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism. The tables summarize patient and procedural bleeding risks  (
