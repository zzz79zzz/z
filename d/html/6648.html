(See <a class="local">'Measures of tumor burden'</a> below.)</p><p>Those on clinical trials require more frequent and specialized testing as detailed by trial protocol and guidelines from the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111430" href="/d/graphic/111430.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55362" href="/d/graphic/55362.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Baseline measurement</strong> – Baseline tumor burden is measured prior to therapy using the serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and the serum free light chain (FLC) assay. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring disease</strong> – Initially, tumor burden is monitored at the start of each treatment cycle. Once it has been confirmed that the disease is responding, these assessments can be done every few cycles. Tumor burden is measured using the SPEP and either the serum FLC assay or the UPEP. Many patients and clinicians find the serum FLC assay to be more convenient than the UPEP, although the correlation between these tests is not perfect. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Serum M protein measurements cannot be used alone because some patients who had detectable serum M protein on presentation will only show light chains on UPEP or serum FLC assay at the time of relapse. This is called "light chain or Bence Jones escape" [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients followed preferentially with SPEP and serum FLC assay, the UPEP should still be performed periodically (eg, every six months) for validation and to check for other renal issues such as albuminuria. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Serum and urine immunofixation should be done in addition once the serum and urine electrophoresis, respectively, shows no measurable protein. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bone marrow biopsy and imaging are reserved for the investigation of suspected complete response or progressive disease. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adjustments for special conditions</strong> – The laboratory should be notified if the patient has received a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="105443" href="/d/drug information/105443.html" rel="external">daratumumab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="127258" href="/d/drug information/127258.html" rel="external">isatuximab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="105610" href="/d/drug information/105610.html" rel="external">elotuzumab</a>). IgG kappa monoclonal antibodies like these may be detected on SPEP and immunofixation assays. The laboratory may be able to modify the assay or use another assay to better estimate the M protein level in this scenario. (See <a class="local">'Serum and urine tests'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Quantitative immunoglobulins may be used to follow tumor burden in certain circumstances (eg, patients with IgA monoclonal protein).

(See <a class="local">'Serum and urine tests'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In such patients, SPEP, serum immunofixation, UPEP, and urine immunofixation are reserved for confirmation of complete response and very good partial response. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bone marrow biopsy and whole body FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography [PET/CT] are reserved for the investigation of suspected complete response or progressive disease. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No measurable M protein or FLC</strong> – A minority of patients (2 to 5 percent) will have no measurable M protein or measurable FLC at baseline. In such patients, tumor burden is assessed by periodic bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (if ≥30 percent plasma cells on bone marrow evaluation) or whole body FDG PET/CT [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The frequency of these studies depends on other clinical parameters (eg, hemoglobin, calcium, and creatinine); patients who are felt to be responding well based on improvement in end-organ function will need bone marrow and imaging assessments less frequently compared with those in whom the response status is less clear. (See <a class="local">'Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although not readily available at most centers, mass spectrometry can quantitate low level M proteins and studies are evaluating whether it can be used to follow disease activity in a subset of these patients [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6655.html" rel="external">"Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins", section on 'Mass spectrometry'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Plasmacytoma</strong> – Rarely, patients with no M protein or FLC measurable will have biopsy-proven plasmacytoma. If such patients have at least one lesion on whole body PET/CT that has a single diameter of ≥2 cm, tumor burden can be followed with whole body PET/CT every three to four cycles until a plateau or complete response is attained. (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4118773427"><span class="h3">Suspected complete response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When a complete response (CR) is suspected, the standard evaluation includes: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SPEP and serum immunofixation </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>24-hour UPEP and urine immunofixation </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum FLC assay</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cross-sectional imaging (eg, whole body FDG PET/CT) only if plasmacytomas present at baseline. </p><p></p><p>Serum and urine studies are required regardless of whether the disease at baseline was measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither. Outside of a clinical trial, urine immunofixation can be omitted in the CR evaluation of patients with measurable serum M protein at diagnosis. In one study of patients achieving negative serum immunofixation, the urine immunofixation was also negative in all of the patients with serum M protein only at diagnosis and 98.6 percent of those with serum and urine M protein at diagnosis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>The bone marrow evaluation uses morphologic evaluation and visual quantitation to assess the percentage of plasma cells. Assessment of the bone marrow for minimal residual disease (MRD) using next-generation flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing is usually reserved for patients on clinical trials. (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> below and <a class="local">'Minimal residual disease assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>A CR requires confirmation of these studies on two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new therapy except for bone marrow assessments, which do need not be confirmed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H939880734"><span class="h3">Suspected progression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When disease progression is suspected based on clinical or biochemical findings, the standard evaluation includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measures of tumor burden – SPEP, serum immunofixation, 24-hour UPEP, serum FLC</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measures of end organ damage – Hemoglobin, serum calcium, and creatinine </p><p></p><p>In addition, imaging studies such as PET/CT, MRI, or whole body low dose CT may be needed if there are concerns for new or worsening bone lesions or plasmacytomas [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

As always, one must be careful when interpreting studies that show improved outcome in responders versus non-responders (eg, detectable MRD versus undetectable MRD) since such comparisons have inherent methodologic flaws that cannot be overcome by increasing the sample size. In general, whether or not a treatment works, "responders" will typically appear to do better than "non-responders." One way of overcoming the bias that exists when comparing responders with non-responders is to perform landmark analysis at time points that ensure that almost all patients have had time to reach the response level being studied.</p><p>Several trials are investigating the use of MRD to guide treatment decisions (eg, escalation and de-escalation of care). As we await results, MRD status cannot drive decisions on whether to continue, alter, or resume therapy. MRD negativity is also not indicative of cure.

In such patients, baseline tumor burden is measured using the serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and the serum free light chain (FLC) assay. (See <a class="local">'Patients with measurable M protein'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">At follow-up, tumor burden is measured using the SPEP and either the serum FLC assay or the UPEP. In patients followed preferentially with SPEP and serum FLC assay, the UPEP should still be performed periodically (eg, every six months) for validation and to check for other renal issues such as albuminuria. Serum and urine immunofixation are used once the electrophoresis shows no measurable protein.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>No measurable M protein</strong> – A subset of patients without measurable M protein at baseline will have an involved serum FLC level ≥10 mg/dL. In such patients, FLC levels are used as the primary measure of tumor burden with each cycle of therapy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Patients without measurable M protein or abnormal FLC can be followed with periodic bone marrow aspirate and biopsy or whole body FDG PET/CT.

A whole body FDG PET/CT is also performed if plasmacytomas were present at baseline. (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Suspected progression</strong> – When disease progression is suspected, the standard evaluation includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Measures of tumor burden – SPEP, serum immunofixation, 24-hour UPEP, and serum FLC </p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Measures of end organ damage – Hemoglobin, serum calcium, and creatinine </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Bone marrow studies are not always necessary but should be performed if there is doubt about the disease status, to investigate changes in cytogenetics, or to determine eligibility for clinical trials.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited role for MRD monitoring</strong> – Assessment of the bone marrow for minimal residual disease (MRD) using next-generation flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing is usually reserved for patients on clinical trials. While MRD status is prognostic, data from randomized trials are not available to support using MRD results to guide treatment decisions. (See <a class="local">'Minimal residual disease assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Response criteria</strong> – The International Myeloma Working Group response criteria are used to define response to therapy as stringent complete, complete, very good partial, and partial  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55362" href="/d/graphic/55362.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).
