With type B aortic dissection, the intimal tear originates in the aorta distal to the subclavian artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115" href="/z/d/graphic/100115.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), and because treatment differs, type B dissection must be distinguished from type A aortic dissection.<strong> </strong>Acute type B aortic dissection is usually suspected clinically based on history and physical examination when a patient presents with severe, sharp, or "tearing" chest or back pain. A diagnosis of acute type B aortic dissection can easily be overlooked among patients with acute chest pain, and a high index of suspicion is needed to make a timely diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy. Better awareness and advances in imaging have improved the diagnosis. </p><p>The goals of initial medical management of acute type B aortic dissection are to control pain and limit the extension of the dissection using anti-impulse therapy. We agree with major interdisciplinary guidelines that generally suggest reserving intervention (surgical or endovascular) for those who develop complications related to the dissection (eg, dissection extension, malperfusion, aneurysm formation, persistent pain [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15184.html" rel="external">"Surgical and endovascular management of acute type B aortic dissection"</a>.)</p><p>Acute type B aortic dissection is distinguished from chronic type B aortic dissection based on the duration from initial onset of symptoms.<strong> </strong>The management of acute (hyperacute, acute, subacute) type B aortic dissection is reviewed. The management of chronic type B aortic dissection is discussed separately.

Determining the location of the aortic dissection, duration since onset of symptoms/occurrence, severity of symptoms, and etiology are important, as these impact prognosis and management. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H691579067"><span class="h2">Classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aortic dissection is classified based upon the anatomic location of the entry tear, the clinical severity of the dissection (uncomplicated, complicated), and the duration of symptoms (hyperacute, acute, subacute, chronic) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These all impact the options for and timing of treatment. </p><p>The anatomic location and extent of the aortic dissection are determined using cardiovascular imaging. When the diagnosis is suspected, clinically, the diagnostic evaluation should be accomplished as promptly as possible. For hemodynamically stable patients, computed tomographic (CT) angiography is chosen because of its high sensitivity and availability in most emergency departments where most patients initially present. Gated CT is preferred to eliminate motion artifacts. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable, bedside transesophageal echocardiography can be used with high sensitivity but is often not immediately available. Diagnostic imaging is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection", section on 'Cardiovascular imaging'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Location of entry tear</strong> – The DeBakey and Stanford (Daily) systems were commonly used to classify aortic dissection  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115" href="/z/d/graphic/100115.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The Stanford system, which has been more widely used, classifies dissections that involve the ascending aorta as type A, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear; all other dissections are classified as type B. Approximately one-third of aortic dissections present as type B, and two-thirds are type A [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]<strong>.</strong> The DeBakey and the Stanford aortic dissection classification systems have limitations [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Both are relatively nonspecific regarding the precise extent of the dissection and are ambiguous regarding the involvement of the aortic arch. A task force commissioned by the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and Society for Thoracic Surgery (STS) has addressed these issues with the distinction between type A and type B aortic dissection predicated based on entry tear location alone  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef126986" href="/z/d/graphic/126986.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Type B aortic dissection is defined as an entry tear in a zone &gt;1, and the proximal and distal extent are noted. Therefore, in the SVS/STS system, dissections that originate in the arch (zone 2, 3) can be considered type B dissections and are managed surgically and medically, depending on presentation and clinical course. Type A aortic dissection is classified as an entry tear in zone 0, and the distal extent can range from zone 1 to 12. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration from onset</strong> – Acute type B aortic dissection is distinguished from chronic type B aortic dissection based on the duration from the onset of symptoms [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In the past, type B aortic dissection was classified simply as acute (&lt;14 days) or chronic (&gt;14 days), which was based on the timing of death in the era of open surgery. The SVS/STS reporting guidelines have provided additional classifications based on the timing from the onset of symptoms as follows [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hyperacute: &lt;24 hours</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute: 1 to 14 days</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Subacute: 15 to 90 days</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chronic: &gt;90 days</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For the purposes of our discussion, we will use the term "acute" type B aortic dissection to refer to the period ≤14 days encompassing the hyperacute and acute periods.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical severity</strong> – Clinical features of acute type B aortic dissection include severe, sharp, or "tearing" chest or back pain that may or may not be associated with evidence of end-organ ischemia. Clinical features of acute aortic dissection and the features that may distinguish between type A and type B aortic dissection are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Type B aortic dissection is considered complicated if there is evidence of malperfusion, rapid expansion or aneurysmal degeneration of the aortic wall, impending or frank rupture, uncontrolled pain, or refractory hypertension (persisting despite ≥3 classes of antihypertensives at max doses) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of patients presenting with type B aortic dissection are acutely complicated [<a href="#rid1">1,5,8</a>]. Complicated acute type B aortic dissection requires urgent intervention. (See <a class="local">'Complicated type B dissection'</a> below and <a class="local">'Intervention'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">All other type B aortic dissections are considered uncomplicated. Uncomplicated type B aortic dissection is generally managed with optimal medical therapy, which includes pain control and strict blood pressure and heart rate control (also referred to as "anti-impulse therapy") [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Despite intensive medical therapy, 20 to 40 percent of patients may progress to require surgical or endovascular intervention. (See <a class="local">'Referral or transfer'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H772442951"><span class="h2">Supportive care and monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood pressure management typically requires intensive care monitoring with an arterial line for strict heart rate and blood pressure control and may also include monitoring central venous pressure and cardiac indices, depending upon the patient's clinical and hemodynamic status. Routine laboratories are obtained and trended and include complete blood count, electrolytes, coagulation parameters, and D-dimer, as well as markers of malperfusion, including liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], bilirubin), renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine), and lactate. </p><p>For patients with uncomplicated disease, medical therapies are continued until pain abates and heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled. Any increase in pain or recurrence of pain should raise suspicion that the dissection has propagated, prompting repeat cardiovascular imaging. Other clinical features that may indicate the development of malperfusion syndromes include abdominal findings consistent with intestinal ischemia (eg, abdominal pain), renal ischemia (worsened renal function), peripheral ischemia (eg, pain, pallor, diminished/absent pulses) and spinal cord ischemia (eg, paraparesis/paraplegia, which is rare). Also rare are symptoms consistent with involvement of the proximal aorta due to retrograde dissection (eg, aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection", section on 'Symptoms and signs'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection", section on 'Ascending versus descending aortic involvement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H722180991"><span class="h2">Anti-impulse therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anti-impulse therapy consists of heart rate (&lt;60 beats per minute) and blood pressure (&lt;120/80) control to decrease aortic wall shear stress and to minimize the tendency for the dissection to propagate and the development of complications (eg, aneurysmal degeneration, rupture). Combination antihypertensive drug therapy is usually required. Medications and dosing used to treat acute aortic dissection are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111189" href="/z/d/graphic/111189.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The initiation of acute medical therapies should not interfere with timely transfer when immediate intervention is indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8178.html" rel="external">"Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes", section on 'Acute medical management'</a>.)</p><p>Decreasing the force of myocardial contraction has been shown to slow aortic expansion and possibly rupture after aortic dissection, and this has been the basis for prescribing beta-blockers as first-line antihypertensive therapy for patients with thoracic aortic dissection [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>]. Although not evaluated in controlled trials, we suggest a target heart rate &lt;60 beats per minute and target blood pressure of less than 120/80 mmHg [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Patients with optimal heart rate (&lt;60 beats per minute) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; &lt;120 mmHg) control have better outcomes with reduced rates of aortic expansion and rupture [<a href="#rid2">2,15</a>]. In addition to beta-blockers, aortic expansion and survival are improved for patients who receive calcium channel blockers for maintenance therapy [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. In a review of 18 studies that evaluated factors associated with aortic expansion over a median time period of 51.6 months in patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection, the use of calcium channel blockers was among several factors including tight heart rate control (&lt;60 beats/min) associated with negative or limited aortic expansion [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p>Once control of heart rate has been achieved and the patient is tolerating an oral diet, intravenous beta blockers (or other antihypertensive) therapy can be transitioned to an oral route. All patients should be maintained on lifelong therapy to maintain heart rate and systemic blood pressure goals [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p>While approximately 71 percent of patients who sustain type B aortic dissection have a SBP &gt;150 mmHg on initial presentation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], about 90 percent of patients are normotensive with anti-impulsive therapy at discharge, achieving recommended values for SBP of between 100 and 120 mmHg [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3105982468"><span class="h2">Exercise limitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Though unproven, avoidance of strenuous physical activity that would lead to a spike in blood pressure (eg, dynamic resistance training, isometric exercise) is also recommended for <strong>all</strong> patients who have had aortic dissection as another method to minimize aortic shear stress.

Experienced cardiovascular specialists and their team should be involved early in the care of the patient. Clinicians caring for the patient must be aware of the appropriate management of type B aortic dissection to determine if a need for transfer and/or intervention is present. If appropriate services are not available at the institution to which the patient presented, interfacility transfer to a tertiary aortic center should be initiated for any patient with complicated type B aortic dissection. Anti-impulse therapy should be continued during transfer. </p><p>Whether patients presenting with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection should be monitored and treated at an aortic center is unsettled. This would be the ideal situation, particularly since it cannot be known in advance whether an uncomplicated presentation will become complicated, and initial care at an aortic center would avoid delays in treatment for those who develop complications. Experienced teams at high-volume aortic centers are more likely to provide improved diagnostic capabilities and broader treatment options. In one series of 86 patients treated at an aortic center, 24 of 64 patients (38 percent) initially presenting as uncomplicated type B aortic dissection progressed to complicated dissection at a median interval of 7.1 days (95% CI 2-14), 10 patients had malperfusion, 3 had aortic rupture, 8 had early expansion &gt;4 mm, 2 had refractory pain, and 1 had uncontrollable hypertension [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. </p><p>While there are few studies evaluating referral and outcomes, treatment at a tertiary aortic center is felt to be important to achieve optimal outcomes [<a href="#rid23">23-27</a>].

In a systematic review, outcomes of endovascular intervention were much better at centers that had performed more than 20 endovascular procedures compared with fewer [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Overall, in-hospital mortality was 13 percent for type B aortic dissection, with most deaths occurring within the first week. Despite improvements in medical care and the introduction of endovascular management, overall in-hospital mortality for type B dissection did not change significantly over the 20-year period studied. However, the percentage of patients being medically managed fell (from 75 to 57 percent). This change in practice may be due to results of the INvestigation of STEnt grafts in patients with Aortic Dissection XL (INSTEAD-XL) trial, after which more and more centers moved towards a more aggressive thoracic endovascular aortic repair treatment paradigm, even though a mortality benefit was not demonstrated.

Some surgeons support individualized treatment that accounts for many patient factors (eg, life expectancy, extent and location of entry tear, size of aorta, technical complexity of thoracic endovascular repair). For patients who have stabilized on medical therapy (ie, subacute period) and without malperfusion or other complications, they suggest that early endovascular intervention can reduce or eliminate the false lumen, which may impact long-term outcomes, though this has yet to be definitively demonstrated [<a href="#rid34">34,38-50</a>]. </p><p>Long-term survival with medical therapy is approximately 60 to 80 percent at four to five years [<a href="#rid12">12,36,51,52</a>] and approximately 40 to 45 percent at 10 years [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>]. These less-than-desirable outcomes are in part related to issues of adherence with prescribed medical therapies and the natural history of type B aortic dissection. Spontaneous healing of the dissection, characterized by disappearance of the false lumen due to complete thrombosis, is overall uncommon in medically treated patients [<a href="#rid53">53,54</a>]. Continued flow through the false lumen (patent false lumen), either without thrombosis or partial thrombosis, has been postulated to prevent healing and lead to worse prognosis [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>]. The relationship between false lumen patency and outcomes was evaluated in 201 hospital survivors of acute type B aortic dissection enrolled in IRAD [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. Partial thrombosis was present in 34.9 percent, and complete patency of the false lumen occurred in 56.7 percent. Mortality at a median 2.8 years follow-up was 31.6 percent for patients with partial thrombosis and 13.7 for patients with a patent false lumen. In a later review of 11 cohort studies, a residual patent false lumen increased the risk for aortic events in patients with acute aortic dissection (hazard ratio [HR], 5.43, 95% CI 2.95-9.99) and was an independent predictor of long-term mortality in patients with type B aortic dissection (HR 2.79, 95% CI 1.80-4.32) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Partial false lumen thrombosis was also associated with increased long-term mortality (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.37-3.65).</p><p>In the INSTEAD trial [<a href="#rid34">34,56</a>], while there were no statistically significant differences at two-year follow-up between the endovascular and medical groups for overall survival (89 versus 96 percent), favorable aortic remodeling was seen in 91.3 percent of the endovascular group compared with only 19.4 percent of the medically treated patients. With longer-term follow-up of five years (INSTEAD-XL), all-cause mortality was again not significant for endovascular versus medical treatment (11.1 versus 19.3 percent) [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. However, aorta-specific mortality (6.9 versus 19.3 percent) and progression (27 versus 46.1 percent) were significantly lower for endovascular compared with optimal medical treatment alone. Another trial that assigned 61 patients to best medical therapy or best medical therapy plus endovascular stent-grafting reported significantly fewer events of the combined endpoint of incomplete/no false lumen thrombosis, aortic dilation, or aortic rupture for those who were treated with stent-grafts (per protocol results) [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. Technical failures, loss to follow-up, and crossovers from the best medical therapy group limited the analysis. A later meta-analysis that included observational and randomized trials comparing best medical therapy and endovascular repair for acute/subacute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection reported similar rates for inpatient mortality and early reintervention [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Best medical therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of early stroke, whereas endovascular repair was associated with a lower risk of late all-cause and aorta-related mortality. </p><p>The optimal timing for early intervention is not known for certain. However, aortic remodeling is more favorable for intervention performed for acute or subacute type B aortic dissection compared with chronic type B aortic dissection.

(See <a class="local">'Complicated type B dissection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Uncomplicated type B aortic dissection</strong> – For most patients who are hemodynamically stable with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection, we suggest ongoing medical therapy, rather than early endovascular intervention (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, the patient and clinician may reasonably choose endovascular intervention in addition to ongoing medical therapy to prevent malperfusion or other aortic complications, placing more value on potentially improved aortic outcomes in the long term over potential perioperative complications (eg, stroke, spinal cord ischemia). Factors that may influence decision making include the age of the patient, life expectancy, medical risk, and the presence of certain anatomic factors that may increase the risk for future aortic events. The optimal timing for early intervention when it is selected is unknown. (See <a class="local">'Uncomplicated type B dissection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surveillance imaging</strong> – For patients with type B aortic dissection who are being managed medically, we generally perform a baseline thoracic magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomographic (CT) angiography prior to discharge. Follow-up surveillance imaging is obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter to detect complications. We generally prefer MR, particularly in younger patients, but CT angiography is an alternative. (See <a class="local">'Surveillance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Identifying associated genetic conditions</strong> – Patients with thoracic aortic dissection, particularly younger patients and others without an identifiable etiology for aortic dissection (eg, severe hypertension, pregnancy/delivery, aortic trauma), should be evaluated  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105596" href="/z/d/graphic/105596.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) for possible underlying genetic (Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome) or familial disorders (<em>SMAD3</em> mutations, familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection) known to be related. These may increase the patient's individual risk of progression or complications. Screening first-degree family members for aortic aneurysm or bicuspid aortic valve should also be considered. (See <a class="local">'Identifying associated genetic conditions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-term outcomes</strong> – Mortality associated with complicated acute type B aortic dissection can exceed 60 percent. Short-term mortality is clearly higher among those who require intervention; however, long-term survival rates among patients who are discharged are similar regardless of management. Long-term survival is impacted by compliance with anti-impulse therapies, the natural history of the dissection, as well as preexisting medical comorbidities (eg, smoking, hypertension, atherosclerosis, underlying connective tissue disorders).
