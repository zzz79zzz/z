In the United States, this has generally been taken to mean the absence of breast development by age 12 to 13 years in females or absence of testicular enlargement by age 13 to 14 years in males. However, the timing of pubertal onset varies substantially within and across different populations and the family history and population background should be incorporated into decisions regarding the evaluation and therapy of pubertal disorders.</p><p>The most common cause of delayed puberty is a functional delay in production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamic neuronal networks that initiate the episodic or pulsatile release of the GnRH and activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This delay may be due to individual genetic variations, known as constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), or other functional defects, such as undernutrition or chronic illness. Other causes of delayed puberty include a variety of hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal disorders.</p><p>The evaluation and management of an adolescent with delayed puberty is thus essentially an exercise in excluding pathologic causes, as discussed in this topic review. Other clinical presentations of hypogonadism are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7403.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7462.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17171365"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H569777119"><span class="h2">Delayed puberty</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Delayed puberty is defined clinically by the absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics by an age 2 to 3 standard deviations above the mean age of onset of puberty, ie, by an age at which 97 to 99 percent of children of that sex and culture have begun sexual maturation. In the United States, this corresponds to an upper limit of 12 to 13 years for breast development in females [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>] and of 13 to 14 years for testicular enlargement in males [<a href="#rid1">1,5-7</a>]. The age for undertaking a clinical evaluation for delayed puberty, like that for precocious puberty, depends on individual factors including family history and body weight. Onset of pubic hair is not usually included in this definition, because this is typically a sign of adrenarche rather than true puberty. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5849.html" rel="external">"Normal puberty"</a>.)</p><p>However, there are wide ranges within and across populations as to the order and temporal sequences that occur during puberty, especially in females. In females, this range is due in part to the fact that some features of the earliest elements of sexual maturation (pubic hair, axillary hair and odor, and acne) are manifestations of adrenal androgen secretion (termed adrenarche). Clinical adrenarche typically occurs approximately six months after the start of true puberty (ie, ovarian maturation that is followed by breast development, which results from <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> secretion by the ovaries). Hence, some females have early breast development but little else for some time, whereas others follow closely the typical sequence of events described by Tanner [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4092339194"><span class="h2">Stalled puberty</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Puberty can be considered "stalled" if it was not completed within approximately four years of its onset. Approximately 95 percent of healthy children complete their full pubertal development within four years [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In the clinical setting, an evaluation may be initiated before this threshold is reached if there is no evidence of pubertal progression for a sustained period of time (eg, for two or more years).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3457347198"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>By definition, delayed puberty occurs in approximately 5 percent of apparently healthy individuals in a given population.

Rarely, it is caused by defects in the molecular structure of LH and FSH or defects in their membrane receptors on gonadal cells.

This family of disorders is characterized either by deficient gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion or by pituitary disease. Both lead to deficient secretion of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary, which results in deficient gonadal steroid secretion and deficient gametogenesis. This category is sometimes called "central" hypogonadism.</p><p>Causes of secondary hypogonadism include:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2405642217"><span class="h3">Constitutional delay of growth and puberty</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) is the most common cause of delayed puberty and is due to a transient functional defect in production of GnRH from the hypothalamus, caused by individual genetic variations in the ensemble of hypothalamic and pituitary genes controlling sexual maturation. CDGP tends to have familial patterns of inheritance, often following an autosomal dominant pattern such that family members from multiple generations often have a history of "late blooming," with an onset of puberty and pubertal growth spurt that are delayed compared with their peers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5832.html" rel="external">"Causes of short stature", section on 'Constitutional delay of growth and puberty'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3623012513"><span class="h3">Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Isolated GnRH deficiency, also known as idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, can be caused by a variety of genetic mutations. Approximatively 50 percent of patients have associated anosmia (absent sense of smell), known as Kallmann syndrome. Other congenital anomalies including midline defects (cleft lip/palate), neurosensory hearing loss, synkinesia (alternating mirror movements), unilateral renal agenesis, or skeletal defects including syndactyly and ectrodactyly (lobster claw deformity) can be associated with isolated GnRH deficiency at variable frequency. The clinical presentation of these genetic defects varies considerably depending on the causative gene but may include microphallus and/or cryptorchidism in males at birth, a consequence of GnRH deficiency in utero, and absent or stalled pubertal development in males and females [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. These disorders may have different familial patterns of inheritance, although many cases appear to be sporadic because of the variable clinical presentation and/or inability to obtain a detailed family history. The hypogonadism is usually permanent but may be reversible later in life in approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Genetics and other details are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7465.html" rel="external">"Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)", section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>Isolated GnRH deficiency is initially a diagnosis of exclusion but, in approximately 50 percent of patients with Kallmann syndrome, can be confirmed by identification of mutations in specific genes. In patients with unexplained hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a presumptive diagnosis of isolated GnRH deficiency can be made in patients with suggestive physical features (microphallus and/or cryptorchidism, anosmia, unilateral renal agenesis, synkinesia, or skeletal defects) or a family history of isolated GnRH deficiency or those in which puberty has not begun by age 17 years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7465.html" rel="external">"Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In patients under 17 years old who lack any of these characteristic phenotypic features, it may be difficult to distinguish isolated GnRH deficiency from CDGP. Furthermore, these classes of delayed pubertal disorders are likely to have some degree of genetic overlap. This is suggested by the observation of higher rates of CDGP in families with isolated GnRH deficiency [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] and reports that some cases of apparent CDGP are associated with heterozygous mutations in a gene associated with isolated GnRH deficiency [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2387594247"><span class="h3">Other forms of functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This may be associated with an underlying medical condition such as poor nutrition (including anorexia nervosa), chronic illness (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease), hypothyroidism, and excessive exercise. Affected patients typically have delayed but spontaneous pubertal development.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3346115895"><span class="h3">Hypothalamic or pituitary disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, such as malformations, hemochromatosis, injury, or tumors (especially craniopharyngioma) can cause secondary hypogonadism.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although measurement of serum gonadotropin levels and gonadal sex steroid levels can usually differentiate primary from secondary hypogonadism, making a definitive diagnosis of a specific cause of delayed puberty associated with secondary hypogonadism during adolescence can be difficult. Because most of these disorders have in common a decrease in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion and/or its action, no single test except for serial observations over time reliably distinguishes patients with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), who will eventually progress spontaneously through puberty, from patients with other causes of delayed puberty, particularly those with isolated GnRH deficiency [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. In addition, because some cases of well-documented isolated GnRH deficiency undergo spontaneous reversals after being treated with sex steroids, these distinctions between CDGP and isolated GnRH deficiency are becoming less absolute [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7465.html" rel="external">"Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)", section on 'Reversal of IHH'</a>.)</p><p>As a result, the first step in the evaluation is a complete history and physical examination to determine whether further biochemical testing or imaging studies are needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Key questions to ask during the history are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is pubertal development totally absent, or did it start and then "stall"?</strong> – Assessment of the patient's growth pattern up to the time of evaluation is critical, with review of the height-for-age growth chart and calculation of height velocity (cm/year), compared with their peers of the same chronologic age  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 graphicRef96366" href="/z/d/graphic/96367.html" rel="external">figure 1A-B</a>). Similarly, ask whether there have been any signs of pubertal development, such as some initial breast development or tenderness in females, that subsequently disappeared. Isolated androgen-mediated sexual characteristics (such as pubic and/or axillary hair, acne, and apocrine odor) may be the first signs of puberty but usually reflect adrenarche. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5832.html" rel="external">"Causes of short stature"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with CDGP have delayed (not stalled) pubertal development, with slow progression of skeletal growth, adrenarche, gonadal maturation, and bone age that is delayed compared with their peers. In contrast, adolescent-aged patients with tumors in the hypothalamic-pituitary region may present with stalled pubertal development.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the patient have nutritional habits or a medical illness or engage in intense exercise that delayed the onset or slowed the tempo of puberty?</strong> – Undernutrition or high-intensity exercise (eg, long-distance running) are common causes of pubertal delay in otherwise healthy adolescents. Delays in sexual maturation and height velocity often can be the first clinical signs of underlying disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hypothyroidism, or psychosocial deprivation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease often have gastrointestinal symptoms such as loose or bloody stools or abdominal pain, but the symptoms may be subtle. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5879.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5893.html" rel="external">"Growth failure and pubertal delay in children with inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Chronic opioid use is associated with hypogonadism. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7460.html" rel="external">"Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males", section on 'Opioids'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the patient have any congenital abnormalities or neurologic symptoms?</strong> – Some patients with isolated GnRH deficiency have associated anomalies including microphallus, cryptorchidism, midline defects, synkinesia, and/or renal agenesis [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Neurologic symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, dyskinesia, seizures, and intellectual disability may also occur and, if present, strongly suggest a central nervous system disorder. (See <a class="local">'Hypothalamic or pituitary disease'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7465.html" rel="external">"Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)", section on 'Congenital abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is there a family history of delayed or absent puberty?</strong> – A family history of delayed puberty is common in both CDGP and isolated GnRH deficiency, and, in some cases, the disorders may have similar genetic mechanisms (see <a class="local">'Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency'</a> above). In CDGP, parents or siblings give a history of being "late bloomers," with a late growth spurt or late puberty compared with their peers. This typically has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, with or without incomplete penetrance [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Isolated GnRH deficiency can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive manner. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7465.html" rel="external">"Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the patient have a normal sense of smell?</strong> – Absent sense of smell (anosmia) strongly suggests Kallmann syndrome, which is a subtype of isolated GnRH deficiency [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Careful assessments of height, weight, arm span, and secondary sex characteristics are the most relevant aspects of the physical examination. Early signs of sexual development unnoticed by the patient (such as testicular growth) may permit reassurance and avoidance of a costly evaluation in the otherwise normal child. Serial measurements of height and testicular size or breast development made over one or two years will help to confirm the presence or absence of pubertal changes and their progression as well as clarify the diagnosis.</p><p>Both standing height and arm span should be measured to determine if the body proportions are eunuchoid, indicated by an arm span exceeding the height by more than 5 cm. This finding suggests delayed epiphyseal closure secondary to hypogonadism (eg, due to Klinefelter syndrome). Increased arm span is also a feature of Marfan syndrome, but Marfan syndrome is not associated with hypogonadism. The height should be plotted on growth charts that include normal growth patterns with centiles or standard deviation scores  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63399 graphicRef77249" href="/z/d/graphic/63399.html" rel="external">figure 2A-B</a>) to place the current height in the proper developmental context and to allow comparison with both current and subsequent bone age determination. The height velocity should be carefully documented for at least six months or longer, if possible.</p><p>Secondary sexual characteristics should be staged according to the sexual maturity ratings, also known as Tanner staging  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005" href="/z/d/graphic/80005.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 graphicRef79782" href="/z/d/graphic/72038.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

Testicular enlargement and increasing testosterone concentrations demonstrate that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are present in sufficient quantities and also excludes testicular pathology. It is unclear whether the pubertal development is spontaneous or is triggered by the testosterone exposure.

The increase in testicular volume during the course of testosterone therapy was accompanied by endogenous GnRH secretion and the occurrence of spontaneous puberty. Skeletal maturation increased only in the males with an initial bone age below the group mean. After cessation of therapy, bone age and sexual development proceeded normally and the males ultimately achieved their predicted mean height. Similar results have been reported in other studies [<a href="#rid38">38,43,46</a>].

The progestin should not be added until there is substantial breast development that is not solely confined to the areolae and full contour breast growth has plateaued, because premature initiation of progestin therapy can compromise ultimate breast growth.</p><p>Once breast growth has plateaued during serial evaluation and menstruation has been established, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9422" href="/z/d/drug information/9422.html" rel="external">estradiol</a> therapy can be discontinued intermittently for one- to three-month periods to determine if spontaneous menstruation occurs, which should happen in females with CDGP. If spontaneous menstruation occurs, the estradiol therapy is stopped.</p><p>Patients who do not develop spontaneous menstruation and who are older than age 18 years likely have isolated (congenital) GnRH deficiency. In this case, full adult replacement therapy with both estrogen and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9817" href="/z/d/drug information/9817.html" rel="external">progesterone</a> should be initiated. Doses and principles of therapy are similar to those for women with primary ovarian insufficiency. Additional details on progestin therapy and maintenance hormone therapy are found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7426.html" rel="external">"Management of primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h4">Growth hormone therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The value of growth hormone therapy in patients without documented growth hormone deficiency is controversial. Serum growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentrations are usually low for chronologic age in patients with CDGP (but not if corrected for the normal range for bone age) and increase in response to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9981" href="/z/d/drug information/9981.html" rel="external">testosterone</a> or estrogen therapy. Patients with isolated (congenital) GnRH deficiency are typically not growth hormone-deficient and do not benefit from growth hormone therapy, since sex steroids will prompt normal increases in their growth axis. Although the administration of growth hormone is less likely to induce epiphyseal closure than sex steroids and may therefore add to adult height, children with delayed puberty grow well when treated with sex steroids alone.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2122877415"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

In the United States, this corresponds to an upper limit of 12 to 13 years for females (for breast development) and of 13 to 14 years for males (for testicular enlargement). (See <a class="local">'Delayed puberty'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Categories and causes</strong> – Primary hypogonadism is characterized by low levels of gonadal hormones and high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary hypogonadism is characterized by low levels of gonadal hormones and low to normal concentrations of LH and FSH and typically is caused by impaired secretion of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Causes of delayed puberty are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62372" href="/z/d/graphic/62372.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Common causes of secondary hypogonadism are:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP)</strong> – This is the most common cause of delayed puberty; it is a transient defect in production of GnRH from the hypothalamus due to physiologic individual variation. Patients with CDGP have delayed (not stalled) growth, adrenarche, sexual development, and bone age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Isolated (congenital) GnRH deficiency</strong> – This can be difficult to distinguish from CDGP between 14 to 16 years. Some patients with isolated GnRH deficiency have anosmia or other associated congenital anomalies, including midline defects (cleft lip/palate), neurosensory hearing loss, synkinesia, unilateral renal agenesis, or skeletal defects including syndactyly and ectrodactyly. (See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The most valuable components of an assessment are a focused history and physical examination as well as observation over time. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>History</strong> – Determine whether pubertal development is totally absent or had started but then "stalled," and solicit information about underlying chronic disease, congenital anomalies (especially midline craniofacial defects or anosmia), and family history of pubertal development. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Determine sexual maturity rating (Tanner stage) of pubertal development  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005" href="/z/d/graphic/80005.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79782 graphicRef72038" href="/z/d/graphic/79782.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>). Calculate the height velocity from serial measurements of height over six months or more. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with absent, stalled, or very delayed puberty should undergo further testing:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bone age</strong> – Bone age determination provides valuable information about the relationship between chronologic age and skeletal maturation. Children with CDGP typically have bone ages approximately 20 percent younger than their actual age. (See <a class="local">'Bone age'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laboratory tests</strong> – These should evaluate for endocrine causes of delayed puberty and screen for nutritional disorders or occult chronic illnesses that may affect hypothalamic GnRH secretions. (See <a class="local">'General laboratory tests'</a> above and <a class="local">'Endocrine tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Additional tests</strong> – In selected patients, head MRI or evaluation for iron overload are appropriate. Patients with primary hypogonadism (elevated LH and FSH) should undergo diagnostic testing for Turner syndrome (females) or Klinefelter syndrome (males). (See <a class="local">'Additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If a specific underlying disorder can be identified  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62372" href="/z/d/graphic/62372.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), therapy should be targeted at that disorder. (See <a class="local">'Patients with specific cause of delayed puberty'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In most patients with secondary hypogonadism and no other abnormalities, the distinction between CDGP and isolated (congenital) GnRH deficiency remains uncertain between 14 and 16 years old and can be resolved only with serial observations. Short-term hormonal therapy may be appropriate when the pubertal delay is severe or the patient's psychosocial concerns about the delay play a prominent role that cannot be addressed by reassurance and education alone. (See <a class="local">'Patients with presumed constitutional delay of growth and puberty'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Tanner JM, Davies PS.
