In the United States alone, up to 40 million people run regularly, with more than 10 million running at least 100 days per year [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Although running is an effective way to achieve many health benefits, it is associated with a high risk of injury; yearly, up to one-half of runners report an injury [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Although some injuries are traumatic, most are due to overuse.</p><p>Given the popularity of running and the high rate of associated overuse injuries amenable to nonsurgical management, the primary care clinician is likely to manage many injured runners and should be familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of common problems. Evaluation of the injured runner and descriptions of common injuries and conditions sustained by runners are discussed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, and methods for preventing running-related injuries are reviewed separately.

class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examination of the injured runner includes assessment of not only the injured area but of all related structures (ie, the runner's entire "kinetic chain"), noting any imbalances or deficits in structure (eg, leg length discrepancy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113571" href="/z/d/graphic/113571.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>)), strength, flexibility, or motion  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113555" href="/z/d/graphic/113555.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Discrepancies may exist between legs or between muscle groups of the same leg (eg, hamstrings disproportionately stronger than quadriceps). One way to organize each element (eg, observation, strength testing) of the physical examination is to begin with proximal structures (eg, spine and pelvis) and work distally.</p><p>Careful observation of the patient's walking and running gaits helps to confirm that the anatomic problems identified during a stationary examination affect biomechanical performance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113980.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of walking and running gait"</a>.)</p><p>Begin your assessment by asking the injured runner to stand in front of you, noting their posture and lower extremity alignment. Observe the legs from hip to foot, looking for symmetry. Ask the patient to stand on one foot and then the other, watching for balance, control, and posture. Does the unsupported hip sag (ie, positive Trendelenburg test)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102338" href="/z/d/graphic/102338.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114764" href="/z/d/graphic/114764.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>)? A positive Trendelenburg test suggests weakness of the gluteus medius, a common finding in runners with hip and knee pain.</p><p>Note the structure of the knee, especially genu varus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114902" href="/z/d/graphic/114902.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) (which may be associated with iliotibial band syndrome or medial meniscal pathology) or valgus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114969" href="/z/d/graphic/114969.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>) (often seen in females with patellofemoral pain). Note the position of the patella and any apparent muscular asymmetry.</p><p>Make note of foot structure and position. Does the runner have a normal, high  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82600" href="/z/d/graphic/82600.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>), or flat longitudinal arch  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77874" href="/z/d/graphic/77874.html" rel="external">picture 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98818" href="/z/d/graphic/98818.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>)? Note the position of the calcaneus. Does the runner have calcaneal valgus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102233" href="/z/d/graphic/102233.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>) or varus? Does the runner have splaying  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96821" href="/z/d/graphic/96821.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>), hammering  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102225" href="/z/d/graphic/102225.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>), or other toe abnormalities? Ask the patient to walk and to squat. Watch for a limp, stiffness of one limb, and a tendency to shift weight off one limb.</p><p>Screen for tenderness and altered mobility of the spine, pelvis (including sacroiliac joints), hips, knees, ankles, and feet before turning your attention to the area of complaint. Be sure to assess muscle strength and neurovascular status throughout the lower extremity. Weakness of the hip musculature (particularly hip abductors) is common among novice runners, frequently contributing to lower extremity pain, especially patellofemoral pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/204.html" rel="external">"Patellofemoral pain"</a>.)</p><p>The following findings – moving distally from lumbar spine to foot – may be noted during the examination:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower back and abdomen</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Increased lumbar lordosis suggests weak anterior core muscles, a common condition in runners with hip weakness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Loss of normal lumbar lordosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114677" href="/z/d/graphic/114677.html" rel="external">picture 12</a>) (with or without back pain) is often present with tight hamstrings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hip and groin</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hip flexion, rotation, or abduction weakness is present with many lower extremity injuries, particularly those affecting the hip or knee.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Loss of internal rotation of the hip  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98467" href="/z/d/graphic/98467.html" rel="external">picture 13</a>) occurs with femoral neck stress fracture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pain and/or a sense of "catching" in the groin with the knee flexed to 90 degrees suggests a labral tear but also may be seen with iliopsoas tendinopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thigh and knee</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Leg length inequality  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113571" href="/z/d/graphic/113571.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) may be present with stress fractures and possibly with iliotibial band syndrome and lower back and pelvic injuries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Vastus medialis atrophy or asymmetry can occur with patellofemoral pain or in athletes who have had knee surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Asymmetry of the quadriceps muscles is common in runners with osteoarthritis of the hip.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower leg</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tenderness along the medial tibial border bilaterally is often present with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), or "shin splints."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Localized tenderness along the tibial border and a positive hop test suggest a tibial stress fracture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Foot and ankle</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Achilles tendon thickening or nodules suggests Achilles tendinopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tenderness at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76161" href="/z/d/graphic/76161.html" rel="external">picture 14</a>) suggests plantar fasciitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hallux limitus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102220" href="/z/d/graphic/102220.html" rel="external">picture 15</a>) or hallux rigidus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98856" href="/z/d/graphic/98856.html" rel="external">picture 16</a>) and reduced ankle dorsiflexion can develop with plantar fasciitis or calf muscle injuries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Splayed toe sign  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96821" href="/z/d/graphic/96821.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>) and forefoot widening can occur with metatarsalgia.</p><p></p><p>Diagnostic imaging, including plain radiographs, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and bone scan may be necessary in some cases to make a definitive diagnosis. However, the clinician should have a clear differential diagnosis in mind before ordering such studies.</p><p>Once a diagnosis is made and a treatment plan established, the clinician and athlete should work together to uncover and eliminate potential contributing factors, as many running injuries appear to be multifactorial. The mainstay of treatment for the vast majority of running injuries is "relative rest," which means stopping running (or, at a minimum, significantly reducing mileage) while the injury heals. Depending upon the injury, most runners can maintain reasonable conditioning by performing non-impact exercises in a pool or on a bike or by using other equipment (eg, rowing machine).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2940007188"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC INJURIES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H548337534"><span class="h2">Hip injuries</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3070758598"><span class="h3">Overview and approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hip injuries are less common in runners than injuries to the lower extremity, and they can be difficult to diagnose. Nevertheless, during jogging, the hip joint is subjected to loads up to eight times body weight, and both acute and chronic injuries can occur [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In runners, the differential diagnosis of hip pain includes gluteus medius tendinopathy, piriformis syndrome, stress fracture of the femoral neck, labral tear, and, less often, radicular pain from the lumbar spine. Better understanding of the functional anatomy of the hip suggests a correlation between hip muscle weakness and injury to the low back or lower extremity in athletes, including runners [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1926754311"><span class="h3">Gluteus medius weakness and tendinopathy and piriformis syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The gluteus medius originates along the external surface of the ilium and runs distally and laterally to its attachment on the greater trochanter of the femur  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53747" href="/z/d/graphic/53747.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The gluteus medius abducts the hip and assists with pelvic stability during running. Weakness of the muscle typically causes pain with hip abduction and rotation. Pain generally increases when the muscle is stretched, and there may be focal tenderness at the muscle's insertion, just medial and superior to the greater trochanter. Difficulty maintaining a level pelvis while standing on one leg (positive Trendelenburg sign) may be noted  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102338" href="/z/d/graphic/102338.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The piriformis muscle is a small but important external rotator of the hip that crosses the sciatic nerve and is believed by some to cause sciatica-type pain when it compresses the nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120265" href="/z/d/graphic/120265.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. However, the existence of this so-called "piriformis syndrome" remains controversial, and diagnosis is difficult [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. Piriformis syndrome in the runner may be associated with foot overpronation, weakness of the gluteal muscles and other hip abductors, and tightness of the hip adductors.</p><p>The mainstay of treatment for both gluteus medius tendinopathy and piriformis syndrome is physical therapy and correction of biomechanical abnormalities. Orthotics and massage therapy may be useful; <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be used for analgesia.

It is thought to be largely avascular. Although the labrum's function is not fully understood, it is thought to provide stability and decrease the stress placed on the hip joint. Therefore, a significant tear in the labrum can increase stress on the hip joint, decrease stability, and ultimately lead to damage of the articular cartilage.</p><p>Labral tears are reported in sports that require frequent hip rotation, such as soccer and hockey, and in runners, especially female runners. Runners with a labral tear typically complain of pain in the anterior hip or groin. They may have mechanical symptoms, including clicking, locking, catching, or giving way (so-called "snapping hip"). Other hip injuries that may produce such mechanical symptoms include iliopsoas tendinopathy.</p><p>Labral tears are complex and often frustrating to treat. Physical therapy has mixed results.

Although the history may be similar, a focal, palpable area of tenderness is present in most patients with stress fractures, whereas tenderness is much more diffuse and there are no discrete palpable lesions in those with MTSS. Imaging may be necessary in some cases to rule out a stress fracture. Plain radiographs are normal in patients with shin splints but may also be unrevealing early in the course of a stress fracture.

The etiology of plantar fasciitis remains unclear, but the condition is often attributed to training errors, biomechanical problems, and excessive foot pronation or supination, and it is more common in older and heavier runners [<a href="#rid30">30-32</a>]. The biomechanical abnormality most often associated with plantar fasciitis is decreased dorsiflexion of the foot and toes, and thus, stretching is an important part of treatment.

However, some runners may present with vague lateral forefoot pain. This presentation is likely due to runners shifting their body weight to the lateral foot during the foot-strike phase of running to reduce the load on the great toe. It remains unclear whether running is a cause of hallux rigidus or aggravates symptoms elicited by other factors. Shoes with a toe box that is too small or pointed may contribute.</p><p>Hallux valgus (ie, bunion) deformity is defined as a lateral deviation of the hallux (great toe) on the first metatarsal  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96788" href="/z/d/graphic/96788.html" rel="external">picture 26</a>).

A metatarsal pad placed proximal to the area of tenderness often relieves symptoms; in more severe cases, a custom orthotic may be needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3467452421"><span class="h3">Morton neuroma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Interdigital neuromas (often referred to as Morton neuroma) are thought to be due to swelling and scar tissue formation on the small interdigital nerves. They most commonly involve the third interdigital space. An intermetatarsal bursitis can cause a similar pain. Morton neuroma is reviewed in detail separately; aspects of particular importance for runners are discussed below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113052.html" rel="external">"Evaluation, diagnosis, and select management of common causes of forefoot pain in adults", section on 'Interdigital (Morton) neuroma'</a>.)</p><p>The runner with a neuroma may complain of numbness of the involved toes or pain that increases with activity and is usually felt between the third and fourth toes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65666" href="/z/d/graphic/65666.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). Examination may reveal a clicking sensation (Mulder sign) when palpating this interspace while simultaneously squeezing the metatarsal joints. Overpronation and tight shoes are often associated with the condition.</p><p>Ultrasound offers an inexpensive option for identifying Morton neuroma with accuracy comparable to MRI and can help to distinguish a neuroma from intra-metatarsal bursal swelling or synovitis in<em> </em>adjacent joints.</p><p>Conservative treatment should precede expensive diagnostic procedures. This approach involves decreasing pressure on the metatarsal heads by using a metatarsal support or bar or padded shoe insert. Strength exercises for the intrinsic foot muscles are often part of conservative treatment. Treatment inserts are often placed in both shoes (even when symptoms are unilateral) to ensure that the patient walks evenly, but bilateral pads are not always needed. A broad-toed shoe that allows spreading of the metatarsal heads may be helpful. Invasive therapies may be needed should conservative measures fail. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113052.html" rel="external">"Evaluation, diagnosis, and select management of common causes of forefoot pain in adults", section on 'Interdigital (Morton) neuroma'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3276817748"><span class="h3">Tarsal tunnel syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) is an uncommon source of foot pain in runners due to entrapment of the posterior tibial nerve or one of its branches as it courses behind the medial malleolus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50910" href="/z/d/graphic/50910.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). The most common causes include an acute injury and its sequelae (eg, scar tissue) or repetitive microtrauma, as occurs with running, particularly in runners who overpronate. Runners with TTS complain of numbness or burning pain, usually along the plantar surface of the foot, although complaints may be localized to the medial plantar surface of the heel, mimicking plantar fasciitis. TTS typically worsens with running or at night. Findings are almost always sensory; muscle weakness is uncommon. A positive Tinel sign may be present. As in carpal tunnel syndrome, a positive sign occurs when symptoms are elicited by tapping over the path of the nerve. TTS is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5278.html" rel="external">"Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes", section on 'Tarsal tunnel syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4084862870"><span class="h3">Toenail injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Athletes in many sports sustain toenail injuries from repetitive trauma to the nail or nail bed. In runners, this condition is commonly called "jogger's toenail," and it most frequently affects the great toe  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107143" href="/z/d/graphic/107143.html" rel="external">picture 27</a>) [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. The nail may turn black (due to subungual bleeding) or fall off, especially after a long-distance run such as a marathon. The differential diagnosis for these injuries includes fungal infection and subungual melanoma. The management of acute subungual hematoma, fungal infection of the nail (onychomycosis), and melanoma are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6335.html" rel="external">"Subungual hematoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4034.html" rel="external">"Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>In the author’s experience, toenail injuries in runners are most often due to poorly fitting shoes. Thus, injuries can be prevented by using properly fitted running shoes. Such shoes provide sufficient space in the toe box and are sized to accommodate the longest toe. The midfoot portion of the shoe should fit properly and be sufficiently snug to prevent the toes from slipping forward and striking against the end of the toe box.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H153893323"><span class="h3">Friction blisters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Friction blisters are caused by continual rubbing or pressure on the skin and are common among runners. They affect runners of all levels of experience, from novices to professionals, and all distances, from sprinters to ultramarathon competitors. In a study of 204 amateur runners over the age of 18, blisters were self-reported as one of the three most frequent injuries (along with sprains and abrasions) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Blisters develop most often on the toes, ball of the foot, and heel  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118749" href="/z/d/graphic/118749.html" rel="external">picture 28</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112564.html" rel="external">"Friction blisters"</a>.)</p><p>Runners and clinicians have used various interventions to prevent blisters, with varying results reported. In our clinical experience, the following interventions are helpful:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wear properly fitting running shoes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16321.html" rel="external">"Running injuries of the lower extremities: Risk factors and prevention", section on 'Running shoe design'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wear properly fitting socks made from materials that reduce friction and wick moisture from the skin. Make sure the portion of the sock between the shoe and the skin is wrinkle free.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At areas known to be susceptible to blisters ("hot spots") in particular runners, apply a viscous lubricant or a protective bandage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For lubricants, the authors have found SkinLube and Blisterblock to be useful products. We have found Vaseline to be less effective. For protective bandages, we have found Blisterderm and Moleskin to be helpful.</p><p></p><p>Several randomized trials of paper tape for blister prevention were performed during RaceThePlanet ultramarathons (250-km [155-mile] race) in 2010 to 2011 and again in 2014. During the first trial, all 136 runner participants developed blisters during the race and reported that paper tape was not protective [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. In a subsequent trial involving 128 race participants, the authors reported that paper tape reduced blisters by 40 percent [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. In an observational study of ultra-distance runners, no prophylactic measures, including taping, application of talcum powder and antiperspirants, and different types of socks, reduced blister rates [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. In this study, the only factor associated with a reduction in blisters was prior ultra-distance race experience [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. A study from 1990 reported that acrylic fiber socks were associated with fewer and smaller blisters, but a 1993 follow-up study clarified that acrylic socks were only superior when they were knitted in such a way as to provide "anatomical padding" [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>].</p><p>If a friction blister has formed, it should not be unroofed in most cases. However, large, fluid-filled blisters in problematic locations may be drained in sterile fashion and covered with a clean bandage. Runners generally do not need to wait until a blister has completely healed before resuming running, but it makes sense to perform alternative exercises (eg, cycling, swimming) that do not aggravate the affected area for a few days while the blister is allowed to heal. Proper technique for draining a friction blister is described separately.
