(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p>The ingestion of NSAIDs can give rise to several allergic and "pseudoallergic" reactions, which develop within minutes to hours of administration. Allergic reactions are abnormal immunologic reactions to NSAIDs, while pseudoallergic reactions are nonimmunologic reactions that are believed to result from acquired alterations in the biochemical pathways upon which NSAIDs act.</p><p>The prevalence of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs in the general population is not known. These reactions occur sporadically in both children and adults. Symptoms include rhinoconjunctivitis, bronchospasm, urticaria/angioedema, and anaphylaxis.</p><p>In addition to allergic reactions, there are various types of idiosyncratic adverse reactions to NSAIDs that are presumed or known to involve other types of immune mechanisms. These include, but are not limited to, aseptic meningitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, interstitial nephritis, erythema multiforme, fixed drug eruptions, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema nodosum, maculopapular eruptions, and bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These types of reactions are discussed in various topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2089.html" rel="external">"Drug eruptions"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2091.html" rel="external">"Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions caused by NSAIDs will be reviewed here. The challenge protocols used by allergy specialists to evaluate and manage affected patients are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2085.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic challenge and desensitization protocols for NSAID reactions"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION OF NSAIDs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes (also known as prostaglandin H synthases). There are two known COX isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>COX-1 is expressed constitutively in all human cell types and is involved in protective physiologic functions, such as gastric mucosal protection. Inhibition of COX-1 impairs these protective functions and is generally undesirable. As an example, COX-1 inhibition by NSAIDs results in diminished production of the protective compound prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> in the gastric mucosa, leading to gastritis in susceptible patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>COX-2 is an inducible enzyme expressed in many inflammatory cells in the presence of appropriate stimuli. COX-2 mediates the generation of the same range of prostaglandins as COX-1 but only at sites of inflammation. Thus, COX-2 inhibition is largely responsible for the desired antiinflammatory effects of NSAIDs.</p><p></p><p>The various NSAIDs inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 to different degrees. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> is a strong inhibitor of COX-1. In this topic, NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 are said to be "cross-reactive" with aspirin  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62880" href="/d/graphic/62880.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). NSAIDs that inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 are called "nonselective," while those that predominantly inhibit COX-2 are called "COX-2 selective." Within the group of selective NSAIDs are those that are weakly selective for COX-2 but also inhibit COX-1, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9671" href="/d/drug information/9671.html" rel="external">nabumetone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10295" href="/d/drug information/10295.html" rel="external">meloxicam</a>, and nimesulide (not available in the United States). Other agents are considered highly selective for COX-2, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">celecoxib</a>.</p><p>The mechanism of action of NSAIDs and the different types of agents available are reviewed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">"Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION OF REACTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NSAID reactions can be categorized as either pseudoallergic or allergic. Pseudoallergic reactions are induced by multiple different NSAIDs, while allergic reactions are usually induced by a single NSAID or a small number of structurally similar agents:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pseudoallergic NSAID reactions</strong> – Pseudoallergic reactions are nonimmunologic reactions that are related to the cyclooxygenase (COX) 1-inhibiting properties of the drug.

Pseudoallergic reactions are usually seen in patients with one of the following comorbidities: the combination of asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis or chronic urticaria.</p><p>Pseudoallergic reactions can be divided into four types  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type 1 – NSAID-induced asthma and rhinosinusitis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type 2 – NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema in patients with chronic urticaria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type 3 – NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type 4 – Blended (mixed respiratory and/or cutaneous) reactions in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Type 1: NSAID-induced asthma and rhinosinusitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NSAID ingestion precipitates a constellation of nasoocular and/or lower respiratory symptoms in some patients with concomitant asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (often with nasal polyposis). These include one or more of the following: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, periorbital edema and/or injection of the conjunctiva, bronchospasm, and/or laryngospasm. Some patients can experience hives and/or angioedema in addition to the respiratory tract symptoms. A few patients with severe respiratory reactions have accompanying extra respiratory tract symptoms, such as flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hypotension. These reactions are termed "type 1 pseudoallergic reactions." Type 1 reactions typically begin one to three hours after administration.</p><p>Patients with the combination of NSAID pseudoallergy, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis are said to have aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Another term for this disorder is NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD). AERD and the diagnosis of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> pseudoallergy are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/520.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15539.html" rel="external">"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: NSAID challenge and desensitization"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Type 2: NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema in patients with chronic urticaria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a history of chronic urticaria can develop an exacerbation of their hives, sometimes with angioedema, beginning 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The exacerbating effects of NSAIDs may be noticeable in up to 30 percent of patients with stable chronic urticaria, and higher rates of NSAID sensitivity are typical in patients with active urticaria [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. These reactions are usually dose dependent.</p><p>Avoidance of COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs can be helpful in minimizing acute flares in chronic urticaria, although it does not appear to alter the long-term course of the condition [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Pharmacotherapy of patients with chronic urticaria is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8106.html" rel="external">"Chronic spontaneous urticaria: Standard management and patient education"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Type 3: NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In this form of pseudoallergy, children and adults <strong>without</strong> underlying chronic urticaria develop acute urticaria and/or angioedema 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion of COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs. Isolated angioedema following NSAID ingestion typically involves the facial areas, particularly the periorbital skin, lips, and mouth. These patients may develop urticaria and/or angioedema only after NSAID ingestion or may have intermittent episodes of unexplained urticaria unrelated to NSAID ingestion, but they do not have underlying chronic urticaria (ie, recurrent episodes of urticaria/angioedema persisting for six weeks or longer). It is not known whether these patients subsequently develop chronic urticaria more frequently than the general population.</p><p>The probable mechanism is related to COX-1 inhibition, as patients with type 3 pseudoallergy can react to their very first dose of a COX-1 inhibitor and to structurally different COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs. In addition, such patients usually tolerate highly selective COX-2-inhibiting NSAIDs (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">celecoxib</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Type 4: Blended reactions in otherwise asymptomatic individuals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Occasionally, reactions to NSAIDs/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> do not fit into the above three reaction types. Some patients with underlying AERD develop cutaneous symptoms as well as respiratory symptoms in response to NSAIDs and are included in this group. Patients without apparent underlying conditions may develop combinations of symptoms affecting both the respiratory tract and skin, including bronchospasm, rhinitis, urticaria, and/or angioedema after ingestion of different COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs. These reactions are usually triggered by multiple COX-1-inhibiting NSAIDs and may represent a combination of mechanisms. Until they are better characterized, these reactions have been classified as a separate type.</p><p>The time course of type 4 reactions is variable. The author has observed the following patterns: Reactions that are purely cutaneous usually appear within 30 minutes, while patients with AERD with cutaneous symptoms as part of respiratory reactions show a delay identical to patients with type 1 reactions (with an average delay after administration of approximately 90 minutes). Patients with both cutaneous and respiratory reactions, but without underlying AERD, typically react at approximately 60 minutes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">ALLERGIC REACTIONS (PRESUMED IgE-MEDIATED)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergic reactions to NSAIDs range from urticaria/angioedema to life-threatening anaphylaxis. In contrast to pseudoallergic reactions, these reactions are elicited by a single NSAID or, rarely, by more than one agent with similar molecular structures. Patients with allergic reactions to an NSAID have had at least one prior exposure to the culprit drug, which presumedly sensitizes them and results in symptoms upon repeat exposure to the same drug [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>These reactions are believed to be immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated, and the allergen is thought to be a drug metabolite bound to a carrier protein. In the United States, most of these reactions have been associated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>, the first NSAID to become available over the counter, although they can happen with any NSAID. There has been one case report of aspirin-induced angioedema with measurable specific IgE to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>/human serum albumin complex [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, the generalizability of this finding is unknown, and there are no practical or commercially available tests to detect IgE to NSAIDs (such as skin testing or drug-specific serum IgE tests).</p><p>Allergic reactions may be divided into two types, based solely upon the severity of the symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304" href="/d/graphic/90304.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The underlying mechanism is believed to be the same. It is possible that most patients with type 5 reactions would progress to anaphylaxis (type 6) if they took the same NSAID repeatedly. Thus, some experts consider types 5 and 6 to be different severities of the same type of reaction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Type 5: Urticaria/angioedema to a single NSAID</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with type 5 reactions typically develop urticaria and/or angioedema within minutes to one hour of taking a particular NSAID [<a href="#rid9">9,13</a>]. Affected individuals generally do not have underlying chronic urticaria.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Type 6: Anaphylaxis to a single NSAID (not aspirin)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Type 6 reactions are distinguished from type 5 reactions based only upon severity. Patients with anaphylaxis have usually experienced urticarial reactions to the culprit NSAID in the past but did not realize the association and continued to reexpose themselves to the drug. Typical symptoms of anaphylaxis include shortness of breath/wheezing due to bronchospasm or laryngeal edema and hypotension due to vascular collapse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/392.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Anaphylaxis has been reported with various NSAIDs, including most of the cyclooxygenase (COX) 1-inhibiting agents [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>], as well as from <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">celecoxib</a> (a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor) [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">Ibuprofen</a> is the NSAID most commonly implicated in severe anaphylaxis in the United States, whereas <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">diclofenac</a> is more common in France, and the pyrazole NSAIDs (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, azapropazone) are commonly implicated in Spain [<a href="#rid10">10,20</a>]. It is notable that there are no confirmed cases of anaphylaxis to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> itself. This is one reason that aspirin is used in challenge procedures. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic strategy'</a> below.)</p><p>There are also reports of anaphylaxis due to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol) [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. This agent is an antipyretic and pain reliever, rather than an antiinflammatory.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NSAID reactions range from mild to life threatening and are challenging to diagnose because some of the signs and symptoms of minor and severe reactions are similar. The presumptive diagnosis of an allergic or pseudoallergic reaction to an NSAID is based upon the historical details of the reaction. In some situations, an <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> challenge procedure can be performed to assess specificity. However, challenges should be done by clinicians trained in performing them. There are no validated in vitro or skin testing methods available.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Certain critical pieces of information should be obtained from the history, if possible:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is the reaction elicited by one NSAID or multiple NSAIDs? It is important to discern if the patient took any other cyclooxygenase (COX) 1-inhibiting NSAIDs <strong>subsequent to</strong> the first recognized reaction. If so, did this drug also cause a reaction? If other NSAIDs also caused symptoms, then the patient has pseudoallergic reaction. In contrast, NSAIDs that were ingested without problems <strong>before</strong> the first reaction are not relevant, because reactions to NSAIDs are nearly always acquired (rather than present from birth).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there underlying asthma/rhinosinusitis/nasal polyposis (ie, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [AERD]) or chronic idiopathic urticaria? Any recurrent symptoms of asthma or sinus problems or previous episodes of urticaria should be explored to discern if one of these conditions may be present but undiagnosed. These chronic conditions usually develop before the NSAID reaction, with rare exceptions.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H262516220"><span class="h2">Testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For types 1 to 4 NSAID reactions, there are no validated in vitro or skin testing methods available. However, there may be exceptions for some type 5 and 6 reactions.
