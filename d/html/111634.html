Regurgitation associated with prosthetic heart valves includes regurgitation through the valve (transvalvular) as well as paravalvular regurgitation (also known as paravalvular leak). Symptomatic severe prosthetic valve regurgitation is an uncommon complication of surgical valve replacement. However, it is associated with poor outcomes with both conservative management and surgical treatment.</p><p>This topic will discuss clinical manifestations and diagnosis of surgical prosthetic aortic and mitral valve regurgitation. Transcatheter heart valve regurgitation and prognosis and management of surgical prosthetic valve regurgitation are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110074.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112653.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of surgical aortic and mitral prosthetic valve regurgitation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2504613584"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS AND PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Normally functioning mechanical valves and some normally functioning bioprosthetic valves have trivial to mild transvalvular regurgitation, which should be distinguished from pathological regurgitation. On color Doppler echocardiographic imaging of normally functioning mechanical prosthetic valves, two types of retrograde jets are seen: a closing volume caused by motion of the occluder and true trivial or mild regurgitation at the edges of the occluder. Mechanical prosthetic valves are designed to cause trivial to mild transvalvular regurgitation when functioning normally as a safety mechanism known as leakage backflow or washing jets; this mechanism is thought to reduce the risk of valve thrombosis. Trivial regurgitation is also normal for some types of bioprosthetic valves (particularly stentless valves), due to minimal leaflet retraction once placed.</p><p>The principal types of pathologic prosthetic valve regurgitation are transvalvular regurgitation (due to structural valve deterioration [SVD] or non-structural valve dysfunction) and paravalvular leakage:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transvalvular regurgitation</strong> − Pathologic transvalvular regurgitation is much more common with bioprosthetic valves compared with mechanical valves. With conventional stented bioprostheses, 10 to 30 percent had significant SVD at 10 years, and 20 to 50 percent at 15 years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, SVD includes both regurgitation and stenosis, and the prevalence of patients with regurgitation is unknown. The rate of structural failure decreases with age, probably in part due to less activity in older patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As an additional example, 2659 patients receiving 2758 Carpentier-Edwards aortic valve bioprosthesis (98 required a second bioprosthesis and one required a third) were prospectively followed using clinical and echocardiographic criteria [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>SVD was defined as development of severe aortic stenosis or severe aortic regurgitation (AR). The number of patients with severe AR was not reported. SVD was reported in 157 patients (123 of whom required reintervention) over a cumulative follow-up of 18,404 valve-years. All cases of SVD were late events, and actuarial freedom from SVD at 15 and 20 years was 78.6 and 48.5 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Freedom from reoperation for SVD at 15 years was 70.8 percent for patients aged 60 years or less, 82.7 percent for those 60 to 70 years, and 98.1 percent for those over 70 years old.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Paravalvular leak</strong> − The incidence of prosthetic paravalvular leak varies widely among registries. However, they are more commonly detected in mechanic valves and in the mitral position. Mitral paravalvular leak can be seen in 7 to 17 percent of implanted valves, while aortic paravalvular leaks occur in 2 to 10 percent of implanted valves [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H598376316"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2045238334"><span class="h2">Symptoms and signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical presentation of prosthetic valve regurgitation varies depending upon its severity, its hemodynamic effects, and its cause (eg, valve thrombus or vegetations). In asymptomatic patients, prosthetic valve regurgitation may be detected as an incidental finding obtained on routine follow-up, while symptomatic patients frequently present with marked symptoms of overt heart failure (HF). (See <a class="local">'Identifying the cause of prosthetic valve regurgitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Many cases of prosthetic valve regurgitation present as an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient, as most patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation have a normally functioning valve with trivial to mild regurgitation and a benign course without symptoms. However, significant regurgitation can lead to serious clinical consequences and adverse outcomes.</p><p>Among patients with paravalvular leak, the rate of symptomatic regurgitation varies among series between 1 to 5 percent [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. The rate of symptomatic transvalvular regurgitation is difficult to estimate, as reported structural valve deterioration (SVD) includes both stenotic and regurgitant deterioration, as has been previously discussed. When symptomatic, patients present with HF in more than 90 percent of cases, with an average New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class &gt;III [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>].</p><p>A change in auscultatory findings, such as a change in prosthetic valve sounds or the appearance of a new murmur, should prompt suspicion of prosthetic valve dysfunction, although such findings have low specificity [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Some cases of prosthetic regurgitation caused by valve thrombosis or vegetations are associated with embolic events. Other clinical manifestations of infection, such as fever, are commonly present in patients with endocarditis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8121.html" rel="external">"Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2138.html" rel="external">"Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H581797112"><span class="h2">Blood tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood tests are not indicated to diagnose prosthetic valve regurgitation. However, abnormal test results (eg, signs of hemolysis) may trigger evaluation of a prosthetic valve.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Detection of hemolysis</strong> − Patients with prosthetic valves who develop significant hemolysis should undergo prosthetic valve evaluation to assess for paravalvular leak (PVL) or transvalvular regurgitation. On the other hand, hemolysis screening should be performed whenever significant (more than mild) regurgitation is detected. Patients with prosthetic valves commonly have hemolysis caused by shear stress across the prosthesis, more commonly with mechanical valves than with bioprosthetic valves [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, rarely is hemolysis severe enough to cause anemia with new generation normal functioning prosthetic valves (&lt;1 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Since significant hemolytic anemia is strongly associated with SVD or the appearance of PVL, pathological regurgitation should be suspected if significant hemolysis occurs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8134.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of patients with prosthetic heart valves", section on 'Hemolytic anemia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7168.html" rel="external">"Non-immune (Coombs-negative) hemolytic anemias in adults", section on 'Intravascular devices'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Typical findings of hemolysis include elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, anemia (reduced hemoglobin level), depressed serum haptoglobin level (eg, ≤25 mg/dL), and an elevated reticulocyte count (&gt;2 percent). Although there are no standard criteria for quantifying prosthetic-related hemolytic anemia, it is considered severe when it results in symptomatic hemolysis, refractory anemia, high levels of urinary iron, or need for frequent red blood cell transfusions [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Natriuretic peptide levels</strong> − In patients presenting with HF, natriuretic levels are expected to be elevated (eg, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide &gt;400 pg/mL; brain natriuretic peptide &gt;100 pg/mL). Natriuretic levels are not required to diagnose HF, but may be helpful if the diagnosis of HF is uncertain, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3486.html" rel="external">"Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">"Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Natriuretic peptide'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2980335648"><span class="h2">Chest radiograph</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chest radiograph is not indicated to diagnose prosthetic valve regurgitation but may be obtained as part of the evaluation of HF or dyspnea of unknown cause. There are no specific radiologic signs of prosthetic regurgitation, but signs of HF may be present.

Patients with prosthetic heart valves should undergo routine follow-up, which is discussed separately, for early detection of any complication.

The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) valve guidelines note that often both TTE and TEE are required to determine the cause and severity of prosthetic valve regurgitation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1526679141"><span class="h3">Aortic transvalvular regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prosthetic transvalvular aortic regurgitation (AR) is generally well visualized from multiple views by TTE since the effects of prosthetic acoustic shadowing are usually limited. TTE is often adequate to identify and quantify AR severity. The severity of prosthetic transvalvular AR is graded using the same principles used for quantitation of native AR [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>], although limited data are available on the validation of the established parameters in the context of prosthetic regurgitation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The following parameters are used to semiquantitatively assess prosthetic AR:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Valve structure and motion</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Left ventricular (LV) size</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Jet width (vena contracta), particularly for central jets</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Jet density</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Jet deceleration rate</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta</p><p></p><p>As an example, the jet width is compared to the LV outflow tract diameter: ≤25 percent suggests mild AR, and ≥65 percent suggests severe. However, the jet width method has a lower accuracy for eccentric jets. The accuracy of 3D vena contracta and estimated regurgitant orifice area are limited in the setting of multiple jets and those with great radial extension [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5295.html" rel="external">"Echocardiographic evaluation of the aortic valve", section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5333.html" rel="external">"Echocardiographic evaluation of prosthetic heart valves", section on 'Prosthetic aortic regurgitation'</a>.)</p><p>In the evaluation of prosthetic aortic transvalvular regurgitation, TEE is recommended when TTE results are suboptimal or inconclusive and is particularly helpful for assessing causes of regurgitation such as endocarditis (with vegetations and/or abscess formation), thrombus, other masses, and dehiscence (a cause of paravalvular leak) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H789254095"><span class="h3">Paravalvular AR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Paravalvular AR is often well visualized from multiple views by TTE since the effects of prosthetic acoustic shadowing are limited [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Thus, TTE may be adequate to identify and quantify paravalvular AR severity. The severity of paravalvular AR is defined using the parameters and methods described above for transvalvular AR [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, paravalvular AR jets are frequently eccentric, and jet width is less accurate for eccentric jets. In 2018, a five-class grading scheme was proposed by the Valve Academic Research Consortium, which was later adapted by the PVL Research Consortium [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].

Thus, color Doppler imaging of a mitral prosthetic regurgitant jet is generally suboptimal. Similarly, paravalvular mitral regurgitation (MR) is generally not well visualized by TTE, as the jets are usually eccentric, thin, and adjacent to the ring.

The maximal width of the vena contracta is a particularly helpful parameter in assessment of paravalvular MR [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The PISA has not been validated as a quantitative tool to estimate the severity of paravalvular MR, although a large PISA shell is consistently related with more severe regurgitation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The use of quantitative Doppler methods to measure regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction is not generally recommended, since this method has not been validated for paravalvular regurgitation [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Systolic flow reversal in the pulmonary veins can be useful, as it is a specific (but not sensitive) sign of severe MR [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

As discussed separately, confirmation is based upon a combination of clinical, microbiological, and imaging criteria. TTE imaging of prosthetic valves is frequently suboptimal; TEE is generally indicated to identify prosthetic valve vegetations and identify complications such as paravalvular abscess or fistula.

However, pannus growth differs from thrombus in being unrelated to the intensity of anticoagulation.

However, TTE color Doppler assessment of regurgitant jets (particularly with mitral prostheses) is often limited by the presence of acoustic artifacts generated by the prosthesis, which can mask the severity of the regurgitation. The role of TTE in assessing prosthetic regurgitation varies depending upon the valve site and type of regurgitation, as described above.

These artifacts are magnified in cine images, degrading the quality significantly. However, CMR is able to perform accurate flow-imaging and volume-based measurements, which is especially relevant in patients with multiple jets, whose evaluation with TEE is complex [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].
