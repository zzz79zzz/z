At these visits, patients are evaluated with a history, physical examination, blood work, and imaging studies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4749.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma", section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Progressive disease (PD) can present with systemic B symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, weight loss), cytopenias, development of an extranodal mass, or as symptomatic or asymptomatic enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. By definition, PD reflects the appearance of any new lesion, an increase in previously identified lesion(s), or new/recurrent involvement of the bone marrow (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97480" href="/z/d/graphic/97480.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>When relapse is suspected, we suggest a biopsy of the involved lymph node or mass to confirm relapse (eg, to exclude an inflammatory process) and evaluate for a potential change in histology (eg, development of a B cell lymphoma). Once relapse is confirmed, the patient should undergo a staging evaluation with a physical examination, and imaging studies (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479" href="/z/d/graphic/97479.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Bone marrow biopsy is not required unless otherwise clinically indicated (eg, unexplained cytopenias).

A meta-analysis reported 37 percent five-year overall survival (OS) among patients with PTCL treated with standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. There is a paucity of data regarding outcomes for patients treated for relapsed or refractory disease but, based on retrospective analyses and small prospective trials, long-term survival in the absence of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is generally poor [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]. As an example, a population-based study reported median OS and progression-free survival (PFS) of six and three months, respectively, among 153 adults with relapsed/refractory PTCL who did not undergo HCT [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Given that the optimal therapy for relapsed/refractory PTCL remains to be defined, we advocate participation in a clinical trial whenever possible. In the absence of an available clinical trial, we stratify patients by intent to proceed to HCT. For patients who are potential candidates for HCT, we favor salvage combination chemotherapy with the goal of achieving a response as a bridge to transplant. For patients who are not HCT candidates, we favor sequential single agents or newer agents.</p><p>As an important exception, we use brentuximab rather than traditional chemotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), even if the intent is to proceed to HCT. Palliation of symptoms is a reasonable goal for patients who fail to respond to second-line chemotherapy regimens or who relapse after transplant.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no standard therapy for patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL. As such, patients should be strongly encouraged to participate in a clinical trial. At present, no single chemotherapy regimen is clearly superior to others. Outside the context of a clinical trial, the selection of treatment should be based upon the goal of care, expected toxicities, patient comorbidities, and convenience.</p><p>For most patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL who are candidates for HCT, we treat with a traditional salvage combination chemotherapy regimen rather than a newer agent, because of higher response rates and the possibility of long-term survival following HCT in those who achieve a complete response (CR). However, we often treat with histone deacetylase inhibitors or other newer agents in the setting of primary refractory disease, early relapse (eg, within six months of initial therapy), subsequent relapses, or patients receiving treatment with non-curative intent. Patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL are treated with newer agents even if the intent is to proceed to transplant. </p><p>The largest case series investigating traditional chemotherapy regimens included 153 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS; 52 percent), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL; 25 percent), and ALCL, primary systemic type (ALCL; 23 percent) treated at the British Columbia Cancer Agency from 1976 to 2010 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients who underwent HCT were excluded. Management at first relapse consisted of combination or single agent chemotherapy (58 percent), supportive care alone (20 percent), irradiation (9 percent), corticosteroids (8 percent), and no treatment (4 percent). Median OS was 3.7 months for the group as a whole and 6.5 months for those who received chemotherapy. Rates of second PFS and OS at three years were 16 and 7 percent, respectively. Among the 78 patients treated after 2001, the median second PFS and OS after relapse were 4.6 and 6.7 months, respectively, and did not differ from the group as a whole. This experience confirms the poor prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. Since relapse is common and remissions are short, patients without significant comorbidities who have an available donor should proceed with HCT as soon as possible after attaining a response.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Traditional regimens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who are transplant candidates may respond to traditional regimens used for aggressive lymphoma such as:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ICE (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8552" href="/z/d/drug information/8552.html" rel="external">ifosfamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>DHAP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>, high dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/z/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">cytarabine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ESHAP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>, methyl-prednisolone, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/z/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">cytarabine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Single agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/z/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a> [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>GDP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/z/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/z/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">Gemcitabine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a> [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]</p><p></p><p>The Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12 trial randomly assigned 59 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL to salvage chemotherapy with DHAP or GDP [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

For the group as a whole, one-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS were 16 and 28 percent, respectively. For those patients with PTCL who later underwent autologous HCT, two-year EFS and OS were 21 and 42 percent, respectively. </p><p>Other published experience is limited to case reports of patients with PTCL and phase II trials in which patients with PTCL comprised only a minority of those with various aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. With these regimens, overall response rates for patients with PTCL are approximately 40 to 50 percent. Trials of various salvage regimens in aggressive lymphoma are discussed in more detail separately.

Other, newer agents are typically reserved for subsequent relapses or patients receiving treatment with non-curative intent. As an important exception, patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL are treated with newer agents even if the intent is to proceed to transplant. </p><p>Our choice among the newer agents is generally guided by the specific subtype of PTCL and the toxicity profiles of the agents.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with relapsed or refractory angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), we suggest use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96188" href="/z/d/drug information/96188.html" rel="external">belinostat</a> rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9530" href="/z/d/drug information/9530.html" rel="external">pralatrexate</a> or brentuximab.
