In addition to aggressive medical therapy, two pathways of NSTEACS treatment have emerged: the early invasive strategy and the early conservative strategy. In the early invasive strategy, the more common approach in the modern treatment of NSTEACS, patients with high-risk features and without contraindications undergo coronary angiography and revascularization as deemed appropriate. Alternatively, there is a smaller group of patients with NSTEACS, generally those with low-risk features or at higher risk of complications from invasive angiography, who can be treated with an early conservative approach. In such conservatively treated patients, an ischemia-guided management strategy, dictated by stress test findings, results in outcomes similar to the early invasive strategy.</p><p>The role of stress testing in pre- and early post-discharge risk stratification of patients with NSTEACS will be reviewed here. The comprehensive risk stratification of patients with NSTEACS, as well as the approach to treatment, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/76.html" rel="external">"Risk stratification after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/68.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/48.html" rel="external">"Overview of the nonacute management of unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2580928453"><span class="h1">WHO NEEDS A STRESS TEST AND WHEN SHOULD IT BE PERFORMED</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to the use of noninvasive stress testing following conservative treatment of patients with NSTEACS treated medically is consistent with the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for the management of patients with NSTEACS [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The primary role of stress testing is to distinguish between higher-risk subjects with severe and/or extensive ischemia who would have improved outcomes with revascularization, and lower-risk subjects with no or limited ischemia who would have comparable outcomes with medical therapy alone. Stress test findings also provide prognostic information, guide activity prescription, and assess the effectiveness of therapy. In subjects with extensive myocardial injury, stress testing may also provide information on the presence and extent of myocardial viability.</p><p>Patients with recent NSTEACS may safely undergo a stress test provided they have been asymptomatic and clinically stable at least 12 to 24 hours for those with unstable angina and two to five days for those with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The longer delay prior to stress testing (two to five days) may also be warranted in some patients with high-risk features such as advanced age, left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, and peripheral vascular disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/43.html" rel="external">"Acute coronary syndrome: Terminology and classification"</a>.)</p><p>Most patients who require a stress test post-NSTEACS will undergo the test prior to discharge. However, early post-discharge testing may be considered in lower-risk patients including those who have been revascularized (culprit lesion) and those who have remained asymptomatic with normal levels of physical activity during hospitalization. Post-discharge testing may also be considered in stable patients who will transition to an intermediate care setting that provides ongoing monitoring and medical treatment of the patient’s cardiac problems and medical comorbidities.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H527072406"><span class="h2">Pre-discharge stress testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pre-discharge exercise and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9380" href="/d/drug information/9380.html" rel="external">dobutamine</a> stress studies performed within 48 to 72 hours of infarction have typically utilized <strong>submaximal</strong> levels of stress to arbitrary end points such as 70 percent of age-predicted maximal heart rate or heart rate of 130 beats/min. The safety and short-term prognostic value of testing using these end points have been documented [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Patients who would benefit from a pre-discharge stress test include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with higher-risk NSTEACS features who would ordinarily undergo an early invasive strategy but have current contraindications or comorbidities that increase the risk of invasive procedures. This group includes patients with renal insufficiency or increased risk of bleeding including those with recent noncardiac surgery. The demonstration of significant ischemia identifies those who may benefit from coronary angiography and revascularization (or additional intensification of medical therapy in subjects who do not proceed with an invasive approach).

Stress testing is considered for both risk stratification and diagnostic purposes to determine the presence or absence of obstructive CAD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/43.html" rel="external">"Acute coronary syndrome: Terminology and classification", section on 'Definition of myocardial infarction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78730681"><span class="h1">WHO DOES NOT NEED A STRESS TEST?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stress testing is usually not needed in the following groups of patients (see <a class="local">'Who needs a stress test and when should it be performed'</a> above):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who have been completely revascularized.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with limited life expectancy due to medical comorbidities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who are not candidates for revascularization, based on comorbidities or results of coronary angiography showing anatomy that is not amenable to revascularization.

Serious complications such as myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrest, or death are rare, although the risk in the post-MI population is potentially higher given the increased prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease in these subjects. Contraindications to stress testing, both absolute and relative, are listed in a table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110" href="/d/graphic/80110.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The benefits of stress testing may outweigh the risks in some subjects with a relative contraindication to testing, in whom the potential information gained by assessment of exercise capacity, blood pressure response to exercise, symptoms, and ischemia may outweigh the small risk of complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1494.html" rel="external">"Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results", section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3738024906"><span class="h1">WHICH STRESS TEST IS PREFERRED?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to choose a particular stress test over other testing options should be made by incorporating clinical data, potential side effects, costs, and test availability. The choice of an imaging modality, when indicated, also depends on a variety of factors, including local availability, local expertise, cost, the patient's body habitus (eg, morbid obesity), limited acoustic windows for echocardiography (only if neither traditional nor contrast-enhanced echocardiographic imaging is adequate), radiation exposure, and the need for concomitant assessment of hemodynamics or valvular disease. The available modalities include exercise electrocardiography (ECG), exercise or vasodilator radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), exercise or pharmacologic (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9380" href="/d/drug information/9380.html" rel="external">dobutamine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9377" href="/d/drug information/9377.html" rel="external">dipyridamole</a>) stress echocardiography, and pharmacologic stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test", section on 'Our approach to choosing the optimal stress test'</a>.)</p><p>Nearly all patients who are anticipated to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo an exercise stress test rather than a pharmacologic stress test. Exercise is the preferred method of stress because of the information gained on functional capacity and the presence or absence of symptoms with physical activity [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In modern practice, an increasing proportion of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients undergo exercise stress testing with imaging or pharmacologic stress testing because of perceived intermediate or higher risk or factors that prevent or limit their ability to perform adequate exercise. This is particularly true for those referred for pre-discharge testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1534.html" rel="external">"Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease", section on 'Challenges in women'</a>.)</p><p>For decades, exercise ECG testing was the standard method for post-MI stress testing. When performed to an end point of symptoms or maximal exercise capacity, exercise ECG testing has moderate sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing obstructive coronary artery disease. However, many post-MI patients have ECGs that are uninterpretable which lowers the sensitivity of exercise ECG testing. Stress testing with some form of cardiac imaging has been shown to increase the accuracy and incremental prognostic value compared with exercise ECG testing without imaging [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. As such, in modern practice, nearly all post-MI stress testing employs some form of imaging, with SPECT radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography being the two most commonly used modalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1534.html" rel="external">"Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test", section on 'Comparison of different imaging techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Each stress modality has particular advantages and disadvantages, and there is some variability in the diagnostic and prognostic information provided. In general, our approach for choosing a specific stress testing modality is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115002" href="/d/graphic/115002.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). For example, a postinfarction patient with unexplained exertional dyspnea may be best evaluated using exercise echocardiography. The presence of mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and elevated left ventricular filling pressure can be assessed prior to exercise, and worsening of these conditions as causes of dyspnea can be assessed during bicycle exercise or immediately post-treadmill exercise [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The general approach to selecting the optimal stress imaging modality is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2102072116"><span class="h1">INTERPRETING THE STRESS TEST RESULTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk assessment of an individual patient should incorporate clinical risk factors, the hospital course, and response to medical therapy, in addition to the results of the stress electrocardiogram and imaging studies.

(See <a class="local">'Who needs a stress test and when should it be performed'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Who does not need a stress test? </strong>– Stress testing is usually not needed in patients who have been completely revascularized, patients with limited life expectancy due to medical comorbidities, and patients who are not candidates for revascularization, based on comorbidities or results of coronary angiography showing anatomy that is not amenable to revascularization. (See <a class="local">'Who does not need a stress test?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Which stress test is preferred? </strong>– The decision to choose a particular stress test over other testing options should be made by incorporating clinical data, potential side effects, costs, and test availability. Nearly all patients who are anticipated to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo an exercise stress test rather than a pharmacologic stress test. The choice of an imaging modality, when indicated, also depends on a variety of factors, including local availability, local expertise, cost, the patient's body habitus (eg, morbid obesity), limited acoustic windows for echocardiography (only if neither traditional nor contrast-enhanced echocardiographic imaging is adequate), radiation exposure, and the need for concomitant assessment of hemodynamics or valvular disease. (See <a class="local">'Which stress test is preferred?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management based on stress test results </strong>– Based on the provocative test findings, patients can generally be stratified into high, intermediate, and low risk, with subsequent management according to the identified risk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115003" href="/d/graphic/115003.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115004" href="/d/graphic/115004.html" rel="external">table 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115001" href="/d/graphic/115001.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with high-risk stress test findings – Patients with moderate to large or multiple areas of reversible ischemia or who have a high treadmill score are usually referred for coronary angiography and, if necessary, revascularization. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with low-risk stress test findings – Those with no ischemia on stress test and a low treadmill score have excellent long-term outcomes and generally do not require coronary angiography.
