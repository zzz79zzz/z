         Cancer of the endometrium is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed and resource-limited countries. Of the many histologic subtypes, endometrioid carcinoma is the most common and typically presents at an early stage with abnormal uterine bleeding. It is generally associated with a good prognosis. Other histologic types of endometrial carcinoma (eg, serous, clear cell) may not present with uterine bleeding and are often diagnosed at more advanced stages. As a result, these other types are associated with a poorer prognosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The stage at diagnosis  (

         </a>
         ) and histologic subtype of endometrial carcinoma are used to assign risk for recurrent or persistent disease into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk. This review will focus on adjuvant treatment for patients with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. An overview of endometrial cancer, including clinical features and an approach to diagnosis, and treatment of low- and high-risk and advanced endometrial cancer are discussed separately.

The approach to patients with LUS and no other risk features is discussed elsewhere. (See

         The adjuvant treatment options for women with intermediate-risk disease include observation or radiation therapy (RT), depending on whether the disease is considered low-intermediate or high-intermediate risk.

        <p>
         A subset of women are considered to have high-intermediate-risk disease based on certain pathologic criteria. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) criteria define high-intermediate risk, based on age and the following three pathologic factors:

        <p>
         Women have high-intermediate-risk disease if they are: age ≥70 years with one risk factor, age 50 to 69 years with two risk factors, or age ≥18 years with all three risk factors. We generally use these criteria,
         <strong>
          except
         </strong>
         we consider patients whose tumors are grade 3, deeply invasive (at least 50 percent of the myometrium) endometrioid cancers to be high-risk cancers rather than high-intermediate risk, irrespective of the age of the patient or whether other features are present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16721.html" rel="external">
          "Adjuvant treatment of high-risk endometrial cancers", section on 'Deeply invasive grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of the criteria for high-intermediate risk, all others are considered to have low intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. In the Gynecologic Oncology Group trial 99 (GOG-99), two-thirds of all recurrences were in women who met these pathologic criteria [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, the Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC) trials define high-intermediate risk by two of three clinicopathologic factors present: age &gt;60 years, outer one-half myometrial invasion, and grade 3 histology [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. In the PORTEC-1 trial, women who underwent observation had a higher rate of relapse in the pelvis if these criteria were met [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Notably, the highest-risk groups for recurrence (eg, grade 3, outer one-half myometrial invasion) were not eligible for treatment on this trial. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Is there a role for adjuvant chemotherapy?'

         For women with low-intermediate-risk disease, we suggest observation only rather than adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) or adjuvant chemotherapy. Given the overall good prognosis of these patients following surgical treatment, there is very little benefit to be gained from adjuvant RT or chemotherapy.

        <p>
         The lack of benefit of adjuvant RT was demonstrated in Gynecologic Oncology Group trial 99 (GOG-99), which randomly assigned 448 women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer to observation or adjuvant pelvic RT [

         For women with high-intermediate-risk disease, we suggest adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) following surgery rather than observation. RT can reduce the risk of a recurrence, although it does not appear to improve overall survival (OS). We suggest it for disease that is high intermediate risk, but not low intermediate risk, given higher baseline risk of recurrence and therefore higher absolute likelihood of benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of adjuvant RT for lowering the risk of a recurrence was demonstrated in Gynecologic Oncology Group trial 99 (GOG-99) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Among those with high-intermediate-risk disease, pelvic RT resulted in a reduction in the cumulative risk of recurrence at 48 months relative to observation (27 versus 13 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 90% CI 0.21-0.83), and a trend toward decreased local recurrences (5 versus 13 percent; HR 0.37, 90% CI 0.12-1.11). Despite this, there was no statistically significant reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.73, 90% CI 0.43-1.26), although the study was not powered sufficiently for this endpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the apparent lack of a significant OS advantage with adjuvant RT, some experts prefer not to administer adjuvant RT in this population. However, others prefer to administer adjuvant chemotherapy. The role of chemotherapy or concomitant chemotherapy plus RT specifically for women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer is discussed below.

         We suggest vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) for most women with high-intermediate-risk endometrial cancer, rather than pelvic radiation therapy (RT). While VBT and pelvic RT both decrease the risk of a local recurrence, pelvic RT is associated with more toxicity, including long-term urinary and bowel symptoms [

         Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is an attractive alternative to VBT, but is not yet widely available. A discussion on the technical aspects of RT for endometrial cancer is covered separately. (See

         VBT was associated with a significantly lower rate of treatment-related diarrhea and other bowel symptoms (13 versus 54 percent, respectively). In longer-term follow-up (seven years), patients receiving pelvic RT reported more bowel symptoms with impact on daily activities, and a trend for more urinary symptoms, although impact on overall quality of life was not affected [

         Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is typically accomplished using high-dose-rate therapy with an iridium-192 source, but also can be delivered using a low-dose rate. Treatment is initiated three to six weeks following surgery, although some experts prefer to wait up to nine weeks to reduce the risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence. VBT consists of three to five fractions given once or twice weekly on an outpatient basis. In general, the upper one-half to upper two-thirds of the vagina is treated; either vaginal ovoids or a vaginal cylinder can be used as applicators  (

          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The prescription dose depends upon the number of fractions and dose specification point (to the vaginal mucosa or to a depth of 5 mm), and several published fractionation schedules are accepted. One of the more common dose fractionation schedules employed is three once-weekly fractions of 7 Gy each, delivered to a depth of 5 mm from the vaginal mucosal surface.

         Given toxicity considerations, VBT is our preferred approach rather than pelvic radiation therapy (RT) for most patients with high-intermediate-risk endometrial cancer, although pelvic RT is a reasonable alternative if VBT is not available. (See

         As demonstrated in the PORTEC trial, pelvic RT resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of a locoregional recurrence compared with surgery alone (5 versus 14 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. However, pelvic RT is associated with both early and late complications [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13,14
         </a>
         ]. Early gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (eg, diarrhea or rectal bleeding) may occur in up to 60 percent of women treated with pelvic RT, and severe (grade 3/4) complications can be seen in up to 8 percent of patients. In addition, in the PORTEC study, the rate of late complications (predominantly affecting the GI and urinary systems) was significantly higher in the group treated with RT compared with those who underwent observation (26 versus 4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">

        <p>
         If VBT is not available, for whatever reason, pelvic RT may be used as an appropriate alternative. Planning and delivery techniques for pelvic RT require the use of a standard four-field beam arrangement. Care should be taken to ensure that the vaginal cuff and all locoregionally-draining lymphatics are included in the treatment fields. The typical dose in this setting is 45 to 50.4 Gy given in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy fractions over five to six weeks. Treatment generally is initiated six weeks after surgery to allow for adequate wound healing.

         Concerns about long-term toxicities and the lack of a survival advantage with pelvic RT in women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer have led to exploration of alternative modalities of treatment, such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Unlike conventional RT, the prescription dose used in IMRT is conformed to the target tissue in three dimensions, thereby reducing the dose of RT delivered to normal surrounding tissue. Experience with IMRT thus far has been promising, with low rates of both acute and chronic toxicity [

         There is increasing evidence and understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of endometrial carcinomas which may lead to better prediction of risk of recurrence and prognosis. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas identified four molecular subtypes: polymerase epsilon (POLE; ultramutated), deficient mismatch repair/microsatellite instability (hypermutated), copy number low (p53wt), and copy number high (TP53 mutated) with prognostic value of prediction of response to treatment and outcomes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128149" href="/z/d/graphic/128149.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the reproducibility of classification, there is increasing interest in incorporating molecular classification into treatment decision-making. For example, POLE-mutated tumors have been found to have better prognosis. Therefore, in early-stage disease, there is interest in de-escalation of therapy for POLE-mutated endometrial cancer. Incorporation of molecular classification into treatment planning is being looked at prospectively in several large, randomized trials (PORTEC4a and TAPER and the TransPORTEC RAINBO Umbrella Trial). PORTEC4a is an international phase III trial that randomly assigns high-intermediate-risk patients into molecular-integrated risk profile-based adjuvant treatment (observation, vaginal brachytherapy, or external beam pelvic radiation) versus vaginal brachytherapy alone, with primary outcome of vaginal recurrence rates. The TAPER study similarly is focused on de-escalation of therapy with primary outcome of pelvic recurrence. The TransPORTEC RAINBO trial classifies the four molecular subtypes and randomly assigns patients to treatment arms within each one. The paradigm of how we treat high-intermediate-risk endometrial cancer continues to evolve.

         The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) uses the following risk factors: older age, outer one-half myometrial invasion, grade 2 or 3 differentiation, or the presence of lymphovascular space invasion within the cancer, to determine whether cancers should be considered high-intermediate or low-intermediate risk, according to the table  (

          Grade 2B
