From roots, the brachial plexus then intricately converges and divides into trunks, divisions, cords, and branches to provide innervation to the entirety of the upper extremity.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Course of the brachial plexus </strong>–<strong> </strong>In the supraclavicular region, the brachial plexus coalesces to form the superior (upper; C5-6), middle (C7), and inferior (lower; C8-T1) trunks. The plexus then travels between the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the anterior border of the trapezius muscle, reorganizes into divisions, and ultimately continues under the clavicle to become the cords. The trunks of the brachial plexus lie adjacent to the subclavian artery. The superior and middle trunks are located either superior or lateral to the subclavian artery and adopt a more lateral position as they course distally. The inferior trunk is located immediately lateral to the subclavian artery in the space often referred to as the "corner pocket" formed by the first rib and subclavian artery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other nerves </strong>–<strong> </strong>Two clinically relevant nerves branch off of the brachial plexus at the level of the trunks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The suprascapular nerve most commonly branches off the superior trunk of the brachial plexus, with fibers derived primarily from the C5 and C6 nerve roots [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], and travels with the brachial plexus until ultimately separating off towards the shoulder. The suprascapular nerve runs along the lateral aspect of the brachial plexus in the supraclavicular region, just under the omohyoid muscle. (See <a class="local">'Ultrasound guided technique'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The nerve to subclavius (also called the subclavius nerve) emerges from the superior trunk before traveling to the subclavius muscle and the clavicle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576" href="/z/d/graphic/50576.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef129357" href="/z/d/graphic/129357.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104591" href="/z/d/graphic/104591.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood vessels </strong>–<strong> </strong>Vascular structures in the region of the supraclavicular block and potentially in the needle path include the subclavian artery and vein, and the dorsal scapular, suprascapular, and transverse cervical arteries  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106082" href="/z/d/graphic/106082.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pleura </strong>–<strong> </strong>The first rib and pleura lie just deep to the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Innervation </strong>–<strong> </strong>The brachial plexus trunks provide sensory and motor innervation of the entire upper extremity, often including the shoulder, with the exception of sensory block of the medial upper arm (intercostobrachial nerve, T2) and the cape of the shoulder which is innervated by C1 to C4 branches of the superficial cervical plexus [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The suprascapular nerve, which divides from the superior trunk, innervates the supraspinatus/infraspinatus muscles and acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The nerve to subclavius innervates the subclavius muscle and the periosteum of the clavicle.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cutaneous sensory innervation is shown in a figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131389" href="/z/d/graphic/131389.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).

Use of supraclavicular block for orthopedic trauma and for vascular access for dialysis is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/100073.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for orthopedic trauma", section on 'Anesthesia for upper extremity trauma'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1917.html" rel="external">"Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications", section on 'Anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anesthesia or analgesia below the shoulder </strong>–<strong> </strong>For analgesia at or distal to the level of the mid humerus the supraclavicular block should provide analgesia or anesthesia equivalent to more distal brachial plexus blocks (ie, infraclavicular or axillary blocks). For medial forearm and hand procedures, it is particularly important to inject local anesthetic around the inferior trunk (ie, at the "corner pocket") to anesthetize the nerve fibers from the C8 to T1 nerve roots  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106237" href="/z/d/graphic/106237.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Like other brachial plexus blocks, an intercostobrachial block is required for anesthesia or analgesia of the upper arm proximal to the elbow  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131391" href="/z/d/graphic/131391.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shoulder anesthesia and analgesia</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Supraclavicular block does not reliably provide complete surgical anesthesia for the shoulder because the suprascapular nerve (which innervates part of the shoulder) branches off the brachial plexus above the level of the block, as described above  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef129357" href="/z/d/graphic/129357.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Thus, for complete shoulder anesthesia, an interscalene block would be required, or a suprascapular block could be performed in addition to supraclavicular block. This combination would reduce the incidence of phrenic nerve block, compared with interscalene block, but the incidence of phrenic nerve block is still substantial with supraclavicular block. This is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Phrenic nerve block'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Supraclavicular block may provide adequate, though not complete, analgesia after shoulder surgery or injury. The literature comparing supraclavicular block with interscalene block (ISB) for shoulder analgesia is conflicting, with some studies finding superiority of ISB, and others no differences regarding analgesia and phrenic nerve block. In a meta-analysis of trials comparing ISB with supraclavicular block for shoulder analgesia, 24 hour <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/z/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">morphine</a> consumption and pain scores were similar, and the incidence of respiratory dysfunction was lower after supraclavicular block [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Conclusions from this study are limited by high heterogeneity and small sample sizes.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3621701791"><span class="h1">ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE VERSUS NERVE STIMULATOR GUIDANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest using ultrasound guidance whenever supraclavicular block is performed, rather than nerve stimulator guidance alone. Similar to performing other nerve blocks, we use ultrasound to identify the relevant structures, avoid blood vessels, visualize appropriate spread of local anesthetic, and in this case, to identify and avoid the pleura. Nerve stimulation may be used during ultrasound guided block to confirm correct position of the needle tip and to avoid intraneural injection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/397.html" rel="external">"Overview of peripheral nerve blocks", section on 'Block guidance techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasound guidance may improve supraclavicular block efficacy, efficiency and speed of onset [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and may theoretically reduce the incidence of pneumothorax [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], compared with the use of nerve stimulator guidance alone.</p><p>In a single institution trial, 80 patients who had supraclavicular block performed for distal arm or hand surgery were randomly assigned to block placement using ultrasound guidance with nerve stimulator confirmation, versus nerve stimulator guidance alone [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The addition of ultrasound guidance reduced the time to perform the block and resulted in a higher likelihood of complete block, particularly in the ulnar nerve territory. Successful surgical anesthesia and the need for general anesthesia were lower with ultrasound guidance, but the result was not statistically significant.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1566148363"><span class="h1">ULTRASOUND GUIDED TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3720229333"><span class="h2">Single versus multiple injections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest using a two-injection technique for supraclavicular block when the block is being used for surgical anesthesia, primarily to speed the onset of a complete block. We place one 10 to 15 mL injection of local anesthetic (LA) at the "corner pocket" formed by the subclavian artery, the first rib, and the brachial plexus, and another 10 mL at a more superficial location adjacent to the brachial plexus or, less commonly, among the nerves. This is the technique we describe here.</p><p>A single injection of 20 to 30 mL of LA at the "corner pocket" is a reasonable alternative, particularly if the block is intended to be used primarily for postoperative analgesia. A two-injection technique speeds the onset, which is important for surgical anesthesia but is not a concern for analgesic block. A single injection block saves time and reduces the amount of needle manipulation.</p><p>Studies comparing one versus two injections for supraclavicular block are conflicting with respect to onset time and block success.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one trial including 92 patients who were randomly assigned to single versus double injection supraclavicular block for anesthesia for surgery at or distal to the elbow, time to complete anesthesia was shorter with two injections (17.5 ± 8.4 versus 21.7 ± 7.2 minutes) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Success rates for surgical anesthesia were similar in the two groups (&gt;95 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another trial, 100 patients who had supraclavicular block for anesthesia for hand, forearm, or elbow surgery were randomly assigned to one versus two injections for the block [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The rate of complete sensory block at 15 minutes was similar after single versus double injection block (49 versus 53 percent). The rate of complete surgical block at 30 minutes was higher after double injection (90 versus 76 percent), though this result was not statistically significant.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2232336591"><span class="h2">Performing the block</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Position the patient with the head rotated to the contralateral side.

More concentrated solutions (eg, 2% lidocaine, 1.5% mepivacaine, 0.5% bupivacaine or 0.75% ropivacaine) are used for surgical anesthesia and muscle relaxation, versus more dilute solutions (eg, 0.25% bupivacaine or ropivacaine) used primarily for analgesia.</p><p>It is important to consider the required and maximum allowable dose of LAs, patient comorbidities that might impact appropriate dosing (ie, hepatic or cardiac disease), and other potential sources of LA administration (ie, surgical infiltration). Patients should always be monitored during and after the block for signs and symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity (LAST), as LA doses within standard limits may still produce high systemic LA blood levels following supraclavicular blocks. In one observational study of 21 supraclavicular blocks performed with a 3:1 by volume mixture of 2% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> with 0.5% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9169" href="/z/d/drug information/9169.html" rel="external">bupivacaine</a>, plasma lidocaine levels above the accepted toxic level occurred in one quarter of patients [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

Compared with other continuous brachial plexus blocks, advantages of supraclavicular block are the relatively shallow needle insertion angle, the ability to insert a catheter without the need for arm repositioning, and an insertion site that is easy to evaluate and monitor postoperatively (compared with axillary block). Continuous axillary block is rarely used because of relatively high risk of infection and the separation of the nerves at the level of the block, making coverage of multiple nerves with a single catheter challenging.

The nerves of the brachial plexus travel through the neck, under the clavicle, and into the arm  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70189" href="/z/d/graphic/70189.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>).

We use ultrasound to identify the relevant structures, avoid blood vessels, visualize appropriate spread of local anesthetic (LA), and to identify and avoid the pleura.
