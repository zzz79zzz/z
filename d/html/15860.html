         </span>
         In patients with difficult airways, supraglottic airways (eg, laryngeal mask airway or i-gel) permit oxygenation and ventilation until a definitive airway can be secured. Supraglottic airway devices may be lifesaving in children with difficult airways in whom conventional endotracheal intubation has failed. They should be available for any child undergoing emergency endotracheal intubation. This topic discusses the indications, contraindications, and techniques for use of such devices in children.

         Extraglottic airway devices are designed to provide oxygen and ventilation without direct entry into the airway (larynx) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Those devices that are placed above the glottis without extension of any components into the esophagus are also called supraglottic airway devices. Thus, a laryngeal mask airway is a type of supraglottic airway while a Combitube is an extraglottic airway that is
         <strong>
          not

         supraglottic.

          —
         </span>
         A contingency plan in the event of a failed endotracheal intubation should be developed for all patients, ideally before rapid sequence intubation is necessary (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112" href="/z/d/graphic/73112.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Clinicians should have rescue devices available whenever performing an emergency pediatric intubation. Rescue devices permit oxygenation and ventilation in situations where endotracheal intubation cannot be performed in a timely manner and can also facilitate endotracheal intubation in patients with difficult airways.
        </p>
        <p>
         A failed airway exists when the clinician cannot oxygenate or ventilate a patient. Clinically, this occurs when a patient cannot be intubated, and ventilation with a bag and mask or supraglottic airway device fails to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturations above 90 percent. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6391.html" rel="external">

         </span>
         The laryngeal mask airway and similar laryngeal tracheal devices (eg, King LAD, air-Q, i-gel, Ambu Aura, or CobraPLA) are the most versatile airway rescue devices for children and are available in sizes that permit placement in all pediatric patients (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67558" href="/z/d/graphic/67558.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         There is some evidence to suggest that one supraglottic device, the LMA Supreme (size 1) might be superior to BVM ventilation in neonatal resuscitation, making it a potential rescue airway for neonates [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Acquiring the skill to use these devices appears to be rapid with most providers able to successfully insert them in simulated difficult pediatric airway scenarios within 30 seconds, although the primary determinant of success with a particular device appears to be operator experience [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was first used in 1988, numerous similar devices have been developed. Some investigators describe the original devices, like the LMA Classic as "First Generation" supraglottic devices and later devices, with additional features as "Second" and "Third Generation" devices.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the "generation" to which the device belongs, these supraglottic devices all share a similar functional principle; if the peripharyngeal area can be occluded with a mask or balloon and the laryngeal opening can be isolated from the esophagus, the relatively lower resistance of the distal airway will permit ventilation without direct tracheal intubation. Because blind insertion of a supraglottic airway is likely to be much easier than tracheal intubation, these devices represent a true advance in airway management. Based upon operating room experience in children predicted to have a difficult airway, these devices permit successful airway management in over 90 percent of such patients [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. When comparing airway leak pressures, ease of insertion, first pass success rate, and the airway view via a fiberoptic bronchoscope when using the LMA Supreme, the AirQ, or the Ambu Aura-I, the LMA Supreme was easiest to insert and had the highest first pass success rate [
         <a href="#rid5">

         Supraglottic airway devices are likely to be used by the emergency care provider when standard airway management techniques have failed, and tensions are high. The patient’s life may well depend upon the clinician’s ability to secure an alternative airway, and the clinician will be under considerable stress. These are not the circumstances under which to use an unfamiliar device for the first time. Thus, emergency physicians and others who might need to use a rescue airway device should learn to use it well in advance of need. Training can be accomplished in a simulation center, a cadaver lab, or an operating room, depending upon the type of device and the availability of mentors [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, several organizations offer training in difficult airway management for emergency practitioners.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies suggest that successful placement of laryngeal mask airways in the first attempt after formal training is as high as 90 to 94 percent [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, there are data from the pre-hospital literature to suggest that providers using supraglottic airways are able to rapidly establish effective oxygenation and ventilation and that skill retention remains high with these devices, which is an advantage when providers are faced with a rarely-used technique in an emergency situation [
         <a href="#rid3">

         The LMA is widely used in children. It comes in sizes that permit placement in all pediatric patients (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67558" href="/z/d/graphic/67558.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The recommended approach to selection of an appropriately-sized LMA is based upon the child’s weight. When the weight is not known, use of an LMA with an outer diameter approximately the same as the child’s auricle is an alternative method that is practical and moderately correlates with the weight-based approach [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The LMA Supreme is a single use device that is similar to the ProSeal. It is available in sizes appropriate for use in infants and children. In anesthesia studies in children, LMAs can be successfully inserted on the first attempt 80 to 100 percent of the time, depending on the technique (rotational, lateral, or standard placement) and specific device (Classic LMA or ProSeal LMA) used [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most sources have recommended inserting the LMA until resistance to further insertion is felt. However the optimal depth of insertion can also be calculated using the child’s height and weight in the following formula:
        </p>
        <p>
         Depth of insertion (in centimeters) = 7.0 + 0.04 X Patient’s Height (in centimeters) + 0.05 X Patient’s Weight (in kilograms) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The Classic LMA is a scaled down version of the adult LMA while the pediatric ProSeal LMA has specific design features that may permit a better seal and greater protection against aspiration and gastric inflation, especially in infants and young children, including a gastric channel which permits passage of a nasogastric tube and gastric decompression while the LMA is in place [
         <a href="#rid13">

         The LMA may be effective in situations in which tracheal intubation is difficult or impossible, and when placed correctly can avoid the need for continuous mask seal during bag-mask ventilation. It can also be attempted in the "cannot intubate-cannot ventilate" situation, but care must be taken to ensure that the patient does not experience an excessively long period of hypoxemia. The LMA can serve as a bridge between bag mask ventilation and intubation and can facilitate the use of devices for difficult endotracheal intubation (eg, fiberoptic stylet, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope) [

         Like almost all supraglottic devices, the LMA is unlikely to be effective in cases of airway obstruction (eg, croup, asthma) when the pressure in the airway is higher than the sealing pressure of its mask, allowing air to leak around the mask cuff. It should not be used when the airway anatomy is significantly distorted (eg, laryngeal trauma, congenital anomalies of the larynx) or in patients with upper airway infection that distorts anatomy (eg, epiglottitis). However, in one operating room study, the LMA had a failure rate of less than one percent. In most cases, failure was related to airway obstruction or to coughing or "bucking" in an inadequately sedated patient [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The degree to which this information is applicable to the emergency department setting is unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
         The LMA provides less protection against aspiration than endotracheal intubation, but in situations requiring the insertion of a rescue airway, the risk of aspiration is generally outweighed by the benefits [
         <a href="#rid20">

         There are three techniques available for LMA placement: standard, rotational, and lateral. The standard technique is appropriate for children over seven years of age (see
         <a class="local">
          'Standard technique'
         </a>
         below). We recommend that clinicians use the rotational technique instead of the lateral or standard technique when placing LMAs in children under seven years of age (see
         <a class="local">
          'Rotational technique'
         </a>

         In a cross-over trial of 78 children between three months and 10 years of age undergoing elective eye surgery, the rotational technique was associated with a significantly higher success rate (96 versus 81 percent first pass success rate), lower time to successful insertion (12 versus 16 seconds) than the standard technique [

         An observational study of 158 children undergoing LMA placement by the standard technique for elective surgery found that significant malposition as seen by fiberoptic bronchoscopy was present in 72 to 80 percent of infants weighing less than 10 kg (LMA size 1.0 to 1.5) [

         Taken together, these studies indicate that placement of the LMA using the rotational technique in young children under seven years of age has a significantly higher success rate on first attempt and is associated with a significantly lower risk of airway trauma or laryngospasm.

         The i-gel is a unique supraglottic airway because it does not employ balloons to isolate the laryngeal opening. Instead, its cuff is made of a thermoplastic elastomer gel. Once inserted, the patient’s own body temperature helps the mask to conform to an appropriate configuration. The i-gel appears to function in a fashion similar to the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). However, it may cause higher positive inspiratory pressure and decreased tidal volume when the neck is flexed when compared with the LMA [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In studies comparing various types of supraglottic airways, the i-gel appears to offer the advantage of rapid insertion. For example, in a study of paramedics' use of several supraglottic airways in a manikin model, the i-gel was one of the three devices that was inserted most rapidly [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In another study, insertion of the i-gel by inexperienced physicians was compared with two other supraglottic devices (the AirQ and the Ambu AuraGain) in a manikin model of blind tracheal intubation for both normal and difficult airways and with and without continuous chest compressions [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. In this study, the i-gel was superior or noninferior to the other devices in all scenarios. Other potential advantages of the i-gel include an internal bite block to prevent the tube from collapsing should the patient awaken and clench the teeth and a gastric channel that, like the LMA ProSeal, allows for passage of nasogastric or orogastric tube to decompress the stomach. However, in one study of the i-gel, anesthesiologists found that the device had a tendency to be displaced upward, toward the mouth, and that attempts to reposition the tube could result in an inadequate airway. Nonetheless, the device was abandoned in favor of an alternative in less than 5 percent of cases [

         recommend that you use your fingers to facilitate insertion but instead they suggest that you guide the tube into place using only the ventilation tube. The size 3 to 5 i-gels have a line on the ventilating tube that indicates the appropriate depth of insertion. When this line is located between the patient’s central incisors, the i-gel is located at approximately the appropriate depth. The smaller sized i-gels do not have an indicator line.

         Because the i-gel lacks an inflatable mask that can compensate for size problems, appropriate size selection is especially important. As previously mentioned, one study found that it had a tendency to be displaced upward and that attempts to reposition the i-gel could lead to an inadequate airway. It was especially noted that flexion of the proximal portion of the tube toward the patient’s feet increased airway obstruction and that this was relieved by moving the tube toward the patient’s head [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. This might have significant implications for securing the tube in place. One series suggested that adequate sealing pressures were harder to obtain with smaller-sized i-gel tubes, and this may be a problem when positive pressure ventilation is used in such children [

         The ILMA is a modified laryngeal mask airway (LMA) designed as a conduit for tracheal intubation. It may be used in children weighing 30 kg or greater. Rather than a flexible ventilating tube, the ILMA has a U-shaped metal tube designed to accommodate a specially adapted, flexible, endotracheal tube. Within the mask is a lever which is intended to lift the epiglottis as the tip of the endotracheal tube passes through the mask. A special handle is attached to the side of the tube. This is intended to facilitate placement. Finally, the kit contains a rubber stabilizing bar which is used during tracheal intubation through the ILMA [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33
         </a>
         ]. A similar device (the air-Q masked laryngeal airway) permits intubation using standard endotracheal tubes through a supraglottic device in smaller children although there is limited evidence for its use in children.

         The ILMA permits successful fiberoptic endotracheal intubation in children under 30 kg by experienced airway specialists [

          34

         A small bougie may be directed through the ILMA and inserted into the trachea. This can then be used to guide the endotracheal tube into position. However, because the distal holes of the special endotracheal tube are smaller than the distal hole of a standard tube before using a bougie, first be certain that the bougie will pass easily through the tube.

         Some operators have used the ILMA to insert standard endotracheal tubes. This is somewhat more difficult than insertion of the specially designed tube. If a standard endotracheal tube is used with the ILMA, the tube should be thoroughly lubricated and inserted into the LMA with the curved portion of the tube facing the operator.

         The ILMA is likely to be ineffective in cases of airway obstruction (eg, croup, asthma) because the pressure in the airway will be higher than the sealing pressure of its mask, allowing air to leak around the mask cuff. It should not be used when the airway anatomy is significantly distorted (eg, laryngeal trauma, congenital anomalies of the larynx) or in patients with upper airway infection that distorts anatomy (eg, epiglottitis).

         If ventilation is successful then you may proceed with tracheal intubation. However, since the intubation attempt might leave the patient briefly apneic, the patient should be oxygenated before intubation is attempted. Furthermore, sedation and paralysis as for rapid sequence intubation may be necessary (

         Remove the ventilating bag and insert and advance the endotracheal tube while gently lifting the LMA. Passage of the endotracheal tube into the trachea may be facilitated by having an assistant apply slight pressure over the patient's thyroid cartilage. The endotracheal tube should advance easily. Significant resistance to passage suggests that the endotracheal tube is not entering the trachea and it should be removed and another attempt made after the patient has been ventilated and oxygenated.

         The main advantage of the air-Q is that it allows for ventilation in a fashion much like the standard LMA but is also designed to facilitate intubation using standard endotracheal tubes (ETT) in young children. Specifically, the ventilation tube of these devices is wide enough to allow the passage of the cuffs and pilot balloons of cuffed endotracheal tubes, thus overcoming a problem that limits intubation using some other devices. Intubation can be either be accomplished blindly or using a fiberoptic bronchoscope, optical stylet, or lighted stylet.

         Additionally, this device has a bite-block built into the tube to prevent tube occlusion if the patient awakens and clenches their teeth.

         Gently advance the air-Q into the pharynx using a downward and inward pressure. If necessary, the back of the left (or nondominant) index finger can be placed behind the mask and then finger flexion can be used to guide the tube into position.

         Once tracheal intubation is achieved, the clinician must decide what to do with the air-Q device. Options are to either safely leave it in place and remove it in a more controlled environment (eg, the ICU or operating room) at a later time or remove it as soon as tracheal intubation is accomplished. In most cases, the safest course of action is to leave the laryngeal airway in place with its cuff deflated until it can be removed electively. The removal technique is as follows:

         Some have suggested that blind intubation using the air-Q and similar devices is inadvisable in children because the epiglottis might actually lie within the mask and blind passage of an endotracheal tube could actually damage the epiglottis or other structures. These authors advocate the use of an intubation technique that employs direct visualization such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy, whenever possible [

         The CobraPLA (CPLA) differs slightly from other laryngeal or extraglottic airways. This device consists of a ventilation tube with a flexible "cobra-shaped" head at its distal end and a ventilation port at its proximal end (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85596" href="/z/d/graphic/85596.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The head is soft and flexible with a ventilation grill on one side. Immediately proximal to the head is a single ring-like balloon which is intended to occlude the hypopharynx. The CPLA is available in sizes appropriate for patients as small as 2.5 kg [

         The CobraPLA may be effective in situations in which tracheal intubation is difficult or impossible. It is likely to be more effective than bag-mask ventilation during resuscitation situations. It can also be attempted in the cannot intubate-cannot ventilate situation, but care must be taken to ensure that the patient does not experience an excessively long period of hypoxemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CobraPLA is unlikely to be effective in cases of airway obstruction (eg, croup, asthma) because the pressure in the airway will be higher than the sealing pressure of its mask, allowing air to leak around the mask cuff. It should not be used when the airway anatomy is significantly distorted (eg, laryngeal trauma, congenital anomalies of the larynx) or in patients with upper airway infection that distorts anatomy (eg, epiglottitis).

         The CobraPLA (CPLA) is usually easily inserted, although difficulties have been encountered in some patients with obesity. However, the primary difficulties associated with the CPLA are either not inserting the device far enough such that the ventilating surface does not cover the glottis or advancing it too far. In the former case, the tongue might be pushed out of the mouth, indicating the need to advance the CPLA further. In the latter case, ventilation will not be possible, and as in all such cases, the device should be removed and replaced. Additionally, the CPLA does not prevent aspiration [

         </span>
         Several manufacturers make laryngotracheal airways (eg, King LAD Airway, King LTD Supraglottic Airway, Portex Soft Seal Laryngeal Mask). Many function (and look) similar to the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), while others are designed to be placed directly into the esophagus, thus occluding it with a sealed distal balloon and facilitating air flow into the trachea. While these devices function in a fashion similar to an older device, the Combitube, they have two advantages over the Combitube. They are softer and therefore less likely to damage the esophagus, and they are available in multiple sizes so that they can be used in smaller children. For example the King LTD Supraglottic Airway, size 2 can be used in patients as small as 12 kg or 35 inches in height.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Combitube is rarely used in children, is primarily a pre-hospital device, and contains latex, which makes it less suitable for airway management in the emergency department.

         The major pitfall associated with these tools is inadvertent placement into the trachea. Other pitfalls include over-inflation of the balloons, which can distend the esophagus causing potential injury to the esophagus itself or compression of the trachea, and placement of the ventilating port too distally or too proximally to allow for effective ventilation.

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Supraglottic airway devices are placed above the glottis without extension of any components into the esophagus and permit oxygenation and ventilation until a definitive airway is secured and can facilitate endotracheal intubation. Clinicians should have supraglottic airway devices available whenever performing an emergency pediatric intubation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology'

          Choice of device
         </strong>
         – The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and similar laryngeal tracheal devices (eg, King LAD, air-Q, i-gel, Ambu Aura, or CobraPLA) are the most versatile airway rescue devices for children and are available in sizes that permit placement in all pediatric patients (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67558" href="/z/d/graphic/67558.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         The advantages of the LMA are (see

          LMA placement

         – The standard technique for LMA placement is appropriate for children over seven years of age (see
         <a class="local">
          'Standard technique'
         </a>
         above). We recommend that clinicians use the rotational technique instead of the lateral or standard technique when placing LMAs in children under seven years of age (

          Grade 1B

          i-gel
         </strong>
         – The i-gel is a unique airway device that employs a thermoelastic polymer rather than an inflatable cuff to achieve an effective airway seal. This device is available in sizes appropriate for very small children and appears to offer the advantage of easy insertion. The i-gel may be superior to other supraglottic airways when it is used as a conduit for blind tracheal intubation. (See

         Other devices that may be used in older children and adolescents but not in young children include the intubating LMA, the Air-Q, the CobraPLA, and laryngotracheal airways that are placed in the esophagus. Indications, contraindications, and placement techniques are described. (See
