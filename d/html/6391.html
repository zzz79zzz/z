         Effective airway management includes anticipating and planning for problems. Difficulties frequently occur as the result of patient characteristics that interfere with spontaneous breathing, bag-mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and/or intubation of the trachea. Identifying characteristics of the difficult airway and developing a plan for addressing problems are essential principles in airway management. Published guidelines exist for management of the difficult airway in anesthesia practice [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. These principles have also been modified and effectively used to evaluate adults patients in the operating room (OR) and emergency department (ED) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Children infrequently require advanced airway management and difficulties do not often occur [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Many of the difficult airway predictors, particularly anatomic abnormalities, are more common in adults. As a result, evidence specific for children regarding identification and management of difficult airways is limited [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, a reasonable, systematic approach for children can be developed from experience with adult patients in the ED and children in the OR. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117124.html" rel="external">

         A difficult airway is generally defined as a situation in which a clinician experiences difficulty with bag-mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, or tracheal intubation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In an emergency setting, this also includes difficulty performing supraglottic airway placement or an emergency surgical airway, such as needle cricothyroidotomy.

         Young children are prone to desaturation, even when optimally preoxygenated, due to their high native metabolic rate combined with a small pulmonary functional reserve capacity. Thus, airway management in children with compromised pulmonary function, as is seen with obstructive lung disease, pneumonia, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can be accompanied by rapid desaturation during intubation attempts even with meticulous attention to pre-procedure oxygenation.

          Misshapen head

         – Positioning of the head to optimally align the pharyngeal and tracheal axes may be difficult if the head is misshapen, as can occur with craniosynostosis (such as Apert or Crouzon syndrome) or macrocephaly. (See

         Epiglottitis is characterized by rapidly progressive inflammation and edema of the supraglottic structures. Airway management is difficult because laryngeal anatomy is distorted and the glottic opening may be small and difficult to identify. Since the introduction of conjugate Haemophilus influenza type B vaccines, the incidence of epiglottitis in children has declined dramatically. (See

         Croup and tracheitis cause subglottic airway obstruction. As a result, it may be difficult to deliver effective bag-mask ventilation, supraglottic airway placement and ventilation, or to pass an endotracheal tube through the subglottic trachea. Fortunately, both conditions generally respond to medical management. (See

         General emergency medicine specialists and anesthesiologists have used bedside evaluation tools to identify patients for whom airway management may be difficult.

         Alternative techniques for providing oxygenation and ventilation must be considered for the child who may be difficult to intubate. These techniques may be temporizing such as a supraglottic airway (eg, laryngeal mask airway, i-gel) or a percutaneous needle cricothyrotomy or provide alternative procedural approaches to endotracheal intubation (eg, intubating introducers or fiberoptic intubation). Several factors impact the choice of device including the clinical situation, type of airway difficulty, and experience of the operator.

         Video laryngoscopes (VLs) display the glottic view on a video monitor during endotracheal intubation and allow indirect or, when fitted with standard geometry blades, either indirect or direct laryngoscopy. Video laryngoscopy is becoming widely used by emergency medicine providers for pediatric endotracheal intubation. For children with difficult airways undergoing endotracheal intubation in the operating room, video laryngoscope has a higher first pass success rate than direct laryngoscopy. Practitioners with airway training and experience, including those who are early in their careers, can use these advanced laryngoscopes effectively with little additional training and orientation. Acute angle scopes may be difficult to use in young infants because of the size of the blade. A common problem is the inability to pass the endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords despite having an adequate view of the glottic opening. This is a more common problem in infants, in whom the bulky VL blade may make maneuvering the ETT into the pharynx more difficult, leading to lower rates of successful intubation with VL than in older children.

         Intubating introducers are helpful when the epiglottis is visualized but the vocal cords cannot be seen. They are contraindicated in patients with laryngeal or tracheal injury. These devices are semi-rigid solid or hollow rods with the distal tip bent at a 30-degree angle  (

         Supraglottic airways (eg, Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA), i-gel, and others) are available in multiple sizes suitable for infants, children, and adults. The appropriate size is based upon the patient's weight  (

          table 5

         ). The Classic LMA is a scaled down version of the adult LMA, while the pediatric ProSeal LMA has specific design features that may permit a better seal and greater protection against aspiration, especially in infants and young children, including a gastric channel which permits passage of a nasogastric tube and gastric decompression while the LMA is in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         In anesthesia studies in children, LMAs can be successfully inserted on the first attempt 80 to 100 percent of the time, depending upon the technique (rotational, lateral, or standard placement) and specific device (Classic LMA or ProSeal LMA) used.

         In the hands of a clinician with extensive training and experience with the device, use of a flexible intubating scope is an excellent method for endotracheal intubation for a patient with a difficult airway who is breathing spontaneously. Flexible intubation should be considered in cases where the pre-intubation assessment suggests that orotracheal intubation via rapid sequence intubation (preferred in most emergency department intubation scenarios) is unlikely to be successful and the patient is able to tolerate a longer intubation attempt. Examples include congenital airway anomalies such as micrognathia or conditions where difficulty aligning the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes is predicted (such as when neck mobility is limited)  (

In these patients, the clinician may elect to perform rapid sequence intubation and create conditions for the best, first attempt at airway management, understanding that if oral intubation fails, the patient would then transition to the failed airway algorithm  (

         A child with respiratory failure for whom bag-mask ventilation is not effective and the trachea cannot be intubated has a failed airway. This situation is often referred to as a "can't ventilate, can't intubate" scenario [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Prompt intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation is essential  (

          algorithm 2

         ). The most expert clinician available should be managing the airway.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no evidence to guide recommendations for management of these rare but life-threatening situations. Therefore, any intervention that could be possibly helpful and is unlikely to worsen the patient's condition should be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
         A supraglottic airway should be used initially for most children with failed airways except as noted above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Supraglottic airway'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A surgical airway should be performed for a child with a complete upper airway obstruction. A surgical airway should also be considered for children with airway conditions that could be worsened by injury from attempts to place a supraglottic airway (such as expanding hematomas, significant midface trauma, or large abscesses):

          Initial supportive care
         </strong>
         – All patients with respiratory distress and a potentially difficult airway should receive intensive supportive care, monitoring, timely treatment of the underlying condition, and development of an airway management plan. The clinician should avoid situations that could worsen airway compromise. (See

         If time permits and not contraindicated, the clinician may try noninvasive measures (eg, high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation) while arranging for definitive airway management. In some cases, noninvasive support alone may avoid the need for intubation. However, noninvasive measures should

Whenever possible, children with conditions that rapidly and predictably progress to involve edema and distortion of normal airway anatomy despite aggressive medical management (such as thermal or chemical airway burns) should undergo emergency endotracheal intubation in the operating room by the most experienced practitioner (eg, an anesthesiologist with pediatric expertise or similar airway expert and an otolaryngologist or surgeon with similar pediatric surgical airway expertise).

         – Children who are in extremis have a "cardiac arrest airway" and require bag-mask ventilation followed by orotracheal intubation  (

         <strong>
          Forced to act
         </strong>
         – If forced to act before all preparations can be made (eg, abrupt obstruction or those with rapidly progressive airway compromise), the clinician should perform bag-mask ventilation (BMV) to maintain oxygenation and then make one best attempt at orotracheal intubation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140479" href="/z/d/graphic/140479.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1B
         </a>
         ). For these patients, we suggest administering RSI medications including a paralytic  (

          table 7

         ) rather than performing awake intubation (

          Grade 2C
         </a>

          Failed airway
         </strong>
         – If BMV cannot maintain oxygenation and the trachea cannot be intubated ("failed airway"), the clinician should place a supraglottic device  (
