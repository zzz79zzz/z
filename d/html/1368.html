The following parameters are important for ensuring accuracy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Collection tube</strong> – Samples for testing coagulation must be drawn into a tube containing an inhibitor of coagulation that can be removed at the start of the assay. A sodium citrate solution (3.2 percent sodium citrate) in a tube with a light blue top is most commonly used. The amount of citrate solution in the tube is fixed to provide an appropriate ratio of one part citrate solution to nine parts whole blood when the tube is properly filled. Patients with polycythemia require removal of some of the citrate due to a reduced plasma volume. (See <a class="local">'Sources of interference'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood volume</strong> – The tube must be filled with enough blood to provide an appropriate ratio of citrate to whole blood. Underfilled tubes can result in artificially prolonged coagulation times. Tubes should not be uncapped as it will result in an incorrect volume of blood being added [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Tubes must be filled to within 90 percent of the full collection volume. If the tube is underfilled it may lead to inaccurate results. Improperly filled tubes should be discarded and a new draw requested [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Polycythemia effectively reduces the amount of plasma in the tube. (See <a class="local">'Sources of interference'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mixing</strong> – Because blue top tubes contain a liquid sodium citrate solution, they should be inverted gently a few times as soon as possible after phlebotomy, in order to mix the citrate solution with the blood. The tube should not be shaken as this can cause hemolysis and may lead to inaccurate results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elapsed time</strong> <strong>and temperature</strong> – The sample should be tested in a timely manner to avoid degradation of the labile coagulation factors (especially factors V and VIII and protein S); substantial degradation of coagulation factors could lead to artificial prolongation of coagulation times [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The total time between phlebotomy and testing should not exceed 24 hours. Primary coagulations tubes cannot be frozen prior to separation of plasma from cells.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17737815"><span class="h2">Sources of interference</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inaccurate results may occur if the following are present:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intravenous solutions</strong> – Ideally, coagulation specimens should be obtained by percutaneous phlebotomy. A discard tube is not required when drawing blood from percutaneous phlebotomy [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. However, in intensive care unit settings coagulation testing is often obtained from indwelling catheters. The sample must be free of solutions delivered through indwelling intravenous lines, which may dilute the sample and/or introduce heparin. This is especially important for blood obtained from central venous catheters or ports, which are often flushed with heparin or citrate solutions that could lead to artificial prolongation of coagulation times [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. When drawing samples from indwelling lines, the first few milliliters withdrawn are discarded, and the required sample is obtained from a second syringe or tube to avoid contamination with solution in the line.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anticoagulants</strong> – Good medical practice dictates awareness by the laboratory of anticoagulant therapy as this may greatly impact test interpretation and patient care. This may be done by the physician as part of the order entry procedure, by the laboratory personnel checking patient medications in the electronic medical record, or by contacting the ordering physician directly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other substances</strong> – Other substances present in the sample such as lipids or bilirubin due to lipemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hemolysis can interfere with determination of clotting times. If it is not possible to avoid such an interference, dilution of the sample may allow an estimate of the clotting time. The need for sample dilution can be assessed by the laboratory at the time of testing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Polycythemia (eg, hematocrit &gt;55 percent) causes a corresponding reduction of plasma volume in the blood collection tube. Thus, patients with polycythemia require removal of some of the citrate solution to maintain the correct ratio of citrate to whole blood and to prevent artificial prolongation of coagulation times [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. There are no corresponding recommendations for severe anemia. The best approach to such situations is to be aware of the potential interference and to contact the coagulation laboratory for guidance in proper collection if accurate clotting times are required for patient care.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1882137942"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC TESTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10463901"><span class="h2">Clotting times</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clotting times measure the time it takes plasma to clot when various substances are added. The citrate in the blue top collection tube chelates calcium in the collection tube so that coagulation is unable to proceed, because calcium is required for assembly of coagulation factor complexes on activated cell surfaces or phospholipids. Sufficient calcium to overcome the chelator is added back to the sample at the time of test initiation, along with a source of phospholipid and an initiator (tissue factor for the prothrombin time [PT]; silica or diatomaceous earth for the activated thromboplastin time [aPTT]). The precise composition of PT and aPTT reagents is proprietary and generally not disclosed. PT instrument reagent systems are standardized using the international normalized ratio (INR). (See <a class="local">'Prothrombin time (PT) and INR'</a> below.)</p><p>While the PT and aPTT provide an overall assessment of clot formation, they do not provide information about fibrin crosslinking or clot dissolution and will thus be insensitive to abnormalities of factor XIII function or abnormal fibrinolysis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Prothrombin time (PT) and INR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prothrombin time (PT) measures the time it takes plasma to clot when exposed to tissue factor, which assesses the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998" href="/d/graphic/79998.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemostasis", section on 'Extrinsic pathway'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemostasis", section on 'Thrombin generation'</a>.)</p><p>The PT test is performed by recalcifying citrated patient plasma in the presence of tissue factor and phospholipid and determining the time it takes to form a fibrin clot. The formation of a fibrin clot is detected by visual, optical, or electromechanical methods. The result is measured in seconds and reported along with a control value and/or an INR.</p><p>The normal range for the PT varies by laboratory and reagent/instrument combination, and local institutional ranges should be used. In most laboratories, the normal range is approximately 11 to 13 seconds.</p><p>The INR is dimensionless. It is calculated as a ratio of the patient’s PT to a control PT obtained using an international reference thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), using the following formula [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent2">INR  =  [Patient PT ÷ Control PT]<sup>ISI</sup></p></div></div><p></p><p>The control value for the PT is the mean normal PT for the laboratory determined from ≥30 fresh, normal plasmas handled identically to patient material. The ISI (international sensitivity index) is based on an international reference thromboplastin reagent; however, it is useful to have the ISI value confirmed within each laboratory for each PT reagent and instrument to account for effects of handling and equipment performance [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>Unlike the PT, the results of the INR will be similar on a blood sample tested in any laboratory using any thromboplastin reagent/instrument system when calibrated correctly. This allows comparison of the patient’s testing performed at different times and/or locations, which is of great benefit for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> monitoring (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1334.html" rel="external">"Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects"</a>). Use of the INR is also extremely valuable for research studies because it allows investigators to compare the degree of anticoagulation of patients from different institutions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1473802"><span class="h4">Uses of the PT/INR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical uses of the PT include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation of unexplained bleeding – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnosing disseminated intravascular coagulation – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obtaining a baseline value prior to initiating anticoagulation – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1348.html" rel="external">"Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1334.html" rel="external">"Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitoring <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> therapy – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1334.html" rel="external">"Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of liver synthetic function – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3566.html" rel="external">"Tests of the liver's biosynthetic capacity (eg, albumin, coagulation factors, prothrombin time)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>As noted above, the INR was developed to allow patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> at steady state to compare values obtained at different times and from different laboratories. The INR is also commonly used as a surrogate for the PT in assessing integrity of the extrinsic and common pathways in bleeding patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998" href="/d/graphic/79998.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and to assess end-stage liver disease as part of the model for end-stage liver diseases (MELD) score.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1473808"><span class="h4">Causes of prolonged PT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Causes of a prolonged PT include the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969" href="/d/graphic/79969.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vitamin K</strong><strong> antagonists</strong> – Vitamin K antagonists such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> interfere with post-translational modifications of procoagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X, resulting in a prolonged PT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1334.html" rel="external">"Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Monitoring (PT/INR)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other anticoagulants</strong> – Heparins (unfractionated or low molecular weight) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8691" href="/d/drug information/8691.html" rel="external">fondaparinux</a> should in theory prolong the PT because they inhibit thrombin and/or factor Xa. However, most PT reagents contain heparin-binding chemicals (eg, heparinase, polybrene) that block this effect [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The PT may become elevated at heparin concentrations above 1 unit/mL, such as after a heparin bolus, due to saturation of the heparin binders. The increase in PT should not be used to guide therapy; monitoring of heparins is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1348.html" rel="external">"Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Laboratory monitoring and dose titration (unfractionated heparin)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1348.html" rel="external">"Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Laboratory monitoring/measurement (LMW heparins)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">All of the available direct acting anticoagulants prolong the PT, including the parenteral direct thrombin inhibitor <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8765" href="/d/drug information/8765.html" rel="external">argatroban</a> and the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8926" href="/d/drug information/8926.html" rel="external">dabigatran</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99275" href="/d/drug information/99275.html" rel="external">edoxaban</a>. However, the degree of prolongation varies by the particular drug and the PT reagent used, and therefore the PT is not reliable for monitoring drug effect. All of the DOACs are approved for use without monitoring. We do not check the PT in an individual receiving a DOAC and we do not make changes to dosing or monitoring of these agents based on the result of the PT, with the possible exception of an individual who has serious bleeding for whom a prolongation of the PT may be taken as evidence of persistent drug effect. These subjects are addressed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1370.html" rel="external">"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and parenteral direct-acting anticoagulants: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Laboratory testing and monitoring (dabigatran)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1370.html" rel="external">"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and parenteral direct-acting anticoagulants: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'General considerations for direct factor Xa inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vitamin K</strong><strong> deficiency</strong> – Potential causes include impaired nutrition, prolonged use of broad spectrum antibiotics, or fat malabsorption syndromes. When vitamin K deficiency is mild, only the PT may be prolonged due to a predominant effect on factor VII. However, in severe vitamin K deficiency, both the PT and aPTT may be prolonged. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2624.html" rel="external">"Overview of vitamin K", section on 'Vitamin K deficiency'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/479.html" rel="external">"Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects", section on 'Hematologic reactions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Liver disease</strong> – Liver disease may be associated with decreased production of both vitamin K-dependent and vitamin K-independent clotting factors. When liver disease is mild, only the PT may be prolonged due to a predominant effect on factor VII. However, in severe and/or chronic liver disease, both the PT and aPTT may be prolonged. Importantly, liver disease is also associated with decreased production of anticoagulant factors. Thus, a prolonged PT does not reflect the overall hemostatic picture. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13932.html" rel="external">"Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease", section on 'Physiologic effects of hepatic dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DIC</strong> – In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coagulation factors become consumed and depleted.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factor deficiency</strong> – Deficient activity of coagulation factors in the extrinsic pathway may be due to inherited disorders or acquired inhibitors (eg, autoantibodies). This includes deficiency of fibrinogen and factors II, V, VII, or X, or a combined deficiency involving one of these factors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1336.html" rel="external">"Rare inherited coagulation disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1305.html" rel="external">"Acquired hemophilia A (and other acquired coagulation factor inhibitors)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antiphospholipid antibodies</strong> – Lupus anticoagulants or antiphospholipid antibodies with specificity for prothrombin (factor II) may cause hypoprothrombinemia and prolongation of the PT; occasionally patients with such antibodies and high antibody titers present with hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding.

Mixing studies are useful because they distinguish between an abnormally prolonged clotting time due to a factor deficiency versus a factor inhibitor. Inhibitors typically are autoantibodies that interfere with coagulation factor function in the patient (eg, acquired factor VIII inhibitor) or in the laboratory test (eg, lupus anticoagulant). Other interfering substances that can also act as inhibitors include heparins, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8691" href="/d/drug information/8691.html" rel="external">fondaparinux</a>, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and elevated C-reactive protein [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>].</p><p>Mixing studies can be performed for any of the standard coagulation tests, including the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT).</p><p>Discussion with the consulting hematologist and/or laboratory personnel may be helpful to ensure that appropriate testing is done in a timely fashion.</p><p>Mixing studies are performed by measuring the clotting time of the patient’s plasma diluted serially with normal plasma. The clotting time of a 1:1 mixture of patient plasma and normal plasma can be measured immediately upon incubation, and after incubation at body temperature (typically, two hours).

This is because a 1:1 mix with normal plasma will provide at least 50 percent activity of any factor required for the test, which is more than sufficient to normalize the clotting time. If the 1:1 dilution corrects the abnormal test, the deficient factor(s) can be determined by individual clotting factor assays. The coagulation factor(s) evaluated depends on which clotting test is prolonged  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969" href="/d/graphic/79969.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Assays for specific coagulation factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Multiple factor deficiency</strong> – Certain conditions can cause deficiency of multiple coagulation factors. Examples include severe liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, and rare inherited coagulation disorders that affect more than one factor.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13932.html" rel="external">"Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2624.html" rel="external">"Overview of vitamin K", section on 'Vitamin K deficiency'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1336.html" rel="external">"Rare inherited coagulation disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1090052"><span class="h3">Clotting time does not correct</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most factor inhibitors will not correct in a mixing study. This is because most antibodies will not be sufficiently diluted by an equal volume of normal plasma to result in correction of the clotting time. Importantly, however, some antibodies do not act immediately on their target coagulation factor. This delayed activity is characteristic of factor VIII inhibitors [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. In such cases, the mixing study will appear to correct at the early time point, but will not correct after one or two hours of incubation. The laboratory should report results from the immediate mix as well as after incubation.

Early involvement of the consulting hematologist and/or appropriate laboratory personnel is advised as some of these conditions can cause potentially life-threatening bleeding (eg, acquired factor inhibitors), thrombosis (eg, antiphospholipid antibodies), or both (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]).</p><p>Common causes of coagulation inhibitors and their evaluations include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DOACs</strong> – In our institution, the presence of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the sample, most often direct factor Xa inhibitors, are the most common cause of a prolonged aPTT referred for testing.

A lupus anticoagulant that affects the aPTT will not correct in a mixing study with normal plasma, but it will correct with excess phospholipid. If an aPL is suspected, the dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) or low phospholipid content aPTT reagent (eg, aPTT-LA) can be used to evaluate this possibility.

Serial dilutions of patient plasma are mixed with normal plasma until the proportion of patient plasma is reduced to the point that the mixing study does correct. The titer often is reported in Bethesda units (BU); the titer is equal to the reciprocal of the dilution of patient plasma that results in 50 percent factor activity. The titer correlates with the strength of the inhibitor (ie, the stronger the inhibitor, the higher the titer).
