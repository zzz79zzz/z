         Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure can be encountered in the emergency department and inpatient units, as well as in postoperative and intensive care units. Acute hypercapnia is often not suspected, leading to delayed diagnosis. If left untreated, acute hypercapnic respiratory failure may become life-threatening resulting in respiratory arrest, seizures, coma, and death.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to adult patients with suspected hypercapnia, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure are discussed in this topic. For the most part, this topic discusses the approach in patients who are spontaneously breathing, although many of the same principles can be applied to patients who are receiving invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support. The mechanisms, etiologies, and end-organ effects associated with hypercapnia are discussed more extensively separately.

         Hypercapnia is defined as an elevation in the arterial carbon dioxide (CO

         ) tension (PaCO
         <sub>

         ). The CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         level in arterial blood is directly proportional to the rate of CO

         (VCO

         ) production and inversely proportional to the rate of CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         elimination by the lung (alveolar ventilation). Alveolar ventilation (V
         <sub>
          A
         </sub>
         ) is, in turn, determined by minute ventilation (V
         <sub>
          E
         </sub>
         ) and the ratio of dead space (V
         <sub>

         ) to tidal volume (V

         ) (V

         production rarely results in clinically important hypercapnia. Etiologies associated with hypercapnia are listed in the table  (

         Hypercapnia should always be suspected in those who are at risk for hypoventilation (eg, sedative use, history of sleep apnea) or have increased physiologic dead space and limited pulmonary reserve (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation) who present with shortness of breath, a change in mental status, new hypoxemia, and/or hypersomnolence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The presenting features of acute hypercapnia are variable with no signs or symptoms that are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis. Patients can present with the manifestations of hypercapnia itself as well as with the manifestations associated with the underlying disorder, both of which are discussed in detail in the sections below. It is important to remember that tachypnea does not always equate to increased alveolar ventilation; patients with increased dead space and mechanical abnormalities of the respiratory system may have elevated respiratory rate and accessory muscle use, yet still be hypercapnic.

         Due to the wide range of etiologies for hypercapnia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091" href="/z/d/graphic/103091.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), the presenting features from the underlying disorder can be variable and frequently overlap. However, the presence of an underlying disorder or risk factor should increase the suspicion for hypercapnia and prompt arterial blood gas analysis (though venous blood gas analysis can also be used). Clinicians should look for a history of common risk factors, including sedative use/abuse, the signs and symptoms of chronic lung disease (eg, clubbing with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis, hyperinflation, thoracic cage abnormalities, cyanosis from associated hypoxemia), and obvious central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders (eg, hemiplegia, obesity, snoring, neuromuscular weakness). A commonly missed presentation of acute hypercapnia is the postoperative patient/post anesthetic patient who becomes hypoxemic due to hypoventilation. There is a tendency to treat hypoxemia by giving supplemental oxygen, which may worsen the hypercapnia, lead to more hypoxemia, and further increases in supplemental oxygen ultimately resulting in a vicious cycle and respiratory failure. (See
         <a class="local">

          Sedative use

          COPD or other lung disorders

         – During an exacerbation or in response to oxygen administration, some patients with COPD (but not all) develop acute or acute-on-chronic hypercapnia. Similarly, patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease (ILD) may present with acute hypercapnia. The diagnosis of COPD or ILD may be known or may be evident by a long smoking history together with the typical clinical signs of COPD or ILD, which are discussed separately.

Acute hypercapnia is always accompanied by a respiratory acidosis (pH &lt;7.35) that is appropriate for the degree of hypercapnia, whereas chronic hypercapnia is associated with a low-normal or near normal pH (assuming the patient has normal renal function and the ability to excrete acid by the kidney), and acute-on chronic hypercapnia lies in between these parameters  (

         Acute respiratory acidosis is present when an abrupt failure of ventilation occurs (eg, central nervous system disease or drug-induced respiratory depression, severe acute airways disease) or there is an acute process that worsens alveolar ventilation in a patient with limited pulmonary reserve (eg, pneumonia in a patient with COPD). Chronic respiratory acidosis develops over days to weeks such that bicarbonate rises as an indication that renal compensation, ie, secretion of acid, has occurred (usually more than three to five days; eg, COPD, chronic neuromuscular disorders). In mild acute respiratory acidosis, the serum bicarbonate typically rises by a 2 to 5 meq/L as CO

         and H

          2
         </sub>
         O combine to form carbonic acid, which dissociates to a bicarbonate molecule and a proton. Buffering of carbonic acid in red blood cells by hemoglobin also contributes to the acute rise in serum bicarbonate. It is important to note that the metabolic compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis is secretion of acid by the kidney; the elevated serum bicarbonate in this scenario is a byproduct of acid secretion and does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         play a role in buffering the respiratory acid.

Since the range for a normal gradient increases with age, the expected gradient for an individual can be approximated by the equation A-a gradient = age x 0.3. An A-a gradient within the normal range in the setting of an elevated PaCO
         <sub>

         is

          highly
         </strong>
         suggestive of global hypoventilation, whereas a widened gradient suggests that underlying lung disease may be contributing to the measured hypercapnia. Measuring the A-a gradient is more readily applied to patients in the chronic stable state and difficult to perform in patients with acute presentations because patients with acute hypercapnia often require the immediate application of supplemental oxygen, which precludes calculating a room air A-a gradient; however, if feasible, it is appropriate to draw an ABG prior to initiation of supplemental oxygen. An A-a gradient can also be reliably determined in situations where the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
         <sub>
          2

         ) is accurate (eg, mechanical ventilation).
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, global hypoventilation from sedatives is likely the primary cause of hypercapnic respiratory acidosis in an otherwise healthy young drug abuser with somnolence, a normal chest radiograph, positive toxicology screen, and a normal A-a gradient of &lt;20 mmHg. In contrast, abnormal gas exchange from increased dead space in patients with a COPD exacerbation or end stage interstitial lung disease (ILD) is typically associated with the usual clinical signs and symptoms of a COPD or ILD exacerbation and an ABG that reveals hypercapnia and a widened A-a gradient.

         A high clinical suspicion for the presence of hypercapnic respiratory failure is critical for diagnosis. An initial efficient and targeted history from prehospital or hospital providers, the patient, their relatives, and/or the medical record should provide ample information on a patient's risk for hypercapnia, as well as the potential etiology  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). For the detection of common etiologies, this may include a review of prescribed medications, a drug history, past history of chronic lung disease, sleep apnea, or a neuromuscular disorder, a smoking and travel history as well as a history of recent trauma. For patients on oxygen, recent changes in the flow settings should be assessed. Once patients are stable and the diagnosis of hypercapnic respiratory failure is made, a more detailed approach to the history should be undertaken with a specific etiology in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
         Physical examination should be directed towards uncovering the cause of hypercapnia. The evaluation should include an assessment of sensorium, mucous membranes, asterixis, lungs, heart, thoracic cage, and abdomen, as well as skin and joints. A brief neurologic examination should also be performed to distinguish the many central and peripheral neurologic etiologies associated with the development of acute and/or chronic hypercapnia.

         – An elevated bicarbonate level may suggest underlying chronic hypercapnia at baseline, although this feature is nonspecific as other etiologies (eg, volume contraction, diuretics) can increase the bicarbonate concentration. Similarly, arterial blood gases drawn on previous admissions or in the chronic stable state may identify the presence of normocapnia or chronic hypercapnia at baseline.

         There are no imaging abnormalities that are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of hypercapnia. A chest radiograph should be performed in most patients who present with acute hypercapnia to look for intrapulmonary pathology that may be associated with the development of hypercapnia. Additional imaging tests can be obtained on an individual basis to identify suspected etiological risk factors. As examples:

         – A chest radiograph or computed tomography of the chest may reveal underlying COPD (eg, hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms) and interstitial lung disease (reticular nodular shadows), as well as thoracic cage abnormalities (kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum, ankylosing spondylitis, fractured ribs) or diaphragmatic paralysis (unilateral or bilateral elevation of diaphragmatic leaflets). The latter may also readily be diagnosed with point of care ultrasound.

         Serial bedside measurement of vital capacity and negative inspiratory force is of value in predicting progressive or resolving hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with myasthenic crisis, the details of which are discussed separately. A vital capacity less than 1 L in a patient with normal baseline lung function warrants observation in an intensive care unit because of the increased risk of acute respiratory failure. Notably, the fall in vital capacity may occur prior to the rise in PaCO

         While typically there is no value in obtaining a full set of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients who present with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, some patients may have previous PFTs with obstructive or restrictive physiology that may help to determine any underlying etiology.

Apneic patients should receive higher initial doses of naloxone (0.2 to 1 mg). Patients in cardiorespiratory arrest following possible opioid overdose should be given a minimum of 2 mg of naloxone.

         administration in chronic users of BDZ is controversial due to the risk of withdrawal seizures and the inconsistent effect on the reversal of respiratory depression. However, it appears to be safe and effective when used to reverse the sedating effects of a BDZ given acutely in patients who do not use them chronically (eg, for procedural sedation). In adults, the recommended initial dose is 0.2 mg given IV over 30 seconds. Repeated doses of 0.2 mg, to a maximum dose of 1 mg, can be given until the desired effect is achieved. The biggest disadvantage of flumazenil is that it is short-acting. In the event of resedation after initial administration, the dosing regimen described here can be repeated, but no more than 3 mg of flumazenil should be given within any one hour. Although infusions are available they are rarely used. Further details regarding flumazenil are provided separately.

         Some patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure benefit from the application of bag-valve mask or noninvasive ventilation (NIV).

         Patients most likely to benefit from NIV are those with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

         Close monitoring and early reevaluation are critical to the success of NIV. Thus, vigilant clinical monitoring of vital signs and follow up blood gas analysis is necessary to identify those in whom NIV is successful as well as those who fail NIV, in whom mechanical ventilation is indicated. The optimal trial period for NIV is unknown. However, based upon data derived from patients with COPD, those who respond are likely to do so in the first two hours and patients who fail to respond within that time period have an increased chance of requiring mechanical ventilation.

The degree of hypoxemia is variable and depends upon the cause of respiratory failure and presence of underlying chronic lung disease.

In this section, we discuss the risk of developing hypercapnia and how to safely administer and titrate oxygen in this population.

In such cases, mechanical ventilation can be avoided by a reduction in supplemental oxygen with or without noninvasive ventilation. However, the clinician should avoid marked hypoxemia as FiO

         The risk of hypercapnia in patients with neuromuscular disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) when supplemental oxygen is administered has been less well studied than among patients with COPD. One retrospective series found that among eight patients identified with neuromuscular disease, seven had baseline hypercapnia, and six had worsening of their hypercapnia by a mean of 28 mmHg after receiving low flow supplemental oxygen [
         <a href="#rid12">

         Once the patient has been evaluated at the bedside, there are no agreed upon criteria for intensive care unit (ICU) admission other than the need for NIV or intubation and mechanical ventilation. ICU admission for severe hypercapnia respiratory failure is typically due to COPD or obesity hypoventilation syndrome [

         However, common reasons for admission may include the need for frequent monitoring, fine titration of supplemental oxygen, and the prolonged application of noninvasive ventilation. Examples of patients who may be considered for ICU care include patients with severely impaired consciousness, patients with respiratory muscle fatigue (eg, neuromuscular disorders) and patients not improving on NIV, as well as and patients with severe acidosis (eg, &lt;7.25) and indications for admission other than hypercapnic respiratory failure. In patients with neuromuscular disease, vital capacity less than 1 L is also an indication for monitoring in an intensive care setting.

         In contrast, other patients with an etiology for acute hypercapnia that is easily reversible may require minor additional supervision and may not even require hospital admission (eg, benzodiazepine-induced hypercapnia following conscious sedation for a minor procedure) once it has been established that it will not recur.

         Maintenance therapy of acute respiratory acidosis is primarily directed at treating the underlying disorder and reversing the acute hypercapnia back to baseline levels. Baseline for many patients is normocapnia. However, in patients who are chronically hypercapnic prior to admission, a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO

          Mechanical ventilation
         </strong>
         – Mechanical ventilation should be continued in those in whom it was initiated until the hypercapnia has resolved. Alternatively, it should be administered to those who fail initial therapies. The indications for and management of patients mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure, including those with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are discussed separately.

There are no clinical features that are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of hypercapnia, because the presenting features are usually those of hypercapnia itself as well as features due to the underlying disorder (eg, oxygen administration, sedatives, COPD).

          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – When patients present with suspected hypercapnia, the clinician should simultaneously assess and stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation; perform a brief clinical bedside assessment with telemetry and oxygen monitoring; draw an arterial blood gas (ABG); and administer initial empiric bedside therapies. With this approach, once the diagnosis is made and the patient is stabilized, the etiology can usually be determined or narrowed to a few possibilities, such that subsequent testing and therapies can be appropriately tailored.

          Bedside assessment
         </strong>
         – A brief history and examination should be performed at the bedside, so that therapies targeted at a specific underlying cause can be administered quickly. In addition to ABGs, a complete blood count, serum chemistries including bicarbonate and electrolytes, and a chest radiograph should be performed. Once the patient is stable, subsequent testing (eg, toxicology screen, thyroid function tests, chest or brain imaging) and therapies can then be appropriately tailored. (See
