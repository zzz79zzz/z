         Pediatric anesthesia differs in important ways from anesthesia for adults. This topic will discuss general principles of preanesthesia preparation, induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, and emergence from anesthesia for the healthy child undergoing routine surgery.

          History and physical examination –
         </strong>
         All children should be evaluated with a preanesthesia medical history, review of systems, and an anesthesia directed physical examination. The preanesthesia evaluation is similar to that of an adult, with modifications appropriate for the child's stage of development, pediatric physiology, and family history. Important components of the preoperative history and physical examination for a child are shown in tables  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A preanesthesia airway evaluation, including assessment of predictors of difficulty with airway management, should be performed in children, as it would be for adults, with particular attention to findings which may be associated with difficult intubation, such as reduced thyromental distance (micrognathia), decreased mouth opening, reduced neck mobility, or large tongue. The components of the airway examination for children are shown in a table  (

          Laboratory assessment –
         </strong>
         Preoperative laboratory testing should be individualized, based on patient factors and institutional norms. Routine laboratory studies are usually not required in healthy children.
        </p>
        <p>

         <strong>
          Hematologic testing –
         </strong>
         Preoperative hemoglobin testing is unnecessary for most healthy children, as it is not likely to yield useful information. In one study, routine hemoglobin testing found previously undetected anemia in only 0.29 percent of children scheduled for elective day surgery [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Infants under four months of age may have physiological anemia and be at their postnatal hemoglobin nadir, but hemoglobin is rarely less than 8 g/dL. This level of anemia is not likely to delay surgery or affect outcome for the procedures commonly performed for young infants, such as inguinal hernia repair.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         A complete blood count (CBC) should be measured preoperatively in children with chronic illnesses associated with anemia such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and those who are taking drugs that may affect blood cell production (eg, anticonvulsants such as
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12873" href="/z/d/drug information/12873.html" rel="external">
          valproate
         </a>
         ). CBC and coagulation studies should be performed in patients with a suspected, known, or a family history of bleeding disorders, and prior to surgery that is likely to result in significant bleeding, such as tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, cleft palate repair, and intracranial procedures.

          Electrolytes –
         </strong>
         Preanesthesia measurement of electrolytes is rarely necessary in healthy children, but should be performed in children with renal insufficiency, endocrine disorders, in those taking diuretics, or in children with history of vomiting/diarrhea, and those who have limited fluid intake because of enteral feedings.

         <strong>
          Pregnancy testing –
         </strong>
         Preoperative pregnancy testing for menarchal females, including adolescents, is controversial. A small percentage of young women may present for elective procedures with an unsuspected pregnancy, and history alone may be unreliable for predicting possible pregnancy in teenagers [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of a positive preoperative pregnancy test in adolescents has been reported to be 0.5 to 1.2 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Elective procedures that require anesthesia are avoided during pregnancy, because of the risks of surgery, anesthesia, and ionizing radiation for the pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Advisory for Preanesthesia Evaluation states that preanesthesia pregnancy testing may be offered to females of childbearing age [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, teenagers are often uncomfortable discussing sexual activity or the possibility of pregnancy, and may be unable to rationally choose whether to undergo pregnancy testing. Therefore, in many institutions, including the authors', all female patients &gt;12 years of age, and menarchal females &lt;12 years of age who undergo anesthesia or sedation are required to have a urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test performed on the day of the procedure [
         <a href="#rid8">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Routine pregnancy testing raises potentially difficult ethical, confidentiality, and consent issues. A positive pregnancy result may be best handled with the assistance of a social worker, child life, or mental health professional.

          Patient selection for outpatient anesthesia –

         Surgical procedures are increasingly performed on an outpatient, or ambulatory, basis. Postoperative admission to the hospital may be required because of the surgical procedure (eg, major abdominal or orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery), or specific patient clinical conditions.

         Ex-premature infants (born before 37 weeks gestation) are at risk for apnea after anesthesia or sedation. This risk decreases with increasing postmenstrual age (PMA) (ie, gestational age plus chronological age) with minimal risk between 56 and 60 weeks postconception. Ex-premature infants may require recovery room level of care overnight after anesthesia. (See

          Perioperative respiratory adverse events –

         Perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) are more common in children than adults, and are of greater concern. PRAEs include laryngospasm, bronchospasm, coughing, and oxygen desaturation, which occur most commonly during anesthetic induction and emergence. These events are more likely in children &lt;2 years of age, especially those with a recent upper respiratory infection or asthma, but they can occur in any child. One goal for anesthetic management for children should be the prevention of PRAEs. (See

          Anesthetic neurotoxicity –
         </strong>
         The effect of anesthesia and surgery on the developing brain is an area of active research and interest. In December, 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings about potential risks of negative effects on the developing brain from administration of anesthetics and sedative drugs to pregnant women and children under age three, especially for repeated exposures or procedures lasting more than three hours [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. However, the labeling change is recommended based on evidence from animal and not human studies. The degree of risk remains unclear, and the best available evidence suggests that a single, brief exposure to anesthesia does not cause neurotoxicity in healthy young children. The effects of anesthesia and surgery on the brain in young children are discussed separately. (See

          Mortality –
         </strong>
         Mortality related to anesthesia is very rare in healthy children (likely &lt;1/200,000 anesthetics), as it is in adults, though the true incidence is unclear. Perioperative cardiac arrest and mortality are more common during cardiac surgical procedures, in patients with significant comorbidities, and in infants and neonates. Data regarding the incidence of pediatric perioperative cardiac arrest and death come from prospective and retrospective reviews [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ] and registry studies [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ], with small numbers of events, and heterogeneity of patient populations and procedures. In one review of almost 93,000 pediatric anesthetics between 1988 and 2005 at a tertiary center, mortality for children who underwent noncardiac procedures was 1.6 per 10,000 anesthetics, compared with 115.5 per 10,000 anesthetics for cardiac procedures [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Most cardiac arrests (88 percent) occurred in patients with congenital heart disease, and the majority of cardiac arrests were caused by factors unrelated to anesthesia.

         Oral intake is routinely restricted before anesthesia, in an attempt to reduce gastric contents and therefore the risk of aspiration  (

         ). However, prolonged preoperative fasting can increase anxiety and cause hypovolemia and hypoglycemia, especially in infants and young children. Clear liquids should be encouraged in healthy young children up to two hours prior to elective surgery, and parents or caregivers should receive specific instructions on which liquids are acceptable (ie, water,

         <a href="#rid20">
          20

Many anxious parents or guardians who think their children require their presence for induction become more relaxed and able to separate when they see the child relaxed and giggling after the

They should be prepared for potentially disturbing events during induction (holding the mask on the child's face, eye movements, alterations in breathing pattern), and they should realize that their role is to focus on and reassure their child, rather than to watch the monitors. The parent/guardian should expect to be escorted out of the operating room once the child is no longer benefitting from the presence of the parent. Establishing expectations in advance of induction is often greatly appreciated by the parent or guardian who may otherwise witness an unsettling event.

         Blood pressure cuffs are available in a range of sizes, and use of a correctly sized cuff is important for accurate measurements. We have available four cuff sizes from infant to adult, and five neonatal cuff sizes. The cuff should have a bladder with a width that is approximately two-thirds the length of the upper arm, and a length that encircles 80 to 100 percent of the upper arm. We use the same sizing when the cuff is placed on the lower leg (ie, cuff width two-thirds the length of the lower leg). Undersized cuffs tend to give falsely elevated readings, while oversized cuffs give falsely low readings  (

         Disposable and reusable pulse oximeter probes are available in pediatric sizes. In older children the probe is usually placed on a finger or ear lobe, similar to adults. In neonates and infants, the probe should be placed wherever the probe fits best, which may be the great toe, the thumb, or the outer aspect of the foot or palm. The probe should be positioned with its two diodes directly opposite one another to obtain an accurate reading.

         Inhalation induction, with administration of anesthetic gas by face mask, is the most common induction technique in young children, and is used primarily to avoid the trauma of intravenous (IV) catheter placement while the child is awake. However, an IV allows the clinician to administer anesthetic and emergency medication with a rapid effect. Therefore, IV induction is preferred for patients who require rapid endotracheal intubation for airway protection, for some patients with a high likelihood of difficulty with airway management, for those at risk for cardiovascular instability during induction, and for patients with contraindications to the use of inhalation anesthetics (eg, at risk for malignant hyperthermia). IV induction may be preferred for patients with the following conditions:

         Induction of anesthesia typically occurs more slowly during inhalation induction, and the patient spends more time in the excitement stage of anesthesia, often referred to as Stage II  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107796" href="/z/d/graphic/107796.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ). The stages of anesthesia were initially developed to characterize the increasing depth of anesthesia with ether as the sole anesthetic, and are less relevant with newer, more rapidly acting inhalation anesthetics. Nonetheless, the idea that patients go through a period of excitement and delirium (Stage II) during induction and emergence from anesthesia is an important concept. During Stage II, patients are at risk for laryngospasm, coughing, and vomiting. For this and other reasons, IV induction may be preferred for children who are at particularly high risk for laryngospasm and other perioperative respiratory adverse events (eg, patients with recurrent wheezing or recent upper respiratory infection). (See

         Inhalation induction is faster in healthy children than it is in adults, because of differences in pulmonary and cardiac physiology. Cardiac output in children is higher than it is in adults, and in general, higher cardiac output slows the uptake of inhalation anesthetics. Nonetheless, uptake and distribution of volatile anesthetics is more rapid in children because of their increased respiratory rate, and because a higher proportion of cardiac output is distributed to the organs of pharmacologic effect (ie, brain, solid organs), compared with adults. The speed of induction is also influenced by the fresh gas flow, concentration of delivered inhalation anesthetic, and controlled ventilation, in addition to the physicochemical properties of the specific inhalation agent.

         Children are at risk for hypotension with administration of high doses of inhalation anesthetic agents during induction. Cardiac output and blood pressure are dependent on heart rate and preload in children, primarily because their cardiac ventricles are relatively noncompliant. Thus, the bradycardia that may be associated with high concentrations of inhalation agents may be poorly tolerated. Bradycardia can be minimized by gradual increase in the concentration of inhalation agent during induction. If bradycardia occurs,

         The reduction in airway tone associated with anesthesia and their relatively large tongue predisposes children to airway obstruction during induction. Jaw thrust, oral or nasopharyngeal airways, and continuous positive airway pressure with a tight mask seal are all strategies for maintaining a patent airway during mask ventilation, similar to adults.

In children at risk for hypoglycemia (eg, infants under six months of age whose hepatic immaturity precludes effective gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis, or those with muscle or metabolic disease), dextrose-containing fluids should be available for correction of low blood sugar. If glucose-free fluids are administered in infants &lt;6 months of age for surgery lasting &gt;60 minutes, blood glucose should be monitored utilizing point-of-care (POC) fingerstick testing intraoperatively. Dextrose-containing fluids may also be administered as an infusion to maintain euglycemia if necessary but should not represent the mainstay of maintenance or repletion fluid and blood sugar should be monitored (for hyper- as well as hypoglycemia) as mentioned above.

         ). Whereas weight based functional residual capacity and tidal volume are similar, minute ventilation and oxygen consumption are markedly higher in infants. This means that neonates and small infants desaturate quickly during apnea, and there is less time to take corrective action. The high chest wall compliance, and protuberant abdomens of young infants favor lung volume loss under anesthesia. As closing capacity can exceed functional residual capacity (FRC) in infants, maintenance of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is important to prevent atelectrauma.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the development of sophisticated flow meters in modern anesthesia machines, traditionally children were ventilated by pressure-driven modes, as very small tidal volumes were difficult to set and sense with accuracy. Pressure control ventilation with auto flow adjustment for changes in compliance is most commonly used. Such adjustments are particularly important during abdominal insufflation for laparoscopy, as in adults. The tidal volume is followed, and peak pressure or inspiratory time is increased if tidal volume falls. (See

         Maintenance of normothermia during anesthesia is important in all patients, and is especially important in small children. Hypothermia has been associated with delayed emergence, altered pharmacokinetics, poor tissue perfusion, and potential reversion to transitional circulation in the neonate. In addition, vasoconstriction from hypothermia can make intravenous (IV) access particularly difficult in small children.
        </p>
        <p>
         Infants and small children are at risk for hypothermia if exposed to cold environments for several reasons. The surface area to mass ratio of the infant is twice that of the adult, infants have thin skin and are unable to shiver to generate heat, and the relatively large head (ie, up to 20 percent of total skin surface area) may be a significant source of heat loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         Forced air or water warming blankets and intravenous fluid warmers should be routinely used, and the patient should be kept covered as possible. The operating room temperature should be raised during skin preparation and before draping.

         Regional anesthesia is increasingly used in pediatric anesthesia, either for postoperative pain control, or as the sole anesthetic. Regional anesthesia reduces the required doses of other anesthetics and opioids; this may be beneficial for patients at high risk of postoperative apnea (eg, neonates, patients with obstructive sleep apnea).

         The goal should be to achieve a smooth, controlled emergence from anesthesia, without laryngospasm or bronchospasm, oxygen desaturation, coughing, or vomiting. The endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway can be removed once the patient is awake, or at a deep level of anesthesia, but should not be removed during the excitement stage (ie, Stage II) as the patient emerges. Airway manipulation, including extubation, can cause laryngospasm during Stage II.

         We extubate most patients awake. The choice between awake and deep extubation is based on patient factors and clinician preference. Awake extubation allows the return of airway tone and airway protective reflexes, and theoretically reduces the risk of post-extubation airway obstruction and laryngospasm. However, in children with risk factors for bronchospasm, or in whom coughing should be avoided for surgical reasons, deep extubation may be preferred. In one small study, there were no differences in any adverse respiratory events or oxygen desaturation between children randomly assigned to deep versus awake extubation after general anesthesia [

         Prior to awake extubation, the neuromuscular blocking agent (if used) should be completely reversed, the oropharynx should be suctioned, the patient's eyes should be conjugate (rather than deviated) as a sign of recovery from anesthesia, and the patient should respond by grimacing or opening eyes in response to stimulation or suctioning. A single institution prospective observational study of 600 pediatric awake intubation found that five factors were each associated with successful extubation, including presence of conjugate gaze, facial grimace, eye opening, purposeful movement, and tidal volume &gt; 5 mL/kg.

         </span>
         We remove most supraglottic airways (SGAs) while the patient is still deeply anesthetized. Awake removal of an SGA allows return of airway tone and protective reflexes while a patent airway is maintained. However, an SGA does not protect against aspiration or laryngospasm during emergence, and the patient may cough, bite on the LMA tube, gag, or vomit during emergence. If the patient bites on the tube while emerging, it may be impossible to remove the device, or to ventilate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to remove an SGA deep or awake should be based on patient factors and clinician preference, and data to support either choice is inconclusive [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. A meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials in adults (five studies) and children (11 studies) reported no difference in laryngospasm or oxygen desaturation with deep versus awake SGA removal [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. Coughing was less frequent after deep removal (13.9 versus 19.4 percent) but airway obstruction was more common (15.6 versus 4.6 percent). The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was low or very low.
        </p>
        <p>
         Awake removal of an SGA may be preferred in patients who have copious upper airway secretions, anatomic airway obstruction, or bleeding in the airway.

        <p>
         After removal of the SGA, an oral airway should be placed, ventilation should be maintained by mask, and the anesthetic agent should be discontinued. The patient should be transferred to the PACU stretcher or bed with care taken to avoid neck flexion, which could cause stimulation of the larynx by the oral airway with positioning to ensure continued airway patency. The patient should be transported to the PACU with oxygen administration via Mapleson circuit or other apparatus capable of delivering continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or positive pressure ventilation.

          Induction
         </strong>
         – Inhalation induction, with administration of anesthetic gas by face mask, is the most common induction technique in young children. Intravenous induction may be preferred for patients with obesity, high risk of aspiration, and the need for malignant hyperthermia precautions. (See
         <a class="local">

         Inhalation induction occurs more rapidly in children than in adults because of differences in pulmonary and cardiac physiology. Children are at risk for bradycardia and hypotension with administration of high doses of inhalation anesthetics during induction. (See

         The goal for oxygen saturation for neonates is lower than for older children and adults (90 to 94 versus &gt;95 percent), and the fraction of inspired concentration of oxygen should be set accordingly. Ventilation should be set to maintain end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO
