         Polyarticular pain in an adult is encountered frequently in clinical practice. The causes include various self-limited illnesses and others that are potentially disabling and life-threatening. The history and physical examination generally provide the most useful diagnostic information; supporting or confirmatory data are obtained from laboratory and imaging studies or, more rarely, from tissue biopsy. A complete history and physical examination are appropriate for all patients presenting with polyarticular joint pain, since this symptom may be the initial manifestation of a systemic illness.

         The diagnostic possibilities can be narrowed substantially depending upon whether or not arthritis is present  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79481" href="/z/d/graphic/79481.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Among those in whom there are symptoms and signs of synovitis, the further evaluation is limited to those diseases which cause polyarthritis. In the absence of clear-cut arthritis, the focus shifts to nonarticular sources of pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the lengthy list of diseases that cause polyarthritis, most patients with inflammatory arthritis appear to have only one of a few possible disorders. Among over 200 patients with early synovitis (defined as less than one-year duration) evaluated at one academic center, 60 percent were diagnosed with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or a spondyloarthropathy at presentation or during the following year [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The prognosis is relatively good for those who remain unclassifiable, with nearly one-half of such patients undergoing remission and not requiring any pharmacologic therapy at follow-up at one year.

         Although the information obtained in the history is seldom sufficient to lead to a specific diagnosis, it allows substantial reduction in reasonable options. An acute presentation with migratory arthritis and fever, for example, is characteristic of rheumatic fever, disseminated gonococcal infection, and viral arthritis.

         The evaluation of polyarticular pain begins by ruling out potential musculoskeletal emergencies. These conditions generally have an acute presentation and are more commonly associated with monoarticular or oligoarticular pain. Some of these emergencies, however, can be seen in patients with polyarticular pain, and failure to make the correct diagnosis could lead to permanent harm to the patient. Important historical points include the following [

         It is important to obtain a detailed history of the character of the joint pain, including pain quality, time of onset, exacerbating or remitting factors, and duration.
        </p>
        <p>
         The quality of the pain may be useful in distinguishing musculoskeletal from neurologic causes. The latter is suggested when pain is "burning" or is accompanied by numbness or paresthesias. Neuropathic pain is also likely to be constant, to be intensified at night, and to be unrelated to motion. However, an individual patient may experience more than one type of pain. As an example, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) frequently have neuropathic pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The two main categories of arthritis, inflammatory and noninflammatory, can often be distinguished based upon the character and distribution of joint pain:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         With inflammatory arthritis, symptoms tend to worsen with immobility; this accounts for the typical morning stiffness and "gelling" that typically accompanies inflammatory arthritis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In contrast, the pain of osteoarthritis (OA), the most common type of noninflammatory arthritis, is usually aggravated by motion and weightbearing and is relieved by rest.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The joint involvement in RA is usually symmetrical, whereas asymmetry is frequent in OA, especially in the large joints. Problems such as bursitis, tendinitis, or sprains and strains are also asymmetrical in most cases.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The duration of symptoms may also be helpful. Synovitis that has been present for less than six weeks could represent a viral arthritis or systemic rheumatic disease, whereas a longer duration would increase the likelihood of the latter. The ability to accurately classify patients with early inflammatory arthritis is difficult. In one study of 211 patients with recent-onset synovitis, 36 percent could not be classified and were designated as having "undifferentiated arthropathy" after follow-up of 33 weeks [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         The presence of extraarticular symptoms may help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Weakness suggests a neurologic or myopathic disorder. On the other hand, signs and symptoms of multisystem involvement (such as fatigue, rash, adenopathy, alopecia, oral and nasal ulcers, pleuritic chest pain, Raynaud phenomenon, or dry eyes and mouth) are common in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. Fever, night sweats, and weight loss may also suggest systemic illness.

         After a complete history, the physical examination is used to further narrow the differential diagnosis. As an example, acute lower-extremity pain may have many causes; however, septic arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, or fracture should be suspected when the pain results in inability to bear weight, or is associated with soft tissue swelling and other signs of inflammation extending far above or below the involved joint.

         Reduced active range of motion with preserved passive range of motion suggests soft tissue disorders such as bursitis, tendinitis, or muscle injury. If both active and passive ranges of motion are decreased, soft tissue contracture, inflammatory or noninflammatory joint disease, or a structural abnormality of the joint should be considered [

         Concomitant axial pain or stiffness suggests the possibility of axial spondyloarthritis or another seronegative spondyloarthritis. As a result, spinal tenderness, deformity, and range of motion should always be ascertained in patients with polyarticular joint pain.

         Complaints of widespread musculoskeletal pain, soft tissue tender points, and prominent somatic symptoms (such as fatigue or cognitive disturbance) characteristic of fibromyalgia are particularly important to identify in patients who have no objective abnormalities in the joints (see

         Laboratory studies are not always necessary to make a diagnosis and, in fact, can be misleading. As an example, some patients with osteoarthritis (OA) may have abnormal results that actually reflect other unrelated conditions. In addition, in some patients with arthralgias and myalgias without physical findings, managing symptoms and carefully following the patient over several weeks may be more prudent than an initial battery of tests. Laboratory testing is also unnecessary when a mechanical problem has been identified [

         When the initial history and physical exam do not yield a diagnosis, however, some diagnostic testing may be indicated. Standard hematologic tests, urinalysis, and biochemical tests (renal and liver function) may help to identify patients with systemic illnesses. Other more specialized tests are discussed below.

         Nonspecific indicators of inflammation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), may be helpful in distinguishing between inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. However, these tests are never diagnostic and may be abnormal in a vast array of infectious, malignant, rheumatic, and other diseases [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         Some patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease have a normal ESR. As an example, in one series of 9135 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the ESR was normal in 70 percent, and the CRP was normal in 71 percent [

         Despite these limitations, the ESR and/or CRP may provide useful clinical information when a certain diagnosis is favored based upon the history and physical findings. In an older patient with aching and stiffness in the hip and shoulder girdle areas, for example, the post-test probability of polymyalgia rheumatica increases if the ESR or CRP is markedly elevated. However, normal inflammatory tests do not preclude the diagnosis.

         The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test has high sensitivity but low specificity for SLE. Therefore, unless another cause is evident, it is generally appropriate to order an ANA in patients with polyarthritis since a negative test essentially rules out a diagnosis of SLE. A positive ANA may occur, however, in many rheumatic and nonrheumatic illnesses as well as in healthy individuals. Thus, a patient with few or no clinical features of SLE is unlikely to have the disease, even in the presence of a positive ANA. (See

         Synovial fluid analysis may be diagnostic in patients with bacterial infections or crystal-induced synovitis. Synovial fluid analysis is also valuable to permit classification into an inflammatory or noninflammatory category or to identify hemarthrosis. Patients with established rheumatic disease present a particular challenge as it may be difficult to distinguish a flare of the underlying disease from a new, concomitant disorder, including infectious arthritis. While the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical guidelines suggest that synovial fluid analysis be performed in the febrile patient with an acute flare of established arthritis [

         Imaging studies are expensive and are not required routinely in the evaluation of polyarticular pain. Even when useful, it is seldom necessary to obtain radiographs of all involved joints; those joints with the highest yield in the differential diagnosis should be chosen for imaging. As an example, if rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the suspected diagnosis, erosions are best visualized in the wrist, hand, and foot.

         In acute conditions, radiographs usually lack diagnostic specificity and are generally not helpful for patients with new onset of RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), gout, tendinitis, or bursitis. In several acute settings, however, plain films may be useful. Chondrocalcinosis, for example, may be seen in calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease (see

On the other hand, abnormalities of the sacroiliac (SI) joints are the earliest radiographic finding in ankylosing spondylitis and suggest seronegative spondyloarthropathy as the cause of peripheral polyarthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than plain film radiography in detecting early SI joint abnormalities. (See

         grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10

          General approach to polyarticular joint pain
         </strong>
         – When the history and physical examination are used in concert with selected sequential laboratory and imaging studies, the cause of polyarticular joint pain can be identified in most cases. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines make the following general recommendations after completion of a thorough history and physical examination  (

         <strong>
          &gt;6 weeks' duration
         </strong>
         – In the presence of synovitis and symptoms greater than six weeks in duration, consider rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other systemic rheumatic diseases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74266" href="/z/d/graphic/74266.html" rel="external">

         ). A complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), antinuclear antibody (ANA), plasma creatinine concentration, and urinalysis should be obtained. Joint aspiration should be considered if an effusion is present and if the diagnosis is uncertain, especially if septic or crystal-induced arthritis is suspected.

         – In the presence of synovitis and symptoms less than six weeks in duration, a complete blood count, measures of liver function tests, and, in some cases, serologic testing for hepatitis B and C and parvovirus may be helpful  (

          Absence of synovitis
         </strong>
         – In the absence of synovitis, the physical examination finding of tender points suggests fibromyalgia or multiple sites of bursitis or tendinitis; further diagnostic testing may not be needed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5624.html" rel="external">

         In the absence of synovitis and tender points, consider the remainder of the differential diagnosis  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ) and consider liver function tests, hepatitis B and C serology, radiographs, and serum levels of thyrotropin (TSH), calcium, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase. When synovitis is suspected by the clinical presentation but cannot be confirmed by physical examination, ultrasound or MRI may be useful techniques to detect subclinical synovitis or erosions. (See

          Disease course

         – A combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data can help to differentiate patients likely to have self-limited disease from those likely to have persistent arthritis. Close follow-up will typically reveal the diagnosis. (See
