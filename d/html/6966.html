Evaluation of pulmonary disability for social security or workers' compensation assessments is an important aspect of clinical care. Examples include the cigarette smoker with severe emphysema who is no longer able to do his or her job, the auto body worker with isocyanate-induced asthma, the retired coal miner with pneumoconiosis, the business executive with severe sleep apnea, or the plumber or ship builder with lung cancer or asbestosis. </p><p>An approach to the evaluation of pulmonary disability that largely reflects the recommendations in the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 6th Edition, will be reviewed here [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The routine clinical evaluation and management of the specific conditions noted above are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2791.html" rel="external">"Disability assessment and determination in the United States"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438211"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16050214"><span class="h2">WHO model of disablement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health, known more commonly as the ICF [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The ICF is WHO's framework for measuring health and disability at both the individual and population levels. Unlike its predecessor, which was endorsed for field trial purposes only, the ICF was endorsed for use as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability. This model is composed of health and health-related domains that reflect body, individual, and societal perspectives  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86412" href="/d/graphic/86412.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The components of functioning and disability include body function and structure and also activities and participation. Consideration of environmental factors takes into account that an individual's functioning and disability occur in a context that may be influenced by their immediate and general environment.</p><p>The American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 6th Edition, has embraced this classification system because it incorporates the complex and dynamic interactions between an individual's medical condition, the environment, and personal factors [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Further, it recognizes that the relationships between impairment, activity limitations, and participation are fluid and multidirectional. For instance, an individual may have measurable impairment without significant impact on activity level, either in work or recreation, or conversely, they may report major activity limitation without significant demonstrable objective impairment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Impairment ratings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physicians are typically asked to provide an impairment rating based upon quantitative objective measurements. This rating is generally submitted to a Social Security Board, Workers' Compensation carrier, or other administrative body that will determine the final degree of disability. Physicians' impairment ratings are usually given heavy weighting in determining the degree of disability. Other socioeconomic factors are given varying degrees of import in the final evaluation.</p><p>In the United States, the most common system of pulmonary impairment rating is based upon the American Medical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], which in turn incorporate many of the recommendations found in the American Thoracic Society (ATS) official statements on assessing impairment for respiratory diseases [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and the various ATS\European Respiratory Society (ERS) statement standards for performance of spirometry [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>], interpretation of pulmonary function tests [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], exercise testing, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9622" href="/d/drug information/9622.html" rel="external">methacholine</a> challenge testing [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. Additionally, the ATS has published an official statement for a standard format for reporting pulmonary function tests [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>The AMA guides have also drawn on the recommendations from the ATS guidelines for the assessment of disability and impairment secondary to asthma [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In addition, certain occupational groups with specific occupational exposures well-known to cause lung disease have their own standards for evaluating disability. Examples of these groups include the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], coal miners (the Black Lung Benefits Act) [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>], cotton workers (Cotton Dust Standard) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], and longshore workers involved in ship building (Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>Despite the attempts of guidelines to provide objective criteria to judge impairment and disability, there still remain numerous circumstances in which strict adherence to such formulations is problematic. The latest iteration of the guidelines attempts to address some of these issues but challenges remain in certain cases to decide on the most objective yet comprehensive approach to determining the degree of impairment [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Assessment of disability necessitates a thorough knowledge of the demands of different types of work, as well as the patient's motivation and capacity for retraining. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Medical Association (AMA) Guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], which are similar to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 1986 statement [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], provide an approach to the assessment and rating of pulmonary impairment and disability. Many jurisdictions, including most State Workers' Compensation programs and programs in other countries, use similar criteria to varying degrees. A comprehensive review of different state and international systems is beyond the scope of this chapter. Physicians should check with the pertinent jurisdiction as to the specific criteria used for assessment of pulmonary impairment and disability.</p><p>The AMA guidelines categorize dysfunction into five classes that are based upon different percentages of impairment of the whole person  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94780" href="/d/graphic/94780.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class 0 – minimal to no impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class 1 – 2 to 10 percent impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class 2 – 11 to 23 percent impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class 3 – 24 to 40 percent impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Class 4 – 45 to 65 percent impairment </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">History and physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history and physical examination are critical on two important fronts: first, the diagnosis and evaluation of a possible causal relationship between the pulmonary diagnosis and workplace or other exposures, and second, assessing the severity of symptoms and physical findings (so called non-key factors) to further refine the impairment rating that is established on the basis of "key" objective factors such as results of pulmonary function tests and cardiopulmonary exercise tests.</p><p>The basic components of a pulmonary evaluation include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A complete medical history outlining the onset and pattern of symptoms and, in particular, a description and quantification of the patient's respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, and wheezing. The medical history should also document coexisting medical conditions, medications, and allergies. An impairment classification scheme has been developed to classify dyspnea on a qualitative scale from mild to very severe  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94780" href="/d/graphic/94780.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A comprehensive employment history outlining all jobs, specific toxic exposures, intensity, duration, frequency of exposure, the nature of ventilation and use of personal protective equipment, and prevalence of disease in fellow employees.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A description of the temporal relationship between exposures and the onset and duration of symptoms. Particular attention should be given to whether symptoms are markedly improved during periods away from work (eg, days off, weekends, vacations).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification of nonoccupational exposures that may contribute to the patient's clinical presentation, such as smoking, pets, hobbies.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Documentation of any previous evaluation and treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Performance of a thorough physical examination, with concentration on the respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and central nervous systems and also identification of physical signs of impairment and dysfunction (eg, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, crackles or wheezing, signs of cor pulmonale). </p><p></p><p>The history and physical examination do not always contribute to the quantification of the degree of impairment. However, they provide supportive evidence for establishing the correct diagnosis and defining possible work-related and non-work-related factors. In addition, clinical signs of cor pulmonale or pulmonary hypertension are sufficient criteria for a severe impairment rating according to the AMA guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are considered the "key" measures of pulmonary impairment:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Forced vital capacity (FVC)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)</p><p></p><p>The spirometry and diffusing capacity studies should be performed in accordance with the ATS/European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards [<a href="#rid7">7,9</a>]. Normal values for spirometry and single breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (also known as carbon monoxide transfer factor [TLCO] in Europe and elsewhere) are based upon height, age, and sex [<a href="#rid7">7,9,21,22</a>]. Spirometry also incorporates adjustments in predicted values according to race and ethnicity given that correlations between social class, race and ethnicity, and spirometry have also been observed [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. More recently, with the increased awareness about the ways in which such adjustments may perpetuate health disparities and structural racism, their use has come into question, particularly when it comes to such issues as adjudication of impairment ratings in workers compensation and employability for certain jobs [<a href="#rid25">25-33</a>]. Indeed, based on a statistical re-examination of the NHANES III (1988 to 1994) data, investigators found no statistical justification (evidence of effect modification), for race/ethnic-specific reference equations [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Hence, with the current reference standards for the United States population, several studies have suggested that no adjustments are necessary among individuals of European, Mexican, or African descent living in the United States [<a href="#rid21">21,34,35</a>]. These findings have further fueled the point of view that removing racial/ethnic adjustments (that typically have found lower reference values in certain racial/ethnic groups), reduces the potential for underestimating the severity of disease and impairment for these individuals. As stated above, using the same reference values potentially has both treatment and compensation consequences (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6969.html" rel="external">"Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6971.html" rel="external">"Selecting reference values for pulmonary function tests"</a>). Nonetheless, at the current time, many jurisdictions continue to incorporate some adjustment factor for race and ethnicity either using equations or a simple correction factor; for example, the state of Colorado Disability Board suggests multiplying the standard predicted values by 0.9 [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The ATS/ERS guidelines have recommended that in any case a statement should be made as to whether or not a correction factor was applied [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>The results of FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC form the basis of the objective assessment of pulmonary disability. As an example, an FVC between 45 and 50 percent of predicted or an FEV<sub>1</sub> below 45 percent of predicted correspond with severe impairment. The FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC values associated with milder degrees of impairment are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94780" href="/d/graphic/94780.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p>DLCO is a noninvasive measurement of gas exchange and is particularly useful when considering possible interstitial lung disease or emphysema. It is relatively insensitive compared with more direct measurements of gas exchange, such as arterial blood gases. A DLCO below 45 percent of predicted correlates with severe impairment in the AMA classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94780" href="/d/graphic/94780.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6972.html" rel="external">"Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide"</a>.)</p><p>In addition to FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and DLCO, other pulmonary function tests that are not required by the AMA guidelines may be helpful to the examining clinician's understanding of the patient's disability. Lung volume measurement can provide information beyond simple spirometry for patients with a suspected restrictive pattern, hyperinflation, or a mixed restrictive/obstructive pattern, while bronchodilator and bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing help inform the evaluation of suspected asthma. Diseases for which lung volume measurement often provides information beyond spirometry include sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial lung diseases, pneumoconiosis, and emphysema. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The pattern of a low FVC and low DLCO with relative preservation or increase in the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio is suggestive of a restrictive pattern. However, further evaluation with lung volumes, such as residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC), and/or total lung capacity (TLC), is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Significant hyperinflation, as seen with emphysema, will not be detected with simple spirometry, so measurement of lung volumes (eg, TLC, RV, FRC) and calculation of RV/TLC are needed to identify and confirm hyperinflation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mixed obstructive and restrictive patterns, as sometimes seen with lung disorders such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pneumoconiosis, are difficult to determine on the basis of spirometry alone. Full PFTs, including lung volume measurements, are important to evaluate the relative contributions of obstructive and non-obstructive components.</p><p></p><p>Bronchodilator reversibility testing is an essential component of the evaluation and diagnosis of asthma and COPD, and the postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> is a key objective parameter in the impairment rating for asthma  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95322" href="/d/graphic/95322.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Thus, for patients with a prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;80 percent of predicted, the effect of administration of inhaled bronchodilator should be assessed with postbronchodilator spirometry.</p><p>Tests of nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (as measured with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9622" href="/d/drug information/9622.html" rel="external">methacholine</a>, histamine, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9587" href="/d/drug information/9587.html" rel="external">mannitol</a> challenge tests) are reserved for evaluation of impairment in individuals with normal baseline spirometry and a suspicion of asthma or reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/525.html" rel="external">"Bronchoprovocation testing"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/550.html" rel="external">"Occupational asthma: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/536.html" rel="external">"Irritant-induced asthma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Exercise tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise testing is not part of the routine evaluation of pulmonary impairment. There are special circumstances, however, in which exercise testing is helpful [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient's symptoms of dyspnea are greater than abnormalities on spirometry or the diffusing capacity would indicate</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient reports inability to perform specific job duties due to breathlessness</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Submaximal or incorrect performance of spirometry or diffusing capacity is suspected</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impairment due to interstitial lung disease (at the discretion of the evaluator) </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, exercise testing is not necessary when severe impairment is found on the basis of spirometry and DLCO. In addition, there are medical contraindications to exercise testing, such as severe heart disease or arrhythmias, and physical limitations that may preclude accurate testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1433.html" rel="external">"Exercise physiology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3465.html" rel="external">"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p>Results from exercise testing are expressed as the maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> max) or as metabolic equivalents (METs), which reflect the maximum workload achievable by the patient. Data obtained from exercise capacity testing should be interpreted by a clinician with expertise in exercise physiology, because the results will be affected by a patient's effort, metabolic state, level of conditioning, and also underlying cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, neuromuscular, or orthopedic disorders.</p><p>Specific values for VO<sub>2</sub> max and METs are correlated with levels of impairment in the AMA guide for permanent impairment due to pulmonary dysfunction  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94780" href="/d/graphic/94780.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. A VO<sub>2</sub> max of less than 15 mL/kg per min is suggestive of severe impairment. However, this classification is not absolute and should be considered in the context of additional information, such as the patient's level of general conditioning and other possible contributing diseases. A guide to oxygen consumption and energy expenditure for different levels of work intensity is provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95166" href="/d/graphic/95166.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). </p><p>A general empiric rule has been that a person should be able to work eight hours a day at his or her job if it does not require more than 40 percent of the VO<sub>2</sub> max achieved during exercise capacity testing. In other words, one needs to have some knowledge of what the actual energy or metabolic requirements are for specific jobs to assess whether an individual is capable of performing that job based on the VO<sub>2</sub> max  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95166" href="/d/graphic/95166.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Again, this should only be considered as a general guideline, since there are often extenuating circumstances that may make direct application of this rule inappropriate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Arterial blood gases</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arterial blood gases, aside from being invasive, are also difficult to standardize and interpret, since they may be affected by such factors as altitude. Nonetheless, in individuals whose degree of breathlessness is not explainable on the basis of spirometry or when the DLCO is between 40 and 60 percent predicted and in whom exercise testing is contraindicated or not available, documentation of the resting arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is recommended. According to the AMA guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], hypoxemia must be documented on two separate occasions at least four weeks apart.

The "Key Factors" for determining impairment are considered to be the objective assessments obtained by pulmonary function testing at a time of clinical stability. The patient's percent predicted values for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) are used to determine the initial impairment classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94780" href="/d/graphic/94780.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). As needed, the values for maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> max) or metabolic equivalents (METs) obtained from exercise testing are used.

The guidelines specify that a patient must be deemed to have reached their MMI before a final impairment rating is calculated [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In occupational asthma related to a sensitizer, this can require up to two years after removal from exposure [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Improvement may occur simply with the passage of time after there is evidence of a plateau in the patient's clinical condition, but this should not influence determination of MMI. Clearly, there are differences in the duration of time it takes a patient to reach MMI that are influenced by the nature of the condition and by individual variation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC CONDITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines contain a series of pulmonary disorders that require special consideration.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Asthma is a common cause of pulmonary disability. It is estimated that 38 percent of patients with asthma who are currently employed have partial work disability, while 14 percent of working-age adults with severe asthma have complete work disability [<a href="#rid38">38-40</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/543.html" rel="external">"Asthma in adolescents and adults: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>In asthma, spirometry results can be highly variable and dependent upon the adequacy of treatment with anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator medications. Thus, the AMA has developed criteria for the assessment of asthma that incorporate the postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9622" href="/d/drug information/9622.html" rel="external">methacholine</a>/histamine PC20)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95322" href="/d/graphic/95322.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Impairment classes (0 to 4) for asthma are based upon total score values. Total impairment/disability (class 4) is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite maximum treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids and/or oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> and typically characterized by a postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> below 50 percent predicted. It is important to note that there will be individuals who will meet criteria on the basis of medication requirement but have an FEV<sub>1</sub> better than 50 percent of predicted on medication.</p><p>Minimum medication requirements provide another criterion for assessment of patients with asthma. These requirements should be evaluated during a patient's period of clinical stability with minimum symptoms and optimum lung function. It should also be documented that reduction in medications below this level leads to exacerbations of symptoms and reduced lung function.</p><p>The clinician has some discretion in deciding whether the impairment rating may overestimate or underestimate impairment. Individual confounding factors include compliance with treatment, environmental control measures, and coexisting diseases (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease or rhinosinusitis) or habits (eg, cigarette smoking).</p><p>In the case of occupational asthma, it is important to state whether the disease is felt to be an immunologic or non-immunologic (irritant) type of asthma, since management may be somewhat different. A workshop report from the American Thoracic Society highlighted that certain compounds such as quaternary ammonia compounds can act as sensitizers and/or irritants or simply aggravate underlying asthma. It provides a robust discussion of ways to distinguish the nature of the bronchial reactions by physiological and immunological assessments [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. The workshop also discussed occupational COPD due to exposure to vapors, gases, dusts and fumes (VGDF) as an underrecognized and undercompensated condition.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with immune-mediated occupational asthma (with latency) due to a recognized sensitizer in the workplace should be removed from all further exposure, since even trivial level exposures can lead to significant morbidity and even death.
