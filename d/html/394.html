However, it can induce anaphylaxis on rare occasions. This topic reviews the frequency, risk factors, and clinical features of systemic reactions to allergen injections, including fatal and near-fatal reactions. Strategies for management and prevention of anaphylaxis due to SCIT are also discussed.</p><p>The indications for SCIT, the treatment of anaphylaxis, and fatal anaphylaxis due to many different causes are discussed separately. Systemic reactions to sublingual immunotherapy are also reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/361.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: Indications and efficacy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/392.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/390.html" rel="external">"Fatal anaphylaxis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SCIT was introduced in the early 1900s. As early as 1916, systemic reactions were reported to occur with 3.5 percent of subcutaneous grass pollen injections [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In 1986, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in the United Kingdom reported 26 SCIT-related anaphylactic deaths over a 10-year period [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This report led to adoption of a mandatory two-hour postinjection waiting period in the United Kingdom. This was difficult to implement and essentially eliminated the use of SCIT for years until a one-hour standard observation period became accepted practice. A 30-minute postinjection observation period is recommended in the United States [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">FREQUENCY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The frequency of systemic reactions may vary according to type of allergens, potency of the injected allergens, mode of allergen preparation and modification, and dosing protocols (eg, accelerated cluster or rush build-up regimens compared with regimens with weekly build-up) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Systemic allergic reactions (all severities)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following studies provide estimates of the frequency of systemic reactions with different types of SCIT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systemic reaction rate of 0.025 to 0.4 percent of injection visits affecting 7 percent of treated patients was reported in two studies of SCIT with aqueous unmodified allergens using conventional build-up regimens with multiple allergens [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. Most reactions were mild (generalized pruritus and urticaria only).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Results from a small, randomized trial suggest that the rate of systemic reactions may be lower with chemically modified extracts [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, in two studies of SCIT with a limited number of allergens and using alum-adsorbed extracts, systemic reactions of varying severity occurred with approximately 0.1 percent of all injections and in 5 percent of treated patients, comparable with rates in North America where aqueous extracts predominate [<a href="#rid7">7,9,10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reported systemic reaction rates were higher (4 percent of injections and in approximately 39 percent of treated patients) in earlier studies evaluating accelerated dosing regimens for aeroallergen SCIT, although severe anaphylactic reactions were still uncommon [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. A retrospective study employing pretreatment (H1 antihistamine, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9539" href="/d/drug information/9539.html" rel="external">montelukast</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>) noted a lower systemic reaction rate of 0.06 percent for an accelerated cluster regimen, and 0.33 percent for a rush regimen, compared with 0.1 percent with a standard regimen [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The risks and advantages of accelerated immunotherapy are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13526.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous aeroallergen immunotherapy: Accelerated schedules (cluster and rush)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Fatal and near-fatal reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fatal or near-fatal anaphylaxis after SCIT injections is a rare event.</p><p>Several retrospective surveys of fatal reactions and one survey of near-fatal reactions have assessed the frequency and nature of life-threatening anaphylaxis related to SCIT as practiced in North America [<a href="#rid14">14-19</a>]. Members of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) were contacted about occurrence of fatal reactions in their practices and indirect knowledge of such events occurring in other community practices. Responders reporting anaphylactic events were requested to complete a questionnaire regarding clinical manifestations of fatal reactions and near-fatal reactions, contributing factors, and subsequent management of anaphylactic reactions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H881829315"><span class="h3">Fatal reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fatal reactions have mostly occurred in adults, although there were consistently one or two children with fatal reactions reported in most surveys. Rates of fatalities range from one death in 2 million to one in 7.2 million injections:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Between 1985 to 1989, fatal reactions were estimated to occur once in every 2 million injections [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] and, from 1990 to 2001, once in every 2.5 million injections [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Between 2008 and 2018, fatal SCIT reactions were estimated to occur once in 7.2 million injection visits [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1770354309"><span class="h3">Near-fatal reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Near-fatal reactions involve respiratory failure or hypotension and correspond to World Allergy Organization (WAO) grade 4 reactions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85944" href="/d/graphic/85944.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Between 1990 and 2001, near-fatal reactions were reported at a rate of five per year or once every 1 million injections [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. These data may underestimate or overestimate true incidences because of a low responder rate (approximately 25 percent), as well as potential inaccuracies in recall reporting and lack of verification of events occurring in other community practices.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systemic reactions can occur in either the build-up or maintenance phases of immunotherapy, but in one large survey, the majority of near-fatal reactions and fatal reactions occurred during the maintenance phase (58 and 59 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is some preliminary evidence that certain allergens may be more likely to induce severe systemic reactions or near-fatal reactions than others. In a multicenter Danish study of 1038 patients receiving monotherapy with alum-adsorbed extracts, Timothy grass pollen was the only allergen to induce severe (grade 3 and 4) systemic reactions, and this was noted at the highest allergen doses [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Web-based surveillance for anaphylaxis to SCIT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An annual web-based surveillance project (North American SCIT Fatality and Systemic Reaction Surveillance Project) cosponsored by AAAAI and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology was initiated in 2008. It was intended to improve survey response rates and to track anaphylactic reactions with SCIT [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The survey captures data to estimate annual fatal reactions and mean and median numbers of SCIT injections administered, as well as frequencies of mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), and severe (grade 3) nonfatal systemic reactions. Participants were also asked if there were any fatal reactions due to SCIT or skin testing in their practice and if they had heard of any in the surrounding communities.</p><p>Data captured in the first 10 years (2008 to 2018) include the following [<a href="#rid7">7,19,22-24</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systemic reactions occurred in 1 per 1000 injection visits and most are mild. On average, there were 6.7 grade 1 systemic reactions, 2.9 grade 2, and 0.4 grade 3 systemic reactions per 10,000 injection visits [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In year 3 of the survey, 72 percent of clinical practices reported mild (grade 1) systemic reactions, 57 percent experienced moderate (grade 2) systemic reactions, and 14 percent reported severe (grade 3) systemic reactions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67718" href="/d/graphic/67718.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The frequencies of mild, moderate, and severe reactions per injections visits were very consistent year to year from 2008 to 2011.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A total of 10 fatal reactions were reported in the United States from 2008 to 2018 [<a href="#rid7">7,19,24</a>]. This includes three fatal reactions reported between 2008 and 2016 in association with an estimated 54 million injections. From 2016 to 2018, an additional seven fatal reactions were reported, suggesting an unexplained increase in SCIT-related fatal reactions [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe systemic reactions (grade 3) represented 3 to 4 percent of all reported systemic reactions over the first three years of the SCIT surveillance study [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Late-onset reactions beginning more than 30 minutes after injections accounted for 14 percent of all reported systemic reactions in year 2 of the SCIT safety surveillance study. Although 12.5 percent of severe reactions began after 30 minutes, all were managed successfully [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. This was confirmed during years 7 to 8, in which 15 percent of all systemic reactions began after 30 minutes. However, only 4.8 percent of the delayed-onset systemic reactions were graded as grade 3 or 4 in severity by the WAO criteria [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical practices that experienced severe anaphylaxis were significantly more likely to use a higher dose range of house dust mite extract (1000 to 1999 allergen units) when compared with practices experiencing only mild systemic reactions to allergen injections [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Practices that always adjusted maintenance doses of injections during peak pollen seasons were significantly less likely to report grade 3 or 4 systemic reactions [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Practices that tracked the observation time after SCIT injections and required patients to check out with office personnel had significantly lower rates of systemic allergic reactions compared with those using other post-injection monitoring strategies [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Accelerated rush build-up regimens were associated with more grade 1 and grade 2 systemic reactions than slow build-up regimens [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Specific cluster build-up protocols with premedication may have comparable rates of systemic reactions as slow build-up [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. There was no association with grade 3 or 4 reactions, but too few of these occurred to assess.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prior history of a SCIT-related systemic reaction was reported among 26 percent of all patients experiencing a systemic reaction of any severity. In those patients with SCIT-related anaphylaxis, 34 percent had experienced a prior systemic reaction to SCIT [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Signs and symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Systemic allergic reactions to SCIT range from cutaneous manifestations (pruritus, urticaria, or angioedema at locations other than the site of the injection) to anaphylaxis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82831" href="/d/graphic/82831.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The World Allergy Organization has issued a grading system for classifying clinical severity of systemic reactions to SCIT specifically  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85944" href="/d/graphic/85944.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3621472153"><span class="h2">Life-threatening reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Life-threatening anaphylaxis after SCIT injections is characterized by severe bronchospasm with acute respiratory failure and/or hemodynamic compromise manifested by profound hypotension and associated symptoms (syncope, collapse). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/390.html" rel="external">"Fatal anaphylaxis"</a>.)</p><p>Similarities and differences in clinical presentations of fatal reactions and near-fatal reactions were apparent from clinical data collected in two American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology-sponsored surveys  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52921" href="/d/graphic/52921.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypotension was a common feature reported in greater than 80 percent of fatal reactions and near-fatal reactions. Shock, syncope, or cardiac dysrhythmia occurred in 69 percent of fatal events reported in a prior fatality survey [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cutaneous manifestations (urticaria, angioedema, and pruritus) occurred at a much higher frequency in near-fatal reactions (70 percent) than in fatal reactions (29 percent). Absence of skin manifestations may result in delayed recognition and treatment of fatal reactions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper airway obstruction (eg, angioedema) and bronchospasm were reported with similar frequencies in fatal reactions and near-fatal reactions. However, acute respiratory failure was identified in 94 percent of fatal reactions, compared with 10 percent of near-fatal reactions. This difference probably reflects the higher prevalence of uncontrolled asthma documented among patients with fatal reactions. All patients with fatal reactions and near-fatal reactions who developed respiratory failure were previously diagnosed with asthma. Over one-half of patients with near-fatal reactions who required intubation had preinjection forced expiratory volume in one second values &lt;70 percent of predicted [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are a number of reports indicating that one-half to two-thirds of all systemic reactions due to SCIT start within 30 minutes from the time of injection [<a href="#rid5">5,10,28-30</a>]. Late reactions may be overestimated in the later reports, as the North American SCIT Fatality and Systemic Reaction Surveillance Project estimated that approximately 85 percent of systemic reactions begin within in the first 30 minutes [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The remainder starts within six hours from the time of the injection.</p><p>Examination of the most serious reactions reveals that 96 percent of near-fatal reactions and 90 percent of fatal reactions began within 30 minutes after allergen injections in the North American surveys [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. Thus, about 10 percent of fatal reactions were reported to have started 30 to 60 minutes after injections [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>].</p><p>In one report, late reactions beginning after 30 minutes occurred more frequently among patients with asthma receiving injections of multiple allergens [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Consistent predisposing factors have not been identified.</p><p>Biphasic reactions can occur. In prospective studies, 10 to 23 percent of anaphylactic reactions to SCIT were biphasic [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. The second phase of these reactions was mild and did not require treatment with additional <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>. In one of the studies, low baseline peak expiratory flow and concomitant asthma were associated with biphasic anaphylaxis [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH FATAL AND NEAR-FATAL ANAPHYLAXIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians reporting fatal reactions and near-fatal reactions were queried about factors they believed contributed to risk for these events as part of three retrospective fatality surveys. A summary of responses combined from two studies is shown in the table and reviewed below  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53298" href="/d/graphic/53298.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. In one of the surveys, clinician responders could not identify an explanation or contributing factor in 17 percent of fatal SCIT reactions [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Asthma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pre-existing diagnosis of asthma was more frequent among patients with fatal reactions (88 percent) compared with those with near-fatal reactions (46 percent) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In addition, indicators of uncontrolled asthma were more common among patients with fatal reactions compared with near-fatal reactions, including reports of poor asthma control, labile asthma, prior emergency room visits, and prior hospitalization  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54017" href="/d/graphic/54017.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Four of seven SCIT-related fatalities occurring between 2008 and 2017 were in patients with asthma [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Data from the 2021 North American survey indicated that 50 percent (105 of 209) of reported grade 3 or 4 nonfatal anaphylactic systemic allergic reactions occurred in patients with severe asthma [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The majority of patients with baseline forced expiratory volume in one second &lt;70 percent of predicted experienced worsening bronchospasm after allergen injections in a prospective study of rush SCIT with a standardized <em>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</em> extract, demonstrating that severe airway obstruction is a risk factor for systemic reactions with SCIT [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Prior systemic allergic reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who had systemic reactions to SCIT were more likely to have experienced prior large local reactions or previous injection-related systemic reactions [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

Thus, there are several areas of uncertainty regarding best practices for managing pollen-allergic patients receiving SCIT during peak seasons.</p><p>Published data on the issue of dose adjustments for peak pollen seasons are limited, and clinicians differ in their approach. Several variables may be involved. In parts of the world where pollen exposure occurs year round, it may not be necessary to reduce the dose of the related aeroallergen during peak season, whereas this may be important in areas where pollen seasons begin more suddenly. In addition, the individual patient's sensitivity to pollen and whether or not the patient has concomitant asthma or past history of anaphylaxis to immunotherapy should be considered.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is the author's practice to make adjustments to SCIT in response to peak pollen seasons on an individual basis.
