Despite the importance of postpartum perineal care, there is little evidence to guide management; the information in this topic is based largely on our clinical experience. </p><p>In our experience, common postpartum perineal issues include pain control, hygiene, prevention of constipation, and resumption of sexual activity. Clinicians should be able to evaluate less common symptoms, such as severe pain, bulge or mass, or abnormal discharge, including urinary and/or fecal leakage.</p><p>Related topics that are presented separately include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5399.html" rel="external">"Repair of perineal lacerations associated with childbirth"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3270.html" rel="external">"Delayed surgical management of the disrupted anal sphincter"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8086.html" rel="external">"Fecal and anal incontinence associated with pregnancy and childbirth: Counseling, evaluation, and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transmasculine and gender diverse individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1591426401"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians often refer to the area between the vagina and anus as the "perineum"; however, anatomically, the perineum is the entirety of the pelvic outlet inferior to the pelvic floor  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74060" href="/z/d/graphic/74060.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The area between the vagina and anus is more aptly termed "the perineal body." The anatomy of the perineum is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14185.html" rel="external">"Surgical female pelvic anatomy: Uterus and related structures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14186.html" rel="external">"Surgical female urogenital anatomy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14186.html" rel="external">"Surgical female urogenital anatomy", section on 'Perineum'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1376809788"><span class="h1">INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We take the following approach to perineal care for all individuals undergoing vaginal delivery.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2839569635"><span class="h2">Education</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, preliminary education about postpartum care is begun during prenatal visits to help patients understand typical changes that will occur during childbirth and recovery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Once postpartum, we educate each patient about the nature of her perineal laceration or incision (ie, episiotomy), if any; measures for hygiene and comfort; predicted outcomes; and warning signs. We discuss that perineal pain and swelling are common for the first 7 to 10 days, and then typically improve. The duration of symptoms vary for each person and are impacted by clinical circumstances. For example, second-degree obstetric lacerations or episiotomies typically heal by the third postpartum week; those with third- or fourth-degree lacerations may require four to six weeks. Education and appropriate reassurance, in the absence of concerning symptoms, are important in this period. Ensuring patients are given the opportunity to ask questions in a safe and supportive medical environment is essential, and many patients will benefit from simply having reassurance provided during this time frame.</p><p>Concerns specific to the perineal area that are frequently raised by patients include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fear of suture removal</strong> – We educate patients that the perineal sutures are generally self-absorbing and that no further procedures are usually needed (although in some settings permanent sutures that require subsequent removal may be used). We use this opportunity to educate the patient about the location and types of sutures, whether or not the sutures dissolve, and what can be anticipated if suture removal is required at a future date. The goals of education are to inform the patient as well as reduce potential anxiety and distress. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fear of bowel movement</strong> – Understandably, many patients are afraid that passing a bowel movement will damage the repair, be exquisitely painful, or both. We address this concern with information on pain management and prevention of constipation. (See <a class="local">'Constipation prevention'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fear of sexual activity</strong> – Many patients are concerned that the changes to the vaginal introitus will be a problem. These concerns may be that the introitus is permanently narrowed or that the vagina is too wide and gaping. Patients and/or their partners may fear that vaginal intercourse will be difficult or painful after obstetric laceration or episiotomy repair. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We discuss that this fear is extremely common and reassure them that despite the initial pain, edema, and bruising they may experience following birth, these changes typically heal well. Addressing that having a vaginal birth may impact a couple's perception of the area is also important. We discuss that they should be able to resume vaginal sexual function by approximately six to eight weeks postpartum (depending on the status of the perineum). Individuals who are unable to resume predelivery sexual activity by three months postpartum should be evaluated. For patients who need subsequent evaluation, assessment should include physical, emotional, and relationship considerations. (See <a class="local">'Resumption of sexual activity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fear of vaginal discharge</strong> – We discuss that lochia is normal after vaginal or cesarean birth. Patients who had a vaginal birth or who pushed prior to undergoing cesarean delivery may also experience incontinence (urine and/or feces), but these should be self-limited. These and other routine postpartum changes are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6711.html" rel="external">"Overview of the postpartum period: Normal physiology and routine maternal care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4052399030"><span class="h2">Hygiene</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following vaginal delivery, menstrual pads, squirt bottles, and sitz baths are commonly recommended for perineal care. There are no data to guide sequence or duration of these interventions. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Menstrual pads </strong>– We and others advise use of unscented menstrual pads that are changed frequently when soiled [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. We suggest avoiding use of tampons or a menstrual cup for at least six weeks to limit risk of infection and allow perineal healing, although supporting data are lacking.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cold packs</strong> – Cold packs made of ice or other cold source can be placed on top of the menstrual pad. We advise patients to apply ice to the perineum for 24 hours, with warm water soaks to start thereafter. This approach can be modified based on the individual's feedback; if ice feels better, then the patient continues with ice packs for an additional 24 hours prior to initiating warm water soaks. In addition, some patients find both ice packs and sitz baths helpful and alternate treatments.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Squirt bottle for perineal care and urination</strong> – The squirt bottle is used to irrigate the perineum with warm water during urination, which can help reduce external dysuria, stinging, or discomfort. We advise patients to spray the perineum while urinating for as long as it improves comfort. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sitz bath for perineal care and pain reduction</strong> – A sitz bath, a warm shallow bath that bathes the perineum and buttocks, is commonly used to clean the perineum and to reduce pain and swelling, although data are limited. For sitz baths, we recommend each episode be of approximately five minutes in duration, for a frequency of four times daily, or after any bowel movement (particularly emphasized in patients who have had anal sphincter lacerations). We instruct patients to ensure that the vaginal and rectal areas, including any sutures, are fully placed in the water. Of note, there are conflicting data on the optimal water temperature for pain reduction; those who find cold water more soothing are encouraged to use it [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Some clinicians advise adding Epsom salt (one-half cup salt to 1 gallon water) to the bath, although at least one study did not report a difference in perineal pain with its use [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. We do not routinely recommend this, due to lack of evidence for efficacy. As it does not appear to be harmful, it can be done based on provider or patient preference.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H415906962"><span class="h2">Pain management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Comfort measures include topical treatments (eg, cold or warm packs), topical anesthetics, and oral analgesics. The choice of treatments is chosen on an individual basis and generally initiated in a stepwise approach [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. As there are data associating perineal pain with postpartum depressive symptoms, efforts should be made to keep patients reasonably comfortable and ongoing or atypical pain should be evaluated [<a href="#rid2">2,7</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Topical treatments</strong> –<strong> </strong>Topical treatments available to reduce perineal pain include ice packs or other cooling agents and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10319" href="/z/d/drug information/10319.html" rel="external">witch hazel</a> pads (ie, hamamelis water). We suggest applying crushed ice to the painful perineal area for 10 to 20 minutes at a time as needed. We recommend using an ice pack or bag of crushed ice and then wrapping it in a cloth such as a hand towel. Direct ice (ice or crushed ice in a plastic bag without wrapping) applied to the skin for longer periods has not been studied and may actually be harmful. In a meta-analysis of 10 trials comparing localized cooling treatments with no treatment or other forms of treatment (eg, gel pads with compression, witch hazel, warm baths), self-reported individuals treated with ice packs reported decreased pain at 24 to 72 hours after birth compared with no treatment (risk ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.91, one study) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. No impact on healing was reported. In a subsequent trial of 50 self-reported individuals with perineal pain following episiotomy, those treated with crushed ice to the perineum for 20 minutes reported improved pain relief compared with those who received routine care [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There was a direct correlation between the temperature reduction in the affected tissue and the pain relief experienced. As an alternate to crushed ice, frozen menstrual pads provide a convenient and less messy form of cryotherapy. These can be presoaked in water and then frozen to provide longer lasting cooling. Two subsequent trials reported reductions in postpartum pain scores, compared with usual care, after application of cold gel packs to the perineum for 10 to 20 minutes, which was sustained for up to two hours in one of the trials [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10319" href="/z/d/drug information/10319.html" rel="external">witch hazel</a> pads are often advised for perineal pain reduction. However, no trials comparing them with placebo are currently available. As they do not appear to be harmful, they can be combined with other treatments as desired.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Topical anesthetics</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9092" href="/z/d/drug information/9092.html" rel="external">Benzocaine</a> spray is often offered to patients after vaginal birth to reduce perineal pain, although a meta-analysis of eight trials reported no difference in pain relief with other topical anesthetics (not including benzocaine) compared with placebo [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Additional limitations of this meta-analysis included short follow-up and limited assessment of patient satisfaction. One advantage of benzocaine spray is that it does not require touch for application. Some brands also contain skin moisturizers (aloe and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="101844" href="/z/d/drug information/101844.html" rel="external">lanolin</a>) and menthol, which creates a cooling sensation. We have found topical benzocaine spray helpful in reducing perineal discomfort, including the stinging sensation associated with perineal stretching, even if no laceration occurred. Anecdotally, benzocaine spray, used as needed, appears to reduce the discomfort associated with hemorrhoids as well. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Oral analgesics</strong> –<strong> </strong>Oral analgesics most commonly used include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. For patients with extensive vaginal or periurethral lacerations, underlying chronic pain syndromes, or obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS), pain regimens that include short-term opioid analgesia can be required to achieve pain relief. While all are compatible with breastfeeding, they do cross over into breast milk. Additional information on medication and lactation is available <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fbooks%2FNBK501922%2F&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT%2BqOtddW%2Fy3%2BLj0shalBW%2BL1ZyL4trystKLNkAhaR%2FcduMJFFebszM73aaFBm717nqYa%2FpVDsg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=111631" target="_blank">online</a>. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>NSAIDs are our first choice for perineal pain relief, unless an individual has a specific contraindication. In a meta-analysis of 28 trials comparing NSAID (13 different agents) with either placebo or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> for early postpartum perineal pain, adequate pain relief at four hours was nearly twice as likely with the NSAID compared with placebo and nearly 50 percent more likely for the NSAID compared with acetaminophen [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Individuals treated with an NSAID were also less likely to need additional pain medication at four and six hours compared with those who received placebo. Maternal adverse effects were minor (eg, dizziness, headache, moderate epigastralgia) and not different from placebo treatment. Neonatal adverse effects were not studied. We suggest oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> 600 mg every six hours as needed for pain relief during the first postpartum week. The maximum recommended dose of ibuprofen for individuals with normal renal function is 2400 mg in 24 hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7993.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults", section on 'Issues in the therapeutic use of NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">Acetaminophen</a> is our second-line agent for perineal pain relief based on the above meta-analysis and a different meta-analysis demonstrating improved pain relief with acetaminophen compared with placebo [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. We suggest 650 mg every 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 3250 mg per 24 hours, for pain beyond that controlled with the scheduled <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> (ie, we prescribe acetaminophen in addition to the ibuprofen for those who require additional pain relief). While there are no direct comparisons of the dose effect for postpartum perineal discomfort, adequate analgesic effect has been demonstrated with the 500 to 650 mg dose [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7993.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults", section on 'Issues in the therapeutic use of NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> is our third-line agent for postpartum perineal pain based on a meta-analysis of 17 trials including over 1100 self-reported individuals that found a single dose of aspirin, compared with placebo, reduced perineal pain for individuals with episiotomy [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. As breastfeeding persons were not included in the trials, the impact of aspirin on lactation or the neonate could not be assessed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Opioid analgesics are rarely needed and should be prescribed only if the patient has not achieved adequate pain relief with the above topical and oral treatments [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. When opioids are used, we prescribe no more than seven days of non-extended release medications. Patients whose pain is inadequately controlled or worsening should undergo further evaluation to assess for infection or other causes of heightened pain. Patients are counseled about the risk of worsened constipation with opioid treatment, which could worsen perineal pain, and drowsiness. The potential risks of addiction, crossover into breast milk, and infant sedations are reviewed as well, although these risks are reduced with short-duration treatment. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Herbal and complementary therapies</strong> – Additional treatment options for perineal pain include therapeutic ultrasound and plant-based ointments. In a meta-analysis of four trials comparing ultrasound, with or without pulsed electromagnetic therapy, with placebo, there was insufficient evidence to support use of ultrasound [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In a different trial, use of topical <em>Achillea millefolium</em> (ie, arrowroot, yarrow, or yarrow root) or <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> (ie, St. John's wort) ointments was associated with decreased perineal postpartum pain. However, more data are needed on efficacy and safety before routinely prescribing these agents as other proven options are available [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Skin glue for wound closure</strong> – Two small studies comparing surgical glue with suture for closure of obstetric lacerations reported reduced pain and similar complication rates with glue use [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1283923079"><span class="h2">Constipation prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Constipation during pregnancy and postpartum is common and is believed to result from smooth muscle relaxation caused by progesterone and other hormones [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Postpartum, this effect may continue for days to weeks. Following delivery, we treat to optimize stool consistency. Maintaining soft bowel movements that can be passed without straining helps avoid pain with defecation and prevent disruption of perineal and rectal sutures. The bowel movements should not be liquid or too loose, however, as this can increase risk of fecal incontinence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/407.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Gastrointestinal tract"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/407.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Gastrointestinal tract", section on 'Bowel, rectum, anus'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supporting data</strong> – The optimal treatment is not known. General recommendations for postpartum constipation prevention typically include eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of water, but these may not be adequate in the postpartum setting. Additional treatment options include fiber supplements, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. A meta-analysis of five trials including 1208 postpartum persons compared postpartum laxative use with either placebo or laxative and fiber bulking agent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. None of the trials included any educational or behavioral interventions and the only trial that included a stool-bulking agent was focused on patients with OASIS [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Laxative use decreased time to bowel movement and increased frequency of bowel movements, but also increased frequency of diarrhea and fecal incontinence [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The four trials comparing laxative with placebo did not assess pain with defecation or straining with bowel movements, but the trial that compared laxative with laxative plus fiber bulking agent reported no difference in pain on defecation. Impact of constipation on surgical repair breakdown rates is not known.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Step-wise approach</strong> – In discussing constipation prevention with postpartum patients, prepregnancy and antenatal bowel habits are reviewed. For example, we inquire about any prior diarrhea-prone irritable bowel symptoms or other gastrointestinal disorders. In the absence of clinical evidence to guide care and in the absence of underlying gastrointestinal disease, we recommend treating routine postpartum individuals with scheduled doses of an oral bulk forming laxative (fiber), and then progress through a step-wise treatment plan until the patient is able to pass a soft bowel movement every two to three days  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59746" href="/z/d/graphic/59746.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). We allow two to three days to determine if a treatment is effective or if the next agent in the list needs to be added. We typically advocate continuing the prior medications and adding the next agent in the list, rather than discontinuing the prior agent and moving on to the next. The order of agents is driven in part by the ease of use by the patient. Historically, scheduled stool softeners (commercial name Colace) have been utilized as a first-line intervention to prevent constipation in this patient population. This is a surfactant agent, which lowers the surface tension of stool and allows water to enter more easily. There is little evidence to support the use of this, and a systematic review suggested it was less effective than fiber supplement [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. A detailed review of these treatments is presented separately.

While patients who have not sustained a third- or fourth-degree laceration are candidates for rectal suppositories or enemas if desired, we typically do not recommend them, mainly because they are uncomfortable to use. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1245689639"><span class="h2">Resumption of sexual activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the postpartum resumption of predelivery sexual activity. Generally accepted criteria for resuming predelivery sexual activity include a fully healed perineum, emotional readiness, and use of contraception, if indicated. We suggest that nothing be placed in the vagina for six weeks; by six weeks postpartum, lochia and vaginal discharge have typically ceased, perineal lacerations have healed, and sutures have resorbed. The postpartum visit typically occurs within the first six weeks and allows evaluation of the perineum and discussion of contraception needs. </p><p>Additional counseling at the visit should also include recommendations regarding use of lubricant during intercourse and timing regarding follow-up if unable to resume predelivery sexual activity (ie, evaluation at three months). For patients who are lactating and have bothersome vaginal dryness, vaginal estrogen may be helpful. We usually prescribe estrogen cream 0.5 to 1 g intravaginally twice weekly for symptomatic patients and discuss this very low dose does not interfere with lactation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2784677019"><span class="h1">SYMPTOMS REQUIRING EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with any atypical perineal complaint, including severe pain, perineal bulge or mass, abnormal discharge (eg, green vaginal or rectal discharge) should have further evaluation, preferably on the same day if possible [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2465076105"><span class="h2">Severe pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals reporting severe, persisting, or worsening pain should be evaluated for infection, separation, and hematoma, or other less common complications. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3158626647"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Extreme or worsening pain, particularly if associated with fever or general malaise, often indicates infection. While perineal infections generally occur during the first week after delivery, individuals can present with symptoms two or three weeks later. Infection can be limited to the laceration or expand as cellulitis, an abscess, or, in extreme cases, necrotizing fasciitis [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. Infection or an abscess can track into the ischiorectal fossa and present as buttock pain. The obstetric laceration repair can be intact or disrupted by the infection. (See <a class="local">'Separation'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Patients with symptoms concerning for infection should undergo detailed, directed physical examination. Examination findings suggestive of perineal infection include erythema of the surrounding skin, shiny or tense skin, drainage, visible disruption of prior repair, and edema. Any patient with a concern for perineal infection should undergo examination for concern of rectal involvement, including evaluation for foreign bodies in the rectum or fistulae. We advise that patients with these findings undergo perineal exploration, possible debridement, and possible abscess drainage. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical setting for evaluation</strong> – We attempt to do as much as possible in the outpatient office setting to minimize disruption to parent-infant bonding. However, individuals with extreme pain may benefit from performing the examination with sedation or anesthesia (regional or general) as indicated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to confirmed infection</strong> – Once perineal infection is identified, we take the following approach:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Antibiotics</strong> – If there are signs of abscess or a soft-tissue infection, we initiate systemic oral antibiotics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110530.html" rel="external">"Acute cellulitis and erysipelas in adults: Treatment"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Abscess</strong> – If an abscess is identified, we open the repair and drain the abscess. In an office setting, opening and drainage are preceded by adequate local anesthesia (topical or injectable). Following removal of a portion of the sutures, the abscess cavity should be thoroughly irrigated. Some patients with a bulging abscess may tolerate having the sutures cut and the abscess drained without local anesthesia because abscess drainage releases the pressure that was causing the pain. Patients whose abscess is successfully drained may then consider the risks and benefits of allowing healing by secondary intention or undergoing a staged repair. Factors to be considered include the extent of the required healing, cosmesis, potential for future poor healing and pain, and patient goals. Discussions of immediate and delayed repair are presented in related content. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5399.html" rel="external">"Repair of perineal lacerations associated with childbirth", section on 'Secondary repair of episiotomy breakdown'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Deep infection</strong> – If the infection appears to be in the deeper portion of a repair, an incision into the surrounding tissues, drainage, tissue debridement, and packing can be indicated. For small abscesses, this can either be performed in the office or in the operating room. For larger abscesses or if there are any concerns about the depth/extent of infection, we prefer to incise and drain the repair in an operating room where appropriate analgesia/anesthesia options and instruments are available and adequate exploration can be achieved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Necrotizing infection</strong> – We evaluate patients who appear systemically ill and have evidence of deep tissue infection for necrotizing deep tissue infections. If there is a significant concern for possible necrotizing infection and imaging is not rapidly available, proceeding directly to the operating room for surgical exploration is the prudent and recommended course of action as a delay in treatment of this rare but life-threatening complication can be catastrophic for the patient. If imaging can be done expeditiously, we find that images can provide additional information regarding the extent of tissue involvement, help identify the amount of debridement that may be necessary, and indicate the potential need for additional surgical assistance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">"Necrotizing soft tissue infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108059.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of necrotizing soft tissue infections"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2913498372"><span class="h3">Separation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Separation of a repaired perineal laceration or episiotomy, also described as breakdown or dehiscence, refers to the disruption of a sutured repair. The separation can be partial or complete. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology and risk factors</strong> – Although separation can occur in the absence of infection, infection is more commonly present. Patients who present with wound separation without evidence of infection may have had forced sexual activity. Individuals at highest risk of a separation are those who have sustained a third- or fourth-degree laceration. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing and clinical presentation</strong> – Studies suggest that 10 to 14 days following vaginal delivery is the peak time for separation [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Patients with separation typically present with increased pain or burning, with abnormal discharge, or, less commonly, after experiencing a "popping" sensation. Resumption of intercourse while the repair is still healing can also increase risk of separation. Screening for nonconsensual sexual activity should be considered in this patient population.</p><p></p><p>For those with separation and infection, the repair is further opened, rectovaginal examination is performed to exclude rectal involvement, and the patient is managed as described above until the infection has resolved (see <a class="local">'Infection'</a> above). For individuals with separation but no infection, we take the following approach:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>First- or second-degree lacerations</strong> – Patients with separation of first- or second-degree lacerations can be managed expectantly, to heal by secondary intention, or have the open laceration repaired. As the limited available data suggest equal outcomes, we discuss the risks and benefits of each and elicit the individual's preference in choosing the management plan. Some people prefer to heal by secondary intention because this approach avoids the stress of surgical debridement and secondary repair. Others prefer to have the laceration closed directly. In our clinical experience, most patients with first- or second-degree perineal injuries do well with expectant management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5399.html" rel="external">"Repair of perineal lacerations associated with childbirth"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5399.html" rel="external">"Repair of perineal lacerations associated with childbirth", section on 'Secondary repair of episiotomy breakdown'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Comparison of suturing versus secondary intention</strong> – In a meta-analysis of two trials totaling 52 self-reported women that compared secondary suturing with non-suturing, there was no difference in healing at four weeks or dyspareunia rates at two and six months [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Although more individuals in the suturing group had resumed intercourse by two months, there was no difference at six months. No data on pain or patient satisfaction were reported. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Timing of healing with secondary intention</strong> – One review of 55 self-reports from females with perineal dehiscence (all types of obstetric lacerations) observed that wounds took an average of 3 weeks to heal and nearly 70 percent healed in ≤4 weeks [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Third- or fourth-degree lacerations</strong> – Patients with separation of third- or fourth-degree laceration repairs are typically treated with antibiotics, undergo operative tissue debridement until healthy tissue is present, and then receive a secondary repair. We believe this approach minimizes the risk of fistula formation and increases the likelihood of a successful repair, although supporting data are limited, particularly around choice of antibiotics. We typically use a first-generation cephalosporin unless there is evidence that more broad coverage is required (eg, large volume of fecal contamination of laceration). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5399.html" rel="external">"Repair of perineal lacerations associated with childbirth", section on 'Secondary repair of episiotomy breakdown'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Aseptic technique during the initial repair is key to prevent subsequent separation. In one trial, application of povidone-iodine powder to the perineum during episiotomy repair was associated with decreased incidence of separation in the treated group compared with the standard care group (separation rates 3.5 versus 13.5 percent) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Although the body of evidence is limited, the 2007 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines as well as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend using aseptic techniques during perineal repair [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. Unless a contraindication exists, we routinely use liquid betadine or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/z/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> with a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> irrigation to cleanse the perineum prior to suturing. In the event of an allergy to these agents, we recommend use of baby shampoo mixed with water or saline irrigation. Repair of obstetric lacerations or episiotomy is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5399.html" rel="external">"Repair of perineal lacerations associated with childbirth"</a>.)</p><p>Granulation tissue often appears pink or reddened, with a tissue overgrowth or papillary appearance; granulation tissue can develop in the area of perineal repair, which should not be confused with an infection or breakdown. Expectant observation is generally sufficient, unless the granulation tissue is painful, bleeding, or otherwise bothersome to the patient. We treat symptomatic granulation tissues with either application of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9888" href="/z/d/drug information/9888.html" rel="external">silver nitrate</a> (small areas) or simple excision in the office.

These can be diagnosed during physical examination. Briefly, hemorrhoids appear as purplish masses protruding from the anus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78700" href="/z/d/graphic/78700.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72916" href="/z/d/graphic/72916.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). Hemorrhoids are typically treated with conservative management, but thrombosed hemorrhoids can require incision and drainage due to significant discomfort associated with them. In uterovaginal prolapse, the cervix or vaginal wall is visualized in the lower half of the vaginal canal or protruding out of the vagina  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64451" href="/z/d/graphic/64451.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). </p><p>Individuals with prolapse can be fit with a pessary to provide support and reduce any associated pelvic ache or burning. Such prolapse will usually improve as they recover from the delivery, although they may be at higher likelihood of later development of pelvic floor support defects. These patients can also be advised to do Kegel exercises and/or referred for pelvic floor physical therapy after perineal healing is complete. </p><p>Presenting symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these entities is discussed in detail in the following topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2541.html" rel="external">"Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1382.html" rel="external">"Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6715.html" rel="external">"Management of hematomas incurred as a result of obstetric delivery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8072.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3928907578"><span class="h3">Hematoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postpartum hematomas, particularly of the vagina and vulva, can expand rapidly and be exquisitely painful.

While these somewhat vague descriptions may result in the evaluation of individuals who are healing appropriately, we believe fewer people with complications are missed with this approach.

Topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> jelly can be applied to the perineum to reduce examination-related discomfort. Superficial inspection of the labia and perineum can identify erythema suggestive of infection, a distal abscess, or superficial cellulitis. For individuals with symptoms or examination findings concerning for abscess, hematoma, or separation, digital vaginal examination is performed with a single examination finger to minimize patient discomfort. If a speculum examination is indicated, we use the smallest speculum that provides adequate visualization and separate the speculum to use only the posterior blade to retract the obstructing tissue. Rectal examination is performed to exclude foreign body (eg, sutures) or fistula. </p><p>If the patient is unable to tolerate the examination, we proceed with an examination under anesthesia.

Patients who may benefit from weekly visits include those with medical risk factors for poor wound healing (eg, those with diabetes, immunosuppression, other comorbidities, or smokers), individuals with extensive repairs, and individuals who find perineal care challenging (eg, limited social support or intellectual capabilities).

Episiotomy did not increase the risk of postpartum dyspareunia relative to same degree of spontaneous laceration [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Factors associated with increased risk of postpartum dyspareunia include operative vaginal delivery (both forceps and vacuum) and third- and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations [<a href="#rid33">33-36</a>]. Perineal pain is associated with depressive symptoms, in addition to negatively impacting quality of life and sexual activity [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4478.html" rel="external">"Approach to episiotomy", section on 'Mediolateral versus median (midline) episiotomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4474.html" rel="external">"Assisted (operative) vaginal birth"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114776.html" rel="external">"Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Although supporting data are limited, initial treatment options include topical estrogen therapy and pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT). For patients with dyspareunia and hypoestrogenism, typically related to breastfeeding, the authors prescribe topical estrogen cream, 1 gram twice weekly applied to the vagina and perineum, without a ramp-up period [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Individuals with persistent perineal pain or dyspareunia at three months postpartum may benefit from PFMT for symptom reduction, although the data are conflicting [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>]. We do not universally request early referrals for PFMT in postpartum individuals to reduce the likelihood of development of postpartum pain or dyspareunia. If these symptoms are reported following their six week postpartum visit, we will offer a referral for PFMT at that time [<a href="#rid38">38-40</a>].</p><p>For individuals with refractory perineal pain or dyspareunia who have not responded to PFMT, referral to a specialist for discussion of revision perineoplasty is a treatment option. In a study of nine postpartum women with persistent perineal dyspareunia and anatomic distortion (ie, scarring), there was a significant reduction in perineal pain and increase in coital frequency and satisfaction following perineal revision [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. However, as repeat surgery can also increase scarring and resultant pain, revision perineoplasty is often reserved for individuals with persistent, bothersome symptoms that are isolated to the obstetric scar, or those with persistent bothersome granuloma. Such patients may benefit from referral to a female pelvic medicine specialist (ie, urogynecologist) for their revision perineoplasty.</p><p>While transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and therapeutic ultrasound therapy have been used to treat postpartum perineal pain and dyspareunia, we do not prescribe them as the body of evidence is limited. One small trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy reported decreased dyspareunia with treatment, but no control group was included for comparison [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. In a meta-analysis of four trials comparing therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, women in two trials were more likely to report perineal pain reduction with treatment and women in one trial were less likely to report dyspareunia [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, because no other measured outcomes reached significance and the overall quality of the trials was variable, the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess therapeutic ultrasound as a treatment for postpartum perineal pain or dyspareunia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2072775406"><span class="h2">Incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the available data are limited, we suggest postpartum PFMT for individuals with incontinence (urinary or anal) and/or pelvic organ prolapse that remains symptomatic three months after delivery. PFMT appears to improve postpartum urinary and anal incontinence symptoms at 1 year, but not in the long-term (6 to 12 years) [<a href="#rid38">38,39,43</a>]. PFMT has been demonstrated to improve pelvic organ prolapse severity and symptoms in older individuals, although the impact on persons who are immediately postpartum is not known [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. We routinely recommend Kegel exercises to postpartum people who have symptoms of either incontinence or prolapse, although do not recommend it universally to asymptomatic individuals. During pelvic examination, it is helpful to assess muscular strength and ensure appropriate Kegel performance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H497092764"><span class="h2">Poorly healed perineum</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients will present months after delivery with bothersome perineal anatomic changes or defects despite having fully healed obstetric perineal lacerations. These may include an open (widened) introitus and thin perineal body, which typically result from detachment of the bulbocavernosus and superficial transverse perineal muscles. One trial comparing the impact of surgical correction with pelvic floor physical therapy for patients with residual symptoms following second-degree injuries reported greater improvement in all measured domains with surgical correction (71 versus 11 percent) [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Measurements of improvement included the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Thus, for patients who are at least six months from delivery with perineal symptoms relating to their prior obstetric laceration, the authors offer surgical correction, although patients who desire a trial of pelvic floor physical therapy may reasonably do so. The offer of surgical repair is balanced with counseling regarding timing of subsequent pregnancies. Surgical correction is not advised for patients who desire to conceive in the short term; repair is generally delayed until the completion of childbearing or possibly performed at the time of a subsequent delivery. If the patient is undecided or planning on a moderate to extended delay of childbearing, the authors will offer surgical correction. </p><p>The option of planned cesarean birth is discussed in related content on obstetric anal sphincter injury.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114776.html" rel="external">"Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS)", section on 'Approach to future delivery'</a>.)  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4477.html" rel="external">"Cesarean birth on patient request"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4126096432"><span class="h1">SPECIAL POPULATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1927990750"><span class="h2">Obstetric anal sphincter injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with an obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS; ie, a third- or fourth-degree obstetric laceration) appear to be at increased risk of infection and separation compared with those with lesser lacerations [<a href="#rid46">46-48</a>]. In a prospective cohort study of nearly 270 self-reported women, operative vaginal delivery was the main risk factor for separation following OASIS [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. As evidence-based interventions that prevent complications are not known, we advise frequent postpartum follow-up of individuals with OASIS to identify complications early and initiate treatment to reduce sequelae.

As the data are limited, the optimal strategies for these efforts are not known. (See <a class="local">'Initial approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>First- or second-degree perineal lacerations or episiotomy</strong> – These patients typically have one visit (in-person or virtual) during the first three weeks after delivery. We address any patient concerns and ask about healing, pain, and incontinence of urine and/or feces. Subsequent evaluation and specialty referral can be made as needed. (See <a class="local">'Post-discharge care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations</strong> – We advise more frequent follow-up for individuals with<sup> </sup>third-<sup> </sup>or fourth-degree obstetric lacerations to ensure early detection of any developing complications.
