Opportunistic diseases have become less common, and mortality has declined such that most treated patients with HIV now have a near-normal life expectancy [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. Most deaths in patients with HIV receiving ART are now related to conditions other than AIDS [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. HIV infection appears to increase the risk of non-AIDS-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, and malignancies [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. These and other common age-related diseases may occur more frequently and at a younger age than in uninfected persons [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. In addition, a variety of long-term complications mostly associated with older antiretroviral drugs has been described.</p><p>The emergence of non-AIDS-related conditions highlights the important role of the primary care clinician. Based on experience from other chronic medical conditions, general practitioners are well suited to oversee and coordinate a multidisciplinary approach to HIV care. One survey of 102 internal medicine physicians and 75 infectious diseases specialists found that generalists with extensive experience in HIV management provided high-quality care to these complex patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In the United States, there will be a future need for increased involvement of primary practitioners in HIV care given the growing prevalence of persons living with HIV [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>The role of the primary clinician in the care of the adult with HIV will be discussed here, with particular attention to clinical monitoring and health care maintenance. The initial evaluation of the adult with HIV is addressed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3741.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of adults with HIV"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H416514452"><span class="h1">GUIDELINES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America has published guidelines on the primary care of individuals with HIV, which were last updated in 2020 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The recommendations provided in this topic are generally consistent with these guidelines. </p><p>Links to recommendations by other expert groups, including the European AIDS Clinical Society [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], can be found in the society guideline links topic. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1381409040"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of a patient with HIV includes assessment of disease stage and evaluation for comorbidities, prior exposures, and risk factors in order to inform appropriate management. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3741.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of adults with HIV"</a>.)</p><p>Primary care clinicians need to understand that HIV-related stigma is common and associated with lost follow up, worse health outcomes, and lower quality of life [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. It is important that all clinic staff communicate in a nonjudgmental manner, use preferred words and phrases, and avoid stigmatizing language in order to increase patient comfort and build positive rapport.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1791711014"><span class="h1">FREQUENCY OF CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The appropriate frequency of medical visits for an adult with HIV depends on many factors, including the stage of HIV infection, the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the presence of other medical or social comorbidities and complications. As an example, frequent visits may be appropriate for patients who are recently diagnosed or newly linked to care. Frequent visits are also warranted after the initiation of ART to evaluate efficacy and tolerability. However, once the viral load has been suppressed and the CD4 cell count has normalized, less frequent monitoring is appropriate [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3770.html" rel="external">"Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are to prolong life and improve its quality, restore and preserve immunologic function (as measured by CD4 count), maximally and durably suppress the HIV viral load, and prevent HIV transmission [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Although cure of HIV infection is not achievable with current management approaches, ART has resulted in significant reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Such benefits have been reported even in patients with normal CD4 cell counts [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Thus, initiation of ART for all patients with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count, is recommended [<a href="#rid15">15,17</a>]. </p><p>Initiation, management, and monitoring the efficacy of ART are fundamental components in the care of the adult with HIV. Detailed discussion of these issues is found elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3777.html" rel="external">"When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3773.html" rel="external">"Selecting antiretroviral regimens for treatment-naïve persons with HIV-1: General approach"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13979.html" rel="external">"Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced patients with HIV who are failing therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3770.html" rel="external">"Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45"><span class="h1">MONITORING FOR COMPLICATIONS AND PREVENTIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients with HIV who are receiving effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), most deaths are now related to conditions other than AIDS [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Patients with HIV appear to have a higher risk of certain medical conditions, including metabolic complications and some malignancies, compared with the general population. These may be associated with HIV infection itself, risk factors prevalent in populations with HIV, or the use of ART. Optimal care of the patient with HIV requires knowledge about and evaluation for such potential complications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96776" href="/d/graphic/96776.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p>Routine preventive care is also important in the care of patients with HIV. Data from a large cohort collaborative, the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD), suggested that traditional risk factors (eg, smoking, hypertension) contributed more to the risk of myocardial infarction, non-AIDS-defining cancers, end-stage liver disease, and end-stage kidney disease than HIV-related risk factors (eg, CD4 count or HIV RNA level) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The analysis also suggested that primary prevention of traditional risk factors alone could decrease development of a large proportion of these diseases.</p><p>Preventive care in the general population is outlined elsewhere (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97819.html" rel="external">"Overview of preventive care in adults"</a>). The following subsections outline specific complications prevalent among populations with HIV.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1356106898"><span class="h2">Hematologic, renal, and hepatic toxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HIV has been associated with abnormalities of bone marrow, kidney, and liver function, either directly or secondary to comorbid conditions. Evaluation for such underlying abnormalities should be done at the initial presentation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3741.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of adults with HIV", section on 'General blood and urine testing'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who have not yet initiated ART, routine monitoring for these abnormalities is warranted, for example with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential every three to six months and a chemistry panel including blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, serum transaminases, and bilirubin level every 6 to 12 months [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>For patients who are on ART, monitoring is generally more frequent, particularly when ART is initiated, because of the potential for drug-associated toxicity. Specifically, in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends routine performance of the following basic laboratory tests [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CBC with differential every three to six months when monitoring CD4 count and every year once the CD4 count is no longer monitored. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3770.html" rel="external">"Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy", section on 'CD4 count'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basic chemistry, including BUN and creatinine, four to eight weeks following ART initiation and every six months thereafter.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urinalysis following ART initiation or change and every 12 months thereafter (or every six months while on a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9895" href="/d/drug information/9895.html" rel="external">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> [TDF]-containing regimen). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alanine and aspartate aminotransferases and total bilirubin four to eight weeks following ART initiation and every six months thereafter.</p><p></p><p>More frequent monitoring may be warranted in patients who have baseline abnormalities in hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function and with the use of certain agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3770.html" rel="external">"Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy", section on 'ART-associated toxicity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H416514900"><span class="h2">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With more effective and widespread treatment of HIV, cardiovascular disease has emerged as an important cause of death in patients with HIV relative to the decreasing incidence of opportunistic infections [<a href="#rid7">7,19</a>]. The degree to which HIV infection itself, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and ART (eg, protease inhibitors, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8993" href="/d/drug information/8993.html" rel="external">abacavir</a>) each contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the population with HIV is unknown. It is of paramount importance that clinicians identify and initiate appropriate preventive interventions for cardiovascular risk factors in patients with HIV. Assessment and management of cardiovascular risk and disease in adults with HIV are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3739.html" rel="external">"Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in patients with HIV"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3734.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in patients with HIV"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H46"><span class="h3">Dyslipidemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies have consistently shown a high prevalence of dyslipidemia among patients with HIV, with and without ART. Certain agents, such as earlier generation protease inhibitors, have been associated with a greater risk of unfavorable lipid changes. Thus, patients with HIV should undergo lipid testing routinely throughout care  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96776" href="/d/graphic/96776.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12,20,21</a>]. </p><p>Management of dyslipidemia consists of lifestyle modification, consideration of switching to a more "lipid-friendly" ART regimen if appropriate, and pharmacologic treatment with statins when appropriate for cardiovascular risk reduction. Standard cardiovascular risk calculators do not incorporate the presence of HIV infection. When starting lipid-lowering agents, it is important to be aware of potential drug-drug interactions. Depending upon the ART regimen, some drugs are contraindicated, and others should be administered in lower dosages initially with monitoring for drug toxicity. The use of lipid-lowering agents in persons with HIV is discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3734.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in patients with HIV"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3739.html" rel="external">"Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in patients with HIV"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H47"><span class="h3">Glucose intolerance/diabetes mellitus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Glucose intolerance/diabetes mellitus is another important toxicity associated with ART, especially with earlier generation protease inhibitors. Thus, patients with HIV should be screened for diabetes mellitus at baseline and after initiation of ART. </p><p>We agree with expert groups in the United States that recommend a blood glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) at baseline before starting ART. After ART has been initiated, serum glucose should be used to screen for diabetes mellitus annually [<a href="#rid12">12,15,20</a>]. Some experts also check glucose within one to three months of starting a new regimen [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Glycated hemoglobin should not be routinely used to diagnose diabetes mellitus after ART has been initiated as HbA1c may underestimate glycemia in patients with HIV. Fasting glucose &gt;125 mg/dL or abnormal glucose tolerance test can be used as alternatives in this setting.</p><p>Management of glucose intolerance/diabetes mellitus includes weight loss through diet and exercise and pharmacologic treatment with oral hypoglycemic drugs and/or insulin as needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3734.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in patients with HIV", section on 'Insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3739.html" rel="external">"Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in patients with HIV", section on 'Recognizing and managing diabetes mellitus'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1356107030"><span class="h3">Hypertension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with HIV may have higher rates of hypertension compared with uninfected patients [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. A blood pressure check should be performed at least annually [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Definition and management of hypertension in the patient with HIV are the same as those for the general population. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3852.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3734.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in patients with HIV", section on 'Hypertension'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1791711842"><span class="h3">Tobacco use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Smoking is common in patients with HIV and a major contributor to cardiovascular and lung cancer risk. One study from Denmark suggested that smokers with HIV lose more life-years to smoking than to HIV [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Another study suggested that smokers with HIV who are taking ART are much more likely to die from lung cancer than from AIDS-related conditions [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. All patients with HIV should be evaluated for ongoing cigarette smoking, and those who smoke should be advised of the benefits of quitting. Smoking cessation may be more difficult to achieve in this population [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3739.html" rel="external">"Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in patients with HIV", section on 'Smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2813745025"><span class="h2">Chronic lung disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis appear to be more common in persons with HIV compared with uninfected controls [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Some of these findings are likely related to the increased prevalence of smoking in this population.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H416515094"><span class="h2">Premature bone loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fracture rate have been reported in higher frequency in patients with HIV compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Some studies have suggested a possible link between ART (specifically, TDF and protease inhibitors) and bone loss [<a href="#rid28">28-30</a>].</p><p>Although supporting data are limited, baseline bone densitometry screening for osteoporosis in patients with HIV is recommended in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years of age or older [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. For those who do not have osteoporosis at baseline, repeat testing is the same as for patients without HIV and dependent on the extent of bone density loss, if any. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2046.html" rel="external">"Screening for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men", section on 'Follow-up to screening'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with osteoporosis or other risk factors for premature bone loss, TDF should be avoided since <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="110861" href="/d/drug information/110861.html" rel="external">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8993" href="/d/drug information/8993.html" rel="external">abacavir</a> are associated with smaller declines in bone mineral density [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In some patients, a two-drug regimen (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120975" href="/d/drug information/120975.html" rel="external">dolutegravir-lamivudine</a>) may be reasonable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129782.html" rel="external">"Selecting antiretroviral regimens for treatment-naive persons with HIV-1: Patients with comorbid conditions", section on 'Osteoporosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3766.html" rel="external">"Switching antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV-1 and a suppressed viral load", section on 'Eligibility for two-drug regimens'</a>.)</p><p>Management of osteoporosis includes ruling out secondary causes (eg, hypogonadism, vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and thyroid disease), initiating lifestyle changes (eg, increased physical activity, smoking cessation), calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonate therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3738.html" rel="external">"Bone and calcium disorders in patients with HIV"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1791711026"><span class="h2">Neuropsychiatric disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both psychiatric conditions and neurocognitive problems are common among adults with HIV. </p><p>Clinicians should screen patients annually for depression and anxiety using validated instruments (eg, PHQ-9, GAD-7) and inquire about ongoing substance abuse. Aggressive treatment of psychiatric comorbidities is important for the successful management of HIV infection. However, clinicians should be aware that psychological symptoms may also be manifestations of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).</p><p>Certain antiretroviral drugs (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8731" href="/d/drug information/8731.html" rel="external">efavirenz</a> and, occasionally, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16494" href="/d/drug information/16494.html" rel="external">rilpivirine</a> and integrase inhibitors) have been associated with adverse neuropsychiatric effects. Close monitoring is recommended for patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders who are on these agents [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In some cases, the regimen may need to be changed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3766.html" rel="external">"Switching antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV-1 and a suppressed viral load", section on 'Neuropsychiatric side effects'</a>.)</p><p>Assessing for the presence of symptoms of neurocognitive impairment can be performed during a clinical visit to identify patients who may be affected by HAND.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3770.html" rel="external">"Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring and managing other conditions</strong> – Patients with HIV appear to have a higher risk of certain medical conditions compared to the general population. These include cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco use, premature bone loss, neuropsychiatric disorders, certain malignancies (eg, lung, hepatic, anal, and cervical cancers), and coinfections (eg, sexually transmitted infections [STIs], viral hepatitis, tuberculosis). Some of these may be associated with HIV infection itself, risk factors prevalent in populations with HIV, and/or the use of ART. Optimal care of the patient with HIV requires knowledge about and evaluation for such potential complications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96776" href="/d/graphic/96776.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Monitoring for complications and preventive care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immunizations</strong> – Immunizations are an important part of preventive care for patients with HIV  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130" href="/d/graphic/62130.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Inactivated vaccines are generally safe and acceptable in individuals with HIV. Certain live vaccines have sufficient safety data and are thus appropriate if indicated for individuals with HIV and CD4 cell counts &gt;200 cells/microL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3706.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in persons with HIV"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient counseling</strong> – Behavioral risk reduction counseling is an important part of the management of patients with HIV. At each visit, practitioners should review the patient's understanding of HIV transmission and his/her sexual and drug-use activities. Other relevant counseling issues for patients with HIV may include food, pet, and travel safety.
