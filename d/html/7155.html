Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are often considered together, although folate deficiency has become less common in individuals who are living in developed countries and consuming a normal diet.</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss the treatment of these deficiencies, their causes and pathophysiology, and other causes of macrocytic anemia:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7154.html" rel="external">"Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7153.html" rel="external">"Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other macrocytic anemias</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7166.html" rel="external">"Macrocytosis/Macrocytic anemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3792687810"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vitamin B12 and folate are both water-soluble B vitamins required for formation of hematopoietic cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63827" href="/z/d/graphic/63827.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5367.html" rel="external">"Overview of water-soluble vitamins"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vitamin B12</strong> – Vitamin B12 is also called cobalamin (Cbl). It is present in foods derived from animal products. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7153.html" rel="external">"Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies", section on 'Dietary sources and RDI'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The endogenous forms include cobalamin and holotranscobalamin, which represent the active fraction of plasma cobalamin. The supplemental forms used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency include cyanocobalamin, which contains a cyanide (CN) group introduced during chemical synthesis, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8813" href="/z/d/drug information/8813.html" rel="external">hydroxocobalamin</a>. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cyanocobalamin is predominantly used in the United States, while <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8813" href="/z/d/drug information/8813.html" rel="external">hydroxocobalamin</a> is predominantly used in Europe; both are effective in treating vitamin B12 deficiency. The major difference between the two preparations is in the pharmacokinetics and dosing interval, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7154.html" rel="external">"Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies", section on 'Available therapeutic preparations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pernicious anemia</strong> – Pernicious anemia (PA) refers to vitamin B12 deficiency caused by autoantibodies that interfere with vitamin B12 absorption by targeting intrinsic factor (IF), gastric parietal cells, or both. At the time it was described, PA was associated with continuous worsening of symptoms and even death without an available treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Folate</strong> – Folate is also called vitamin B9. The terms "folate" and "folic acid" are sometimes used interchangeably. Technically, the vitamin is found in nature as a folate, while <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/z/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">folic acid</a> is the synthetic form used therapeutically; it is an oxidized, water-soluble form that does not exist in nature [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Dietary folates are also called folate polyglutamates [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Dietary folate is found in plant-based foods and fortified grains. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7153.html" rel="external">"Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies", section on 'Dietary sources and RDI'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Folinic acid (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9548" href="/z/d/drug information/9548.html" rel="external">leucovorin</a>, N5-formyl-tetrahydofolate [THF], 5-formylTHF) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) are naturally occurring forms of reduced folate [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The roles of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9302" href="/z/d/drug information/9302.html" rel="external">vitamin B12</a> and folates in this pathway are illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113389" href="/z/d/graphic/113389.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Folinic acid is typically used to prevent toxicities of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> and to potentiate cytotoxicity of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (FU) in chemotherapy regimens for colon cancer. This is because folinic acid is rapidly converted to the metabolically active form of folate required in cells (tetrahydrofolate) without the need for dihydrofolate reductase, which is inhibited by methotrexate. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/z/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">Folic acid</a>, folinic acid, and 5-MTHF are all effective in treating folate deficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid</strong> – Homocysteine is methylated to create methionine in a reaction that requires folate and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9302" href="/z/d/drug information/9302.html" rel="external">vitamin B12</a> (folate is a methyl donor)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118333" href="/z/d/graphic/118333.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). This is why both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies result in accumulation of homocysteine  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139892" href="/z/d/graphic/139892.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is converted to succinyl-CoA in a reaction that requires <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9302" href="/z/d/drug information/9302.html" rel="external">vitamin B12</a> but not folate. This is why vitamin B12 deficiency causes accumulation of MMA but folate deficiency does not. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Use of metabolite testing in diagnosis is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Metabolite testing (MMA and homocysteine)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Megaloblastic versus macrocytic anemia</strong> – Both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies cause megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is a term that refers to anemia in which the process of nucleic acid metabolism is impaired, resulting in nuclear-cytoplasmic dyssynchrony, reduced number of cell divisions in the bone marrow, and nuclear abnormalities in both myeloid and erythroid precursors  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113390" href="/z/d/graphic/113390.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The term megaloblastic should be confined to nucleated red blood cell (RBC) precursors when used to describe red blood cell morphology. Macrocytic anemia is purely a morphologic term that describes large RBCs in the peripheral blood and includes all anemias with a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Megaloblastic anemia is a specific subtype of macrocytic anemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7166.html" rel="external">"Macrocytosis/Macrocytic anemia", section on 'Megaloblastic anemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control in the United States maintains dietary fact sheets for <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fods.od.nih.gov%2Ffactsheets%2FVitaminB12-HealthProfessional%2F&amp;token=j2ubxphgqNrgutMNz2vi6DQjqszOJHINKBUo%2FYPguqk3ozkjG941yb6%2F5jpU6k%2Bdgo6Y7a4aqV72pPSjScEt0NrJMIOCjnfEu1m6k3jNIZU%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7155" target="_blank">vitamin B12</a> and <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fods.od.nih.gov%2Ffactsheets%2FFolate-HealthProfessional%2F&amp;token=Bq8cXX%2FXdCR5LFnCcgRnlU8GA%2BwHNsHuEoFfN0NpVHq3zv01f1BalqsF%2F6yxT%2BHZPLkMcu8kfrypg8%2Bc6UJVjI2VK0SyB6495afxnUG0GRg%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7155" target="_blank">folate</a> that discuss the amount of these vitamins in selected food sources as well as recommended intakes and populations at risk for deficiency. Additional information about dietary intake and absorption of these vitamins is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7153.html" rel="external">"Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies", section on 'Overview of intake and metabolism'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2721228465"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies is likely to vary among different populations and depending on the threshold used to define deficiency. Examples include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General population</strong> – In a 2016 series of 3324 patients with anemia in a general practice population in the Netherlands, 249 had macrocytosis [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Of these, there were 46 cases of vitamin B12 deficiency (1.4 percent of all anemic individuals; 18 percent of those with macrocytic anemia) and 16 cases of folate deficiency (0.5 percent of all anemic; 6 percent of macrocytic anemia). A 2014 examination of folate testing performed on outpatients in a single center in Boston, Massachusetts (United States) found folate deficiency in only 47 of 84,187 (0.06 percent); another 166 (0.2 percent) had low-normal values (3.0 to 3.9 ng/mL) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pernicious anemia (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9302" href="/z/d/drug information/9302.html" rel="external">vitamin B12</a> deficiency due to autoantibodies) (see <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above) is most common in White people from northern Europe; the incidence is lower in individuals with African or non-northern European ancestry.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older adults</strong> – Multiple studies of older adults have shown higher prevalences of vitamin B12 deficiency or insufficiency than in younger adults, with prevalences in older adults ranging from 5 to 14 percent [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hospitalized patients</strong> – In a 2015 report of hospitalized inpatients in Canada who had testing for vitamin B12 and folate levels, vitamin B12 deficiency was observed in 98 of 3154 (3.1 percent); an additional 425 individuals (13.5 percent) had vitamin B12 levels in the low normal range (138 to 221 pmol/L), the clinical manifestations of which are uncertain [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Folate deficiency (assessed using red blood cell folate) (see <a class="local">'RBC folate'</a> below) was observed in 4 of 2563 (0.16 percent). It should be noted that these prevalences apply to the subset of patients in whom testing was performed; the prevalences in all hospitalized patients is expected to be lower. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A report from Israel that measured serum folate in 726 patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine Department over a one-year period found 97 (13.4 percent) to be folate deficient [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. While the folate-deficient patients had higher in-hospital mortality than non-deficient patients (18.6 percent versus 12.1 percent), mortality did not differ between mild folate deficiency and severe folate deficiency, suggesting that deficiency occurred in the setting of underlying significant comorbidity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infants and young children</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Maternal B12 deficiency</strong> – Vitamin B12 deficiency is rare in infants but may be seen in newborns and breast-fed infants of vitamin B12-deficient mothers [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. This neonatal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9302" href="/z/d/drug information/9302.html" rel="external">vitamin B12</a> deficiency, if not identified and treated, can result in developmental delay or permanent neurologic damage [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Newborn screening programs evaluate for metabolic disorders including methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria and can also detect vitamin B12 deficiency in newborns. In the United States, the rate of nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency from 2003 to 2007 was reported to be 0.88 in 100,000 births (1 in 113,636) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, using more sensitive and specific second-tier testing in 176,702 infants in Germany, the rate of vitamin B12 deficiency was 1 in 5355 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In another study of 258,637 infants in Spain, screening identified 130 with acquired vitamin B12 deficiency (1 in 1989) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Lack of dietary folate</strong> – Folate deficiency may occur in a child unable to tolerate a normal diet or in severely malnourished infants or children. Deficiencies are also reported in infants drinking goats milk, which is deficient in folate [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5360.html" rel="external">"Micronutrient deficiencies associated with protein-energy malnutrition in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The prevalence of folate deficiency in healthy people with normal dietary intake has declined progressively in countries that have implemented routine <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/z/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">folic acid</a> supplementation of foods (including grains, breads, cereals, pastas and rice), which began in the late 1990s and early 2000s in many parts of the world [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The countries that use fortification of foods with folic acid are illustrated on a website from the Food Fortification Initiative [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This phenomenon is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the 2015 report from Canada that evaluated hospitalized patients for folate deficiency and found a prevalence of 0.16 percent, the only causes of folate deficiency were alcohol use, a malabsorption syndrome, decreased oral intake due to schizophrenia, and a spurious value [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Direct measurement of population folate levels in the NHANES study showed that after national fortification began, the mean serum folate level was 2.5 times higher than in the pre-fortification period, and red blood cell folate was 1.5 times higher [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency has remained stable over time. This is likely because most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency are due to decreased absorption rather than dietary lack; therefore, routine supplementation of vitamin B12 has not been implemented, and measurement of vitamin B12 status is indicated in the evaluation of anemia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1110320732"><span class="h1">ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many individuals with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency have an associated condition that predisposes them to one or more vitamin deficiencies. In some cases, these conditions may be known, and in others they may be appreciated in retrospect after the diagnosis of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency has been made.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9302" href="/z/d/drug information/9302.html" rel="external">Vitamin B12</a><strong> deficiency</strong> – Conditions that may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77437" href="/z/d/graphic/77437.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).
