In the United States, breast cancer is the most common female cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in women, and the main cause of death in women ages 40 to 49 years. The lifetime probability of developing invasive breast cancer is one in eight.</p><p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous, phenotypically diverse disease composed of several biologic subtypes that have distinct behavior. Amplification or overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<em>HER2</em>) oncogene is present in approximately 15 percent of primary invasive breast cancers [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Women with early-stage breast cancer that meet criteria for HER2 positivity are treated with chemotherapy and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/z/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a> as adjuvant treatment.</p><p>This topic review will cover the use of adjuvant HER2-directed therapy plus chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive, early-stage breast cancer (stage I to III).
