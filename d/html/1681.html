The most common causes of radiologically evident kidney cysts in adults are simple kidney cysts, which will be discussed in this topic review. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1680.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): Kidney manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1677.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): Treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Smaller cysts, usually &lt;1 cm in diameter, also occur in medullary sponge kidney, autosomal recessive PKD, and autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (previously called medullary cystic kidney disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7369.html" rel="external">"Medullary sponge kidney"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6138.html" rel="external">"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1685.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Other unusual causes of kidney cysts in adults are von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis complex, Fabry disease, and nephronophthisis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5193.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1684.html" rel="external">"Renal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex", section on 'Renal cysts'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7195.html" rel="external">"Fabry disease: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'When to suspect Fabry disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6136.html" rel="external">"Genetics and pathogenesis of nephronophthisis", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the kidney cyst classification system, our recommended approach to complex kidney cysts in adults, and a discussion of simple kidney cysts are presented in this topic review. The evaluation of a solid kidney mass is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2970.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1138454848"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1803188057"><span class="h2">Types of kidney cysts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Kidney cysts are categorized as simple or complex. Simple kidney cysts are commonly observed in normal kidneys, with an increasing incidence as individuals age [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] (see <a class="local">'Simple kidney cysts'</a> below). They are benign, asymptomatic lesions that rarely require treatment. By contrast, complex cysts may require follow-up imaging, biopsy, or surgical excision for diagnosis and management.</p><p>The primary clinical concern is accurately distinguishing simple kidney cysts from complex kidney cysts that are associated with an increased risk of malignancy. This increase in risk is primarily seen in categories III and IV in the Bosniak classification. (See <a class="local">'Bosniak classification of kidney cysts'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H436492675"><span class="h2">Bosniak classification of kidney cysts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Bosniak kidney cyst classification system was created to help diagnose and manage complex cysts [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In this schemata, simple cysts, which are at minimal risk for malignant transformation and do not require further evaluation, are classified as Bosniak category I. (See <a class="local">'Management according to Bosniak category'</a> below.)</p><p>The Bosniak classification of a kidney cyst is based upon specific morphologic and enhancement characteristics with unenhanced and intravenous (IV) contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). It should only be used for cystic lesions ≥1 cm in size since smaller cysts may appear to enhance due to volume averaging from adjacent normal kidney parenchyma. For cysts &lt;1 cm, ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for evaluation.</p><p>The five Bosniak categories (I, II, IIF, III, and IV) are associated with a risk of malignancy that starts from near zero (Bosniak I; simple cysts) and rises to over 85 percent (Bosniak IV). The Bosniak categories are detailed below  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67087" href="/d/graphic/67087.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Category I </strong>– A benign simple kidney cyst or multiple kidney cysts, each with a thin wall without septa, calcifications, or solid components. The cyst has the density of water and does not enhance. (See <a class="local">'Simple kidney cysts'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Category II</strong> – Benign cystic lesions in which there may be a few thin septa and the wall or septa may contain fine calcifications or a short segment of slightly thickened calcification. This category also includes uniformly high-attenuation lesions that are &lt;3 cm in diameter, well marginated, and nonenhancing  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100055" href="/d/graphic/100055.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Category IIF</strong> – Cysts in this category are generally well marginated and are more complicated than category II cysts but less complicated than category III cysts. They may have multiple thin septa or minimal smooth thickening of the septa or wall, which may contain calcification that may also be thick and nodular. They have no measurable contrast enhancement. However, these lesions may have subjectively perceived enhancement of the septa or wall when the unenhanced and contrast-enhanced images are compared. This category also includes totally intrarenal, nonenhancing, high-attenuating lesions that are &gt;3 cm in diameter. These cysts require follow-up to ascertain that they are not malignant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Category III</strong> – Cystic masses that have thickened irregular or smooth walls or septa. Measurable enhancement is present. Approximately 40 to 60 percent are malignant (cystic renal cell carcinoma and multiloculated cystic renal cell carcinoma) [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The remaining lesions are benign and include hemorrhagic cysts, chronic infected cysts, and multiloculated cystic nephroma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Category IV</strong> – Category IV lesions have all the characteristics of category III cysts, plus they contain enhancing soft-tissue components that are adjacent to and independent of the wall or septum  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77721" href="/d/graphic/77721.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Approximately 85 to 100 percent of category IV lesions have been reported to be malignant in various studies [<a href="#rid2">2,3,5,6</a>].</p><p></p><p>The presence of measurable contrast enhancement of the lesion is the most important characteristic separating categories III and IV (typically associated with malignancy in 40 to 100 percent of cases) from categories I, II, and IIF (typically benign) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Such contrast enhancement should be at least 10 to 15 Hounsfield units higher on contrast-enhanced images when compared with unenhanced images.</p><p>A 2019 version update of the Bosniak classification, endorsed by the Society of Abdominal Radiology, has been proposed [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This update includes quantitative definitions of the qualitative terms (eg, "thin" changed to "≤2 mm," "minimally thickened" changed to "3 mm") and descriptive modifications (eg, homogenous or heterogenous by Hounsfield units) to improve the specificity of higher-risk categories. The goal of this 2019 update was to improve the interreader agreement and cross-study consistency, and to decrease the proportion of benign masses that are unnecessarily resected. However, additional validation studies using this 2019 update are needed before it can be adopted into routine clinical practice. We continue to use the original Bosniak classification as discussed below until such validation studies become available. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1167749114"><span class="h1">SIMPLE KIDNEY CYSTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Simple kidney cysts are frequently observed in normal kidneys. They are the most common kidney masses, accounting for approximately 65 to 70 percent of cases [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The cysts may be solitary or multiple and bilateral [<a href="#rid5">5,8-10</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation of solid kidney masses and other noncystic kidney lesions is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2970.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116643.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the incidental kidney lesion"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H841200175"><span class="h2">Epidemiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of simple kidney cysts varies with the population studied and the imaging modality utilized. These cysts occur most often in patients &gt;50 years of age and are more common in males than females, as determined from postmortem examination, kidney ultrasonography, and/or abdominal CT scanning [<a href="#rid9">9,11-15</a>].</p><p>The following findings are illustrative:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A Japanese study of 14,314 individuals undergoing multiphasic health screening programs found at least one kidney cyst on ultrasonography in 12 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Cyst formation was twice as likely in males compared with females, and a sevenfold increase in prevalence was noted from the fourth to the eighth decade of life (5 to 36 percent). The majority of cysts increased in size over time, with the mean rate of growth being higher in patients &lt;50 years of age (3.9 versus 1.8 mm per year in older patients).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a series of 1948 potential kidney donors, a cortical, medullary, or parapelvic cyst ≥5 mm was detected by CT in 12, 14, and 2.8 percent of individuals, respectively [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The prevalence of cortical or medullary cysts was higher among donors aged 50 to 75 years compared with those aged 18 to 49 years (33 versus 12 for cortical cysts and 17 versus 12 percent for medullary cysts).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a report of 729 patients who underwent ultrasonography for reasons unrelated to the urinary tract, the incidence of at least one kidney cyst according to age and sex was [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>15 to 29 years of age – 0 (males) and 0 (females)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>30 to 49 years – 1.9 and 1.4 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>50 to 69 years – 15 and 7 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>≥70 years – 32 and 15 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bilateral cysts were much less common and were rare in subjects &lt;50 years of age</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H301042099"><span class="h2">Histopathology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Simple kidney cysts are oval or round in shape and of varying size, ranging from &lt;1 to &gt;10 cm [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The lining of the cyst is a single epithelial cell layer without kidney tissue elements. There is a clear to straw-colored fluid that resembles a plasma ultrafiltrate [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2268575195"><span class="h2">Clinical features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Simple kidney cysts may be solitary or multiple and bilateral [<a href="#rid5">5,8-10</a>]. They typically produce <strong>no symptoms or signs </strong>and as such are generally detected incidentally during radiographic studies performed for<strong> </strong>other reasons. The clinical significance of simple kidney cysts is not completely clear. Most nephrologists have believed simple kidney cysts to be of little significance. However, in a study cited above of 1948 healthy potential kidney donors, after adjusting for age and sex, cysts ≥5 mm were associated with higher albumin excretion, hypertension, and hyperfiltration [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. An association with hypertension has also been reported in other studies [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>] but not in a series of over 1000 patients in whom there was no increase in the incidence of hypertension, flank pain, hematuria, or proteinuria when compared with matched controls without cysts [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>Unless obstruction is present, simple kidney cysts do not compromise kidney function [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, limited evidence suggests that younger patients with simple kidney cysts may have mildly reduced (but still normal) kidney function [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Simple kidney cysts are rarely associated with rupture, hematuria, pain, abdominal mass, infection, and/or hypertension:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rupture of a simple kidney cyst can cause hematuria and/or flank pain. In one of the largest series of 25 patients with simple kidney cyst rupture, 21 had hematuria, and 17 had flank pain [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The cyst rupture was spontaneous in 21 patients and due to blunt abdominal or iatrogenic (during a procedure) trauma in four patients. Communication with the collecting system spontaneously closed in 11 patients and persisted in two patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infection of a simple kidney cyst is a rare cause of kidney abscess. The clinical features of an infected simple kidney cyst are the same as those of kidney abscess, which are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8057.html" rel="external">"Renal and perinephric abscess", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compression of the surrounding kidney parenchyma rarely causes angiotensin-dependent hypertension [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. In a retrospective review of 22 cases in the literature, removal or cyst aspiration cured or lowered the blood pressure in 15 and 2 patients, respectively [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The drop in blood pressure was closely related to reduced activity of the renin-angiotensin system in the involved kidney, which harbored a large cyst in all cases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Despite this observation, hypertension in patients with simple kidney cysts is most commonly due to factors independent of the cyst, such as essential hypertension. This is particularly true in older patients, in whom both simple kidney cysts and hypertension are common.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Simple kidney cysts rarely cause calyceal or renal pelvic obstruction [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H377370514"><span class="h2">Diagnosis of simple cysts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Simple kidney cysts have characteristic features on ultrasonography, CT, and MRI. Since most simple kidney cysts are asymptomatic, the initial imaging study that detects such a cyst is usually performed for unrelated reasons. If radiographic criteria for a benign simple kidney cyst are met, additional follow-up is not required. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1668592944"><span class="h3">Ultrasonography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three major criteria for a single simple kidney cyst on ultrasonography, which, if present, allow the cyst to be differentiated from a carcinoma or abscess [<a href="#rid5">5,26</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The mass is round and sharply demarcated with smooth walls.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There are no echoes (anechoic) within the mass.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is a strong posterior wall echo, indicating good transmission through the cyst and enhanced transmission beyond the cyst.</p><p></p><p>Further evaluation is <strong>not</strong> necessary if all of these criteria are satisfied, since the likelihood of malignancy is very low [<a href="#rid5">5,8,26</a>]. </p><p>Additional imaging should be performed if the ultrasonogram findings are not consistent with a simple cyst (eg, calcifications or septa are seen), if the study quality does not permit adequate evaluation of all criteria for a simple cyst, or if multiple kidney cysts are clustered in a pattern that could mask an underlying carcinoma. Abdominal CT obtained before and after the (intravenous) IV administration of radiocontrast media can classify the lesion into different categories that determine subsequent management. (See <a class="local">'Bosniak classification of kidney cysts'</a> above.)</p><p>The accuracy of ultrasonography in evaluating simple kidney cysts was illustrated in a retrospective study that assessed 260 lesions detected by IV urography in 242 patients [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The ultrasonographic diagnosis was confirmed by cyst puncture, surgery, or autopsy: 168 were "benign cysts" (ie, simple cysts), and all were diagnosed correctly by ultrasonography. The remaining 92 lesions were renal carcinomas, 90 of which were diagnosed correctly by ultrasonography. Retrospective analysis revealed that the two missed cancers did not meet all three ultrasonographic criteria for a simple cyst.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3075305747"><span class="h3">CT scan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To accurately characterize a cyst with CT scan, the CT images should be ≤5 mm in thickness and obtained before and after the IV administration of radiocontrast media.</p><p>A simple kidney cyst is considered to be present if the following findings are seen on CT scan [<a href="#rid2">2,3,5,6,26</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The cyst is sharply demarcated from the surrounding parenchyma and has a smooth, thin wall.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluid within the cyst is homogeneous, with a density of &lt;20 Hounsfield units (similar to water). However, higher values may be seen with a benign proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cyst.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is no enhancement following the administration of radiocontrast media, indicating the presence of an avascular lesion. Enhancement implies vascularity and is strongly suggestive of a malignant lesion, even in the absence of irregular margins.</p><p></p><p>Simple cysts diagnosed by CT require no further evaluation. Complex cysts are assigned to different categories based on specific CT findings; these categories are associated with varying risks of malignancy and inform further management.
