         Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in physical appearance, such that patients believe that they look abnormal, unattractive, ugly, or deformed, when in reality they look normal. The preoccupation with perceived flaws leads to repetitive behaviors (eg, checking their appearance in mirrors), which are difficult to control and are not pleasurable. BDD is common but usually underrecognized, causes clinically significant distress and/or impaired functioning, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with BDD may present to mental health professionals as well as other clinicians, such as dermatologists, plastic surgeons, primary care physicians, pediatricians, and dentists. Most patients seek nonpsychiatric cosmetic treatment (most commonly dermatologic and surgical) for their perceived physical defects; this treatment appears to be ineffective for most patients and can be risky for clinicians to provide. By contrast, pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or

          clomipramine
         </a>
         ) and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored specifically to BDD are often efficacious.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the clinical features of BDD. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, assessment, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of BDD are discussed separately:

         Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in physical appearance, such that individuals with BDD believe that they look abnormal, unattractive, ugly, or deformed, when in reality they look normal [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The preoccupation with perceived flaws leads to repetitive behaviors (eg, checking their appearance in mirrors), which are difficult to control and are not pleasurable. BDD causes clinically significant distress and/or impaired psychosocial functioning, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, BDD is often a severe illness. A study of inpatients with BDD (n = 16) and without BDD (n = 106) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], and a study of outpatients with (n = 16) and without BDD (n = 484) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], both found that clinical severity and functional impairment were greater in patients with BDD than patients without BDD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with BDD typically do not reveal their symptoms unless specifically asked [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]; patients are often embarrassed and ashamed, afraid of being misunderstood and negatively judged, and many are unaware that effective treatment is available [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Patients with BDD are preoccupied with nonexistent or slight defects in the physical appearance of one or more body parts [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,7-9
         </a>
         ]. The appearance preoccupations are difficult to resist or control, and occur for an average of three to eight hours a day [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. The body areas are perceived as unattractive, repulsive, abnormal, or deformed, and some patients describe themselves as looking like a freak, a monster, a burn victim, or the “Elephant Man.” The preoccupations with appearance are distressing in part because they focus on perceived unacceptability of oneself to others, and in many cases, involve an inaccurate belief that other people mock and reject the person because of how they look. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Social anxiety and avoidance'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients over the course of illness are preoccupied with the appearance of multiple body areas (average of five to seven different areas) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,11
         </a>
         ]. However, some patients are excessively preoccupied with just one body area, whereas others dislike virtually every aspect of their appearance. The most commonly disliked body parts are [

         </span>
         A core aspect of BDD is compulsions (rituals), which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that are driven by appearance preoccupations [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,11,14
         </a>
         ]. The belief that one looks unacceptable causes emotional distress (eg, anxiety, depressed mood, and shame). These negative feelings in turn fuel compulsive behaviors that are intended to reduce emotional distress by attempting to fix, hide, inspect, or obtain reassurance about the disliked body parts. These time-consuming behaviors are usually difficult to control and are not pleasurable. Most compulsions are motoric and observable by others, but mental rituals (eg, comparing) are common as well. These behaviors often increase rather than decrease anxiety and distress induced by the appearance concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
         All individuals with BDD perform repetitive behaviors at some point during the course of their illness. These behaviors may be clues that a person has BDD; patients who present with these behaviors should be assessed for BDD. The following compulsive behaviors are most common; all percentages are for lifetime (past and present) occurrence [

         <strong>
          Camouflaging
         </strong>
         – Approximately 90 percent of patients try to hide or cover up the disliked body areas. Camouflaging can include using a hat, heavy make-up, clothing, hair, sunglasses, or one’s hands. Approximately one-quarter of BDD patients excessively tan to darken “pale” skin, minimize perceived acne or wrinkles, camouflage areas such as a “bald spot” on the head, or diminish other BDD concerns. Many patients camouflage by positioning their body to make the disliked areas less visible to others. Camouflaging often involves repetitive, compulsive behavior, such as repeatedly applying makeup or frequently adjusting one’s clothing or body position. However, camouflaging is also avoidant in nature (ie, a safety behavior), in the sense that the goal is to avoid feeling the shame that occurs when the “flawed” body areas are seen by others.

         <strong>
          Comparing –
         </strong>
         Nearly 90 percent of patients frequently compare their disliked features with those of other people in their surroundings, as well as people in newspapers, magazines, online, or on television. This behavior can preoccupy patients so much that they have difficulty focusing upon conversations or tasks. In addition, comparing often increases distress because patients with BDD tend not only to underestimate their own attractiveness but also overestimate the attractiveness of others.

          –
         </strong>
         Nearly 90 percent of patients compulsively check their perceived defects in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces (eg, windows, backs of spoons, cell phones, and shiny appliances), often doing this for hours each day. While mirror checking, patients may perform other behaviors, such as excessive grooming or skin picking.

          Excessive grooming –

         More than half of patients excessively groom; patients may repeatedly style or comb their hair, repeatedly apply make-up, or pull or pluck their hair (eg, to remove “excessive” facial hair or to “even up” eyebrows or sideburns). However, hair pulling may be due to trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) rather than BDD; the differential diagnosis between BDD and trichotillomania is discussed separately. (See

          Seeking reassurance of others
         </strong>
         – Approximately half of patients frequently seek reassurance from others about how they look and whether they look acceptable. However, patients typically do not believe the reassurance they receive because they usually have little or no insight. (See

         <strong>
          Skin picking –
         </strong>
         More than one-third of patients compulsively pick their skin to try to make their skin look better (eg, smoother or completely blemish free). Some patients use sharp implements, such as pins, needles, razor blades, or knives. Injury to the skin, which can cause scarring and is occasionally life-threatening (due to infections or ruptured blood vessels), can occur. However, patients do not intend to injure or harm themselves. Thus, patients who pick their skin can be an exception to the rule that those with BDD do not have obvious appearance flaws. The differential diagnosis between skin picking (excoriation) disorder and BDD is discussed separately. (See

As an example, patients may frequently check online for ways to fix the perceived flaws, compulsively check their image on videoconferencing platforms, measure disliked body areas, take repeated selfies, scrutinize photos of themselves or others, touch disliked areas to examine them, or excessively wash their face or shower to prevent acne.

In addition, approximately 60 percent of patients have ideas or delusions of reference, believing that other people take special notice of the “defective” body areas, talk about the patient in a negative way because of appearance, or make fun of the patient’s physical appearance, all of which can contribute to social avoidance.

Many patients isolate themselves because they fear that other people will see the “deformity,” or fear rejection or ridicule because of their “ugliness.” Thus, some patients are housebound, and many avoid dating and physical intimacy.

         Muscle dysmorphia is a form of BDD that occurs almost exclusively in males and consists of an inaccurate belief that one’s body is too small, or should be more lean or muscular [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,20,21
         </a>
         ]. These patients look normal or even very muscular if they abuse androgenic steroids or work out excessively. Patients with muscle dysmorphia engage in multiple repetitive behaviors and are usually preoccupied with other body parts such as skin or hair. (See

         One review found that the prevalence of muscle dysmorphia among college students was approximately 6 percent, and that the condition was present mostly in males [

        <p>
         Most patients with muscle dysmorphia scrupulously diet (eg, eat high-protein, low-fat meals) and excessively exercise (eg, lift weights); the inordinate amount of exercise sometimes damages joints or muscles [

These individuals may use or misuse a large variety of nonprescription supplements as well as prescription drugs (usually obtaining them without a prescription), such as thyroid hormone, selective estrogen receptor modulators, androgenic steroids, and human growth hormone, with the goal of losing fat and building muscle. As an example, among men with muscle dysmorphia, approximately 20 to 40 percent abuse potentially dangerous androgenic steroids in an attempt to become bigger and more muscular [

         A prospective study enrolled patients who received rhinoplasty and followed them for five years; postoperative quality of life in the patients who screened positive for BDD (n = 5) did not improve and their mental health was worse [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         A survey of aesthetic surgeons included 178 who had operated on patients who were thought to be appropriate for surgery, only to realize afterwards that the patients had BDD. Poor outcomes occurred in 82 percent of the cases (patients were more preoccupied with the perceived defect, or were focused upon an imagined or slight defect in a different body part) [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Poor outcomes are perhaps to be expected, because BDD involves distorted body image, aberrations in visual processing, and a tendency to obsess about minimal or nonexistent flaws. Although a “surface” change such as that accomplished by surgery may provide temporary improvement in concerns about appearance, it is unlikely to treat the disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients with BDD who receive surgery and view the outcome as a failure, symptoms of BDD may worsen, and patients may become more preoccupied with their perceived defects and seek additional operative procedures or other interventions. In a retrospective study of 128 patients who were treated with cosmetic interventions, the average number of different treatments was three [

        </p>
        <p>
         The poor outcomes of cosmetic interventions may extend to clinicians in that dissatisfaction with treatment may lead patients to become litigious, threatening, or violent toward clinicians who administer the treatment [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>

Similarly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that individuals younger than age 18 years who request breast or labia surgery should be screened for BDD; if the obstetrician-gynecologist suspects that an adolescent has BDD, referral to a mental health clinician is appropriate [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36

         Among a subset of the patients (n = 141), only 42 percent were employed full time, 38 percent were unemployed, and 23 percent received disability pay [

         Many patients with BDD stop working, refuse to attend school, drop out of school, and avoid activities and other people because of beliefs they are ugly and because they don’t want to be seen [

          11

         ]. On average, occupational and social functioning was seriously impaired at baseline; during follow-up, functional remission (defined as no more than slight impairment in occupational and social functioning for two consecutive months) occurred in only 6 percent of patients. Poorer functioning was associated with more severe BDD symptoms, but not with delusional BDD beliefs.

         Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in physical appearance that lead to repetitive behaviors as well as clinically significant distress and/or functional impairment. However, patients typically do not reveal their symptoms unless specifically asked. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         </span>
         The preoccupation with appearance is difficult to resist or control, and occurs for an average of three to eight hours a day. Most patients over the course of illness are preoccupied with the appearance of multiple body areas, which are perceived as unattractive, repulsive, abnormal, or deformed. The most commonly disliked body parts are skin, hair, and nose. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Appearance preoccupations'

         A core aspect of BDD is compulsions (rituals), which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that are driven by appearance preoccupations. The compulsive behaviors are intended to fix, hide, inspect, or obtain reassurance about the disliked body parts. These behaviors usually take three to eight hours a day, are usually difficult to control, are not pleasurable, and often fail to relieve distress. Repetitive behaviors include camouflaging, comparing one’s disliked features with those of other people, mirror checking, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance from others, and skin picking. (See

          'Repetitive behaviors (compulsions and rituals)'

         BDD is typically characterized by either overvalued ideas (poor insight) or delusions, such that insight regarding the perceived appearance defects is usually poor or absent. (See

         Muscle dysmorphia is a form of BDD that occurs almost exclusively in males and consists of an inaccurate belief that one’s body is too small, or should be more lean or muscular. (See

         Most patients with BDD obtain dermatologic, surgical, or other cosmetic treatments in an attempt to “fix” their perceived appearance flaws. However, BDD symptoms appear to respond poorly to cosmetic procedures in the large majority of cases and may even worsen. (See
         <a class="local">

         Patients with BDD commonly manifest comorbid psychopathology, including unipolar major depression, social anxiety disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders. (See

         Suicidal behavior is common among individuals with BDD. In addition, the risk of suicidal behavior may be greater in those with BDD than other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety or depressive disorders. (See

         Other clinical manifestations of BDD include social anxiety and avoidance, emotional distress, neurocognitive dysfunction, emotional processing deficits, poor psychosocial functioning and quality of life, and hostile/aggressive behavior. (See
