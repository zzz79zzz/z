Mediastinal granuloma is characterized by a granulomatous mass-like lesion in the hilum or mediastinum. Fibrosing mediastinitis (also known as sclerosing mediastinitis or mediastinal fibrosis) is characterized by an excessive fibrotic reaction in the mediastinum. Both entities are uncommon complications of prior histoplasmosis infection. Involvement of mediastinal structures results in symptoms based upon the organs involved. Differentiating these two benign disorders from each other is important since the sequelae, potential interventions, and prognosis of both diseases are very different. </p><p>The etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of mediastinal granuloma and fibrosing mediastinitis are reviewed here. The presentation and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis and the approach to mediastinal masses are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2450.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2451.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6967.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is widely thought that fibrosing mediastinitis and mediastinal granuloma are two divergent host responses that occur in mediastinal lymph nodes from a previous infection (or insult). Most cases are thought to be due to previous infection with <em>Histoplasma capsulatum,</em> which is by far the most common cause in the United States. Infection with <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> is a less common cause. Cases due to other infections or noninfectious etiologies and idiopathic cases are rare in the United States. However, etiologies may be regionally dependent. For example, in a series of 27 patients from France with pulmonary hypertension due to fibrosing mediastinitis, almost one-half were due to sarcoidosis, one-third due to tuberculosis, and the remainder were due to mediastinal irradiation or were idiopathic [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. There were no cases of histoplasmosis. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141984"><span class="h2">Histoplasmosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among the etiologies, the dimorphic fungus, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, is by far the most common etiology for both disorders in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This is supported by the higher concentration of reported cases in endemic areas (eg, southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central United States along the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys) and the lower number of reported cases in other regions of the world where infection with <em>Histoplasma</em> is rare (eg, northeastern United States, Europe, and Asia) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Other infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mediastinal granuloma due to tuberculosis is well described and may be more commonly seen in patients who live or have previously lived in endemic areas (eg, West Africa, India) [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. </p><p>Tuberculosis is also often included as a potential precipitant of fibrosing mediastinitis, but it rarely stimulates an invasive fibrotic reaction similar to that seen following histoplasmosis [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Case reports have also described the development of fibrosing mediastinitis secondary to infection with <em>Aspergillus</em> [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>], <em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em> [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], <em>Blastomyces</em> [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], <em>Actinomyces</em>, and <em>Treponema</em> (syphilis) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. While these micro-organisms could also be associated with mediastinal granuloma, they may be more likely to cause active inflammation of mediastinal lymph nodes (ie mediastinal adenitis) rather than mediastinal granuloma. </p><p>Noteworthy is that coccidioidomycosis is rarely, if ever, associated with mediastinal granuloma or fibrosis. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3342102956"><span class="h2">Autoimmune</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several autoimmune disorders have been reported to be associated with fibrosing mediastinitis. Other than sarcoidosis, none of these autoimmune diseases has been described in association with mediastinal granuloma. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some cases of fibrosing mediastinitis occur within the spectrum of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related diseases, such as retroperitoneal fibrosis, orbital pseudotumor, Behçet disease, and Riedel's (fibrous) thyroiditis [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sarcoidosis has also been reported as a cause of fibrosing mediastinitis, particularly in Europe [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rare cases of mediastinal fibrosis have been described occurring in association with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and large-vessel arteritis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2071922882"><span class="h2">Miscellaneous</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Case reports have described the development of fibrosing mediastinitis due to mediastinal radiation [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>], methysergide, and silicosis [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. One case of mediastinal fibrosis has also been described in association with synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis-osteomyelitis (SAPHO) syndrome [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2696404019"><span class="h2">Idiopathic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most patients with mediastinal granuloma or fibrosing mediastinitis, a microorganism cannot be found. While in the past this has been termed idiopathic, signs of old <em>Histoplasma</em> infection (eg, calcification in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen) are often present. Thus, most experts believe that "idiopathic" disease is likely a sequela of infection with <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> (or another infection) and that the inability to identify a microorganism is due to the fact that both conditions are an abnormal <strong>response</strong> to infection rather than due to <strong>direct invasion</strong> of the mediastinum by microorganisms. </p><p>Some experts, including us, believe that there is a different form of fibrosing mediastinitis that may be truly idiopathic in nature [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. These cases are rare but lack the calcifications that are typical of old <em>Histoplasma</em> infection. In addition, the radiological appearance of fibrosis may be different in these patients ("thinner" and "tracks" along vessels or airways). Alternatively, the idiopathic version may represent disease due to undiagnosed autoimmune disorders such as IgG4 disease. (See <a class="local">'Autoimmune'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1157115965"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mediastinal granuloma and fibrosing mediastinitis are considered rare and long-term sequela of infection with <em>Histoplasma capsulatum </em> (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75641" href="/z/d/graphic/75641.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). It is thought that mediastinal granuloma and fibrosing mediastinitis begin as a relatively benign-occurring respiratory infection that disseminates to the mediastinal lymph nodes before specific cell-mediated immunity develops to contain the organism. In rare cases and for unclear reasons, two divergent responses can occur: mediastinal granuloma or fibrosing mediastinitis. These processes may develop over months to years. While it was originally believed that the pathophysiologic process represented a continuum from intense active granulomatous inflammation on one end to dense collagen formation at the other end, we now believe that each response is separate and has no overlap. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mediastinal granuloma</strong> – Mediastinal granuloma is the more common response [<a href="#rid4">4,24</a>]. The involved mediastinal lymph nodes can enlarge and coalesce into an inflamed necrotic mass referred to as a mediastinal granuloma. Although the natural history is unclear, mediastinal granuloma is more likely to be self-limiting or spontaneously resolve (possibly by regression or fistulization) than fibrosing mediastinitis, explaining why the majority of cases are found incidentally on chest imaging. However, in some cases, the enlarged mass compresses and less commonly, fistulizes with nearby mediastinal structures. Histopathology is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fibrosing mediastinitis</strong> – This reaction is extremely rare and is one of uncontrolled, invasive fibrosis that crosses fat planes. It is believed that fibrosing mediastinitis results from the leakage of fungal antigens (not the organism itself) from lymph nodes into the mediastinal space, leading to a hypersensitivity reaction followed by an exuberant fibrotic response [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Fibrosis is typically unilateral, although it can be bilateral. It is commonly progressive, resulting in compression and sometimes invasion of adjacent normal structures. Histopathology is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In both conditions, calcification frequently occurs and when seen radiologically, clinically supports old <em>Histoplasma</em> infection. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Neither condition is believed to reflect extranodal infection because the organism is not typically identified in biopsy specimens [<a href="#rid4">4,25</a>]. However, in patients with suspected mediastinal granuloma, the chance of identifying an organism may be higher if infection is recently acquired or overwhelming (eg, in an immunosuppressed patient) or significant caseations are present [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]. In our experience, an organism is found in up to 20 percent of cases with mediastinal granuloma who undergo surgical resection for their disease. In such cases, mediastinal granuloma needs to be distinguished from an infectious adenitis, which is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Forming a differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is unknown why some patients develop mediastinal granuloma while others develop fibrosing mediastinitis. However, certain genotypes may increase the odds of developing fibrosing mediastinitis, including HLA-A2 and HLA DQB1*04:02 [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. A genome-wide association study performed on 58 fibrosing mediastinitis patients compared with 7115 nondiseased controls identified several additional candidate genes that need further evaluation [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3987.html" rel="external">"Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>While in the past it was believed that mediastinal granuloma was a precursor lesion for fibrosing mediastinitis, there are no clinical or preclinical data to support this hypothesis. In our clinical experience that includes review of over 200 cases of fibrosing mediastinitis, we have seen no evidence of mediastinal granuloma preceding fibrosing mediastinitis.</p><p>It is assumed that the mechanism responsible for mediastinal granuloma and fibrosing mediastinitis due to tuberculosis is similar to that due to histoplasmosis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The mechanism that underlies fibrosing mediastinitis associated with autoimmune disorders or other precipitants is unknown.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1375816204"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mediastinal granuloma and fibrosing mediastinitis are rare conditions. Precise epidemiologic data are not available and are generally limited to case series. Cases in the United States are concentrated in endemic regions for <em>Histoplasma</em> (ie, along the Ohio and Mississippi River valley in the midwest United States) and are lower in other regions where <em>Histoplasma </em>infection is unusual (eg, northeast United States, Europe, and Asia). </p><p>While it has been estimated that over 500,000 people per year in the United States are infected with <em>Histoplasma</em> and over 80 percent of inhabitants of endemic regions have a positive <em>Histoplasma</em> skin test [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], less than 1 percent of patients with histoplasmosis develop mediastinal granuloma or fibrosing mediastinitis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75641" href="/z/d/graphic/75641.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. </p><p>Mediastinal granuloma may account for up to 10 percent of mediastinal masses in surgical series [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>The largest series of fibrosing mediastinitis was from an institution in an endemic region, and it described only 94 patients over a nine-year period [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The average age at diagnosis was 33 years, 81 percent were White patients, and there was a slight male preponderance. Similar demographics have been reported by other series [<a href="#rid4">4,34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1340433941"><span class="h1">MEDIASTINAL GRANULOMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mediastinal granuloma is a granulomatous mass that occurs in the hilum or mediastinum. Mediastinal granuloma is thought to be an uncommon immune response to infection with prior histoplasmosis or, less commonly, tuberculosis. Other causes of mediastinal granuloma are rare (eg, sarcoidosis) (see <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above). Lesions are classically heterogeneous on imaging and have various patterns of calcification. In most cases, patients with mediastinal granuloma are asymptomatic. However, symptoms occur when the mass results in compression of or fistulization with nearby structures  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127778" href="/z/d/graphic/127778.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3367236372"><span class="h2">Clinical presentation</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong> – In most patients, mediastinal granuloma is asymptomatic. Patients are typically young (4<sup>th</sup> decade) and present with an incidental localized soft-tissue mediastinal mass with calcification on chest computed tomography (CT) performed for another reason  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef127780" href="/z/d/graphic/127780.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). The history of <em>Histoplasma </em>infection is usually remote (or unknown) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Patients are often asymptomatic for years after the development of the mediastinal lesion. However, in some patients these lesions can become enlarged and tense, leading to symptoms from extrinsic compression of compliant adjacent paratracheal, hilar, or mediastinal structures. In some cases, fistulous tracks may develop into adjacent structures (eg, esophagus, airway, or pericardium), leading to decompression of the lesion, a process that may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Compression of adjacent structures (eg, vessels, esophagus, airway) can result in symptoms [<a href="#rid24">24,35,36</a>]. For example, obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef127784" href="/z/d/graphic/127784.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) may lead to the signs and symptoms of SVC syndrome (eg, headache, facial swelling), while obstruction of the esophagus may cause chest pain, odynophagia, or dysphagia. In younger children, there is potential for extrinsic compression to obstruct the trachea due to increased tracheal ring compliance, but this is less common in adults [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. Bronchial or lung compression may result in cough and symptoms of obstructive pneumonia. Unlike fibrosing mediastinitis, pulmonary hypertension is not a manifestation of mediastinal granuloma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2832.html" rel="external">"Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2241.html" rel="external">"Approach to the evaluation of dysphagia in adults"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fistulizing disease is the more concerning potential sequela of mediastinal granuloma.

Bronchial erosion by calcific lymph nodes can lead to broncholithiasis.

Chest CT findings are described below. (See <a class="local">'Chest computed tomography with contrast'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory studies</strong> – General laboratory studies such as complete blood count and routine chemistries are nonspecific and not helpful unless an acute or complicating event has occurred (eg, pneumonia or bacterial superinfection). </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2246836912"><span class="h2">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mediastinal granuloma should be suspected in a young asymptomatic patient who has an abnormal mass on chest radiograph; the threshold for suspicion should be higher in patients who live or have previously lived in regions that are endemic for <em>Histoplasma (</em>eg, along the Ohio and Mississippi River valley in central United States). Mediastinal granuloma should also be suspected in patients with a mediastinal mass who have unexplained progressive pulmonary or esophageal symptoms. The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected mediastinal granuloma centers on obtaining further imaging, typically chest CT with contrast, since in many cases a clinical diagnosis can be made without having to acquire tissue for histopathology.

There may be extrinsic compression of mediastinal structures at an isolated anatomical point, but there should be no evidence of circumferential compression of structures, the latter being more typical of fibrosing mediastinitis.

However, patients with atypical presentations (eg, lack lesional calcification on chest CT) or patients in whom other serious pathologies are suspected (eg, esophageal or lung cancer, lymphoma, IgG4 disease) typically undergo biopsy. The choice of procedure depends upon the location of the mediastinal mass. In general, the procedure with the lowest risk of complications that can avoid biopsy of vital mediastinal structures and minimize hemorrhage is chosen first. We prefer to discuss such cases with several specialties, and the high risk nature of tissue biopsy should be explained in full detail with the patient. In most cases, the initial procedure of choice is endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). However, other procedures including endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or CT-guided FNA are appropriate. When the diagnosis remains in doubt, surgical biopsy (mediastinoscopy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS], or thoracotomy) is appropriate.

It is widely thought that these disorders represent two divergent host responses in mediastinal lymph nodes that result from a prior infection (or insult). In the United States, infection with previous <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> is the most common cause. Cases due to infection with <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> are less common and other infectious etiologies are rare (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Wuchereria, Blastomyces</em>, <em>Actinomyces</em>, and <em>Treponema</em>). Noninfectious etiologies of fibrosing mediastinitis include sarcoidosis, silicosis, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) disease, radiation, autoimmune vasculitides, and select drugs; some cases are idiopathic.

This is most commonly the superior vena cava (SVC; eg, facial swelling and headache), lower airway (eg, fever, cough, hemoptysis from postobstructive pneumonia), or esophagus (chest pain, dysphagia, odynophagia).
