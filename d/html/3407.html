There is an increasing incidence of oral tongue cancer among White females less than 50 years old [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Some risk factors for the development of oral cavity cancers include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Environmental exposures </strong>– Tobacco smoking and alcohol use are the principal risk factors for developing oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma in the Western world. The chewing of betel nut quid is a significant factor throughout Asia and India. Oral tobacco use, periodontal disease, radiation, and conditions associated with immune deficiency or dysregulation have also been implicated [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>]. For example, oral tobacco and betel nut quid chewing are important risk factors for buccal mucosa cancers [<a href="#rid5">5,7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3390.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is</strong> <strong>human papillomavirus a risk factor? </strong>– Infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV 16, is associated with the rising incidence of tonsil and base of tongue cancer. However, the percentage of oral cavity cancers associated with HPV infection is significantly less, and the majority of p16 positive tumors in this location will be negative for HPV unless they originate near the circumvallate papillae [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. A possible etiologic relationship is unclear, as are the prognostic implications of HPV infection in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Routine HPV testing of oral cavity cancer is not recommended. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3378.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, staging, and clinical presentation of human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer", section on 'Nonoropharyngeal carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3809339129"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oral cavity tumors often present with local invasion, tissue destruction, and lymph node metastases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110767" href="/z/d/graphic/110767.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Staging'</a> below.) </p><p>Oral cavity cancers also tend to invade soft tissue early. Depth of invasion (DOI) is an important prognostic factor and is included in the tumor, node, metastases (TNM) classification system. Involvement of bone is usually limited to larger tumors, except for those that originate in gingival mucosa. Patients with oral cavity tumors rarely present distant metastases. Further details on the clinical presentation of oral cavity cancer are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3393.html" rel="external">"Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of oral cavity cancer requires a tissue diagnosis of a suspicious oral lesion or lymph nodes using biopsy or fine needle aspiration. A biopsy is not a definitive therapeutic procedure and should simply obtain tissue adequate for a diagnosis and not obliterate the site of the lesion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3393.html" rel="external">"Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer", section on 'Diagnosis and staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H854309770"><span class="h1">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the diagnosis of oral cavity cancer is made, a careful pretreatment evaluation is required to assess the extent of locoregional disease, as well as possible regional or distant metastasis. Clinical factors that are critical for treatment planning include tumor size, the extent or depth of invasion (DOI) which is <strong>not</strong> tumor thickness, and the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In particular, the DOI of early-stage squamous cell carcinoma involving the oral tongue is particularly difficult to assess preoperatively and is typically obtained on postoperative histology. Of note, DOI does not include the portion of the tumor superficial to the epithelium.</p><p>All patients should undergo a thorough inspection and palpation of the oral cavity. Additionally, the following pretreatment imaging is obtained:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Computed tomography (CT)</strong> – CT with intravenous contrast is widely used to detect bone invasion; CT has largely replaced older techniques, such as plain radiography and panoramic radiography of the maxilla and mandible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> – MRI may complement or replace CT scanning by providing better visualization of soft tissue involvement and gross perineural spread while also having good accuracy in detecting bone invasion. Whereas CT scanning may be limited by metallic dental restorations and cortical defects, MRI is limited by motion artifact and inflammatory reactions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT</strong> – Combined PET/CT scans may add accuracy in evaluating the extent of the primary tumor and aid in target delineation in patients receiving definitive radiation therapy (RT). PET scanning may help to identify pathologically involved lymph nodes or to clarify the status of suspicious nodes on CT or MRI that do not meet traditional size-based criteria for classification as being abnormal [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)</strong> – SLNB is an emerging technique that may provide an additional option for the assessment of regional lymph node nodes. (See <a class="local">'Sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H386460717"><span class="h1">STAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The tumor, node, metastases (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) is used to classify lip (excluding external and vermillion) and oral cavity carcinoma  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110767" href="/z/d/graphic/110767.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. The 2017 updated staging system includes important changes for patients with early-stage oral cavity cancer. Whereas prior iterations included only the maximum tumor size in a single plane (usually the surface), the AJCC eighth edition staging system now also incorporates maximum depth of invasion (DOI). Patients with &gt;5 mm DOI have a minimum tumor stage of T2; patients with &gt;10 mm depth of invasion have a minimum tumor stage of T3. Thus, patients with small but more deeply invasive tumors effectively have higher-stage tumors. Patients with more extensive local disease, regional lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis have stage III or IV disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3393.html" rel="external">"Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF THE PRIMARY TUMOR</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H453453307"><span class="h2">Treatment modalities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary surgery and definitive radiation therapy (RT) are both treatment options for patients with early-stage oral cavity cancer. For most patients with early-stage oral cavity tumors, we suggest treating the primary tumor with initial surgery (with or without adjuvant RT) rather than definitive RT. We alternatively offer RT to patients who are ineligible for or decline surgery. For example, surgical resection of the primary tumor may not be feasible or desirable if it results in significant morbidity or functional impairment. However, the use of surgery versus RT for the primary tumor has not been directly compared in randomized trials.</p><p>For patients with stage I or II oral cavity tumors, surgery with or without adjuvant RT is associated with less long-term morbidity than RT [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>] and offers more detailed pathologic staging, including depth of invasion (DOI). Definitive RT is reserved for patients who are ineligible for surgery (eg, due to medical comorbidities) or for whom surgical resection would result in severe functional impairment [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. The latter circumstance is uncommon in stage I and II oral tongue and floor of mouth primaries but is sometimes applicable to early tumors of the retromolar trigone and lip since external RT can achieve similar outcomes to surgery with acceptable morbidity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who undergo resection of the primary tumor with close (&lt;2 mm) or positive surgical margins, we suggest reresection rather than postoperative RT. For those who are ineligible for or decline reresection, we offer adjuvant RT to the primary site.</p><p>Every attempt should be made to ensure negative resection margins since positive margins are associated with a worse prognosis [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. If feasible, reresection of any positive margin is preferred. Otherwise, postoperative RT, with or without chemotherapy, is indicated. Close margins, typically defined as less than 5 mm, may also portend a worse prognosis, although a more recent study suggests a narrower margin may be acceptable [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Traditional surgical approaches are generally used for patients with early-stage oral cavity cancer. Although minimally invasive surgery, such as transoral laser resection or robotic surgery, has been used, the relative advantages of one surgical technique versus another are not well established [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. The primary benefit of minimally invasive surgery is its ability to access structures such as the oropharynx and larynx, which are not easily approached with standard instruments. However, early-stage oral cavity tumors are usually accessible via traditional transoral approaches.</p><p>Most early-stage oral cavity cancers can be excised without major, long-term, functional or cosmetic deformity. Swallowing function is generally excellent with appropriate reconstruction and postoperative rehabilitation. Likewise, short-term perturbations in speech (eg, difficulty pronouncing the letter "t" after tongue surgery) can be corrected to normal or near-normal function. As an example, an early-stage oral cavity cancer patient employed in telephone sales would generally be expected to be able to return to full-time work within three months of surgery.</p><p>Acute surgical complications can include infection, bleeding, aspiration, wound breakdown, flap loss, and fistula [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Surgical procedures such as hemiglossectomy, maxillectomy, and mandibulotomy can cause functional defects in speech and swallowing, although these may be reduced by optimal reconstruction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3396.html" rel="external">"Mandibular and palatal reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3376.html" rel="external">"Management of acquired maxillary and hard palate defects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3368.html" rel="external">"Speech and swallowing rehabilitation of the patient with head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both external beam RT using contemporary conformal techniques and brachytherapy can have a role in the management of early-stage oral cavity cancer. The general principles of RT and the role of radiation dose and schedule are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3406.html" rel="external">"General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3409.html" rel="external">"Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations"</a>.)</p><p>Small tumors in most oral cavity sites can be managed with intraoral cone or interstitial brachytherapy in order to minimize exposure of normal tissue. These techniques do not treat regional lymph node basins, however, and therefore are only appropriate to use as a single modality in selected stage I patients where the risk of occult nodal involvement is very low. Factors associated with high-risk disease or lymph node involvement include deep invasion and lymphovascular invasion.</p><p>External beam RT to the draining lymph node regions is used as the primary mode of irradiation when regional lymph nodes are at significant risk for subclinical involvement, and intraoral cone-beam radiation or interstitial brachytherapy may be added as a boost to the primary tumor. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Significant acute RT toxicities include mucositis, skin reaction, loss of taste, and dysphagia. Late complications may include skin and soft tissue atrophy and fibrosis, osteoradionecrosis (particularly with brachytherapy), lymphedema, and trismus. Xerostomia commonly occurs during the course of RT and persists after treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3408.html" rel="external">"Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Xerostomia may recover after treatment with modern RT techniques, such as three-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy. However, recovery of xerostomia in patients with oral cavity tumors may be more limited than with other head and neck sites because of higher doses of radiation to the submandibular glands and larger volumes of oral mucosa and minor salivary glands in the treatment fields. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3408.html" rel="external">"Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer", section on 'Highly conformal RT technique'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H88481623"><span class="h2">Site-specific management</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Lip (squamous cell carcinoma)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Squamous cell carcinoma can arise on the inner surface of the lip and is included with other oral cavity cancers. Cancers of the vermillion and external surface of the lip are classified now with skin cancers, as they are often the result of sun exposure and share characteristics with many skin cancers. Surgical excision is generally preferred for management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5339.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of low-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)"</a>.)</p><p>The natural history and hence prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip varies depending upon whether the lower or upper lip is involved, and this has implications for management:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower lip</strong> – Squamous cell carcinoma is more common than basal cell carcinoma in the lower lip. Lymph node metastasis usually is not seen, except in the presence of a large lesion or multiple recurrent primary tumors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Maximum DOI is a predictor for metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes for squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and, therefore, may be important for treatment planning and assessment of prognosis [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. In one report of 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip, there was a significant difference in mean DOI between patients with or without cervical lymph node metastases (5.6 versus 3.8 mm, respectively) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Whether DOI is independent of tumor stage as a prognostic factor is uncertain, but DOI (rather than thickness) is now a part of the staging system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Upper lip</strong> – Squamous cell carcinomas that arise in the upper lip and oral commissure have a worse prognosis than those originating in the lower lip. These tumors grow more rapidly, ulcerate sooner, and metastasize earlier  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68180" href="/z/d/graphic/68180.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73991" href="/z/d/graphic/73991.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid27">27-29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Upper lip cancers also have the potential for invasion into the premaxilla and nasal cavity, which can add considerable complexity to the treatment planning and ultimate functional outcome. Therefore, a more aggressive treatment strategy including prophylactic treatment of the neck is generally advocated for even early-stage upper lip squamous cell carcinomas. (See <a class="local">'Management of the neck'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Cosmetic and functional outcomes are important in planning treatment because of the role of the lips in speech, facial expression, and eating. The extent of surgical excision depends entirely upon the size of the lesion. The optimal margin for resection has not been defined [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>], but a margin ≥5 mm on final pathology is generally recommended.</p><p>There are numerous reconstructive options to restore function after surgery. Defects that involve less than two-thirds of the lip can be closed primarily, while defects involving up to three-quarters of the lip can be reconstructed with full thickness pedicled flaps from the uninvolved lip (Abbe-Estlander flaps) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. More complicated reconstructive options are available for larger defects, including the Karapandzic flap [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Mohs micrographic surgery, which is effective for treating early-stage skin cancer, has been used to treat early lip cancers but has not been directly compared with standard surgical excision [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. Therefore, we advise caution when treating lip cancer with Mohs surgery, particularly for tumors &gt;2 cm, since narrow margins may be less effective for these tumors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13708.html" rel="external">"Mohs surgery"</a>.)</p><p>In general, the prognosis for early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the lip is very good, with 10-year recurrence-free survival rates of 94 and 78 percent for stage I and II disease, respectively [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Lower alveolar ridge and retromolar trigone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The retromolar trigone is the small mucosal space that begins at the third molar of the mandible and extends posteriorly and cranially to the maxillary tuberosity. It is continuous with the buccal mucosa, upper and lower gingiva, maxillary tuberosity, anterior tonsillar pillar, soft palate, and mouth floor.</p><p>Even early cancers of the retromolar trigone have a high local recurrence rate due to microscopic extension into the mandible and a high probability of occult regional lymph node metastases [<a href="#rid36">36-38</a>]. The five-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate for early-stage retromolar trigone cancer is approximately 70 percent [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>].</p><p>Surgical therapy involves wide local excision, but resection can be technically challenging. Although small tumors may be managed with a transoral approach, many will require a lip-splitting cheek flap for exposure. Marginal mandibulectomy may be required in order to achieve tumor-free margins.</p><p>The degree of tumor invasion must be assessed before surgery as well as possible since this will determine the deep surgical margin [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. A planned intraoperative mucosal resection margin of 1 cm is recommended to achieve a final pathologic margin &gt;5 mm since there can be substantial shrinkage of the tumor specimen in formalin [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. By contrast, a deep bone margin of 1 cm is unnecessarily morbid, and instead, a margin of one tissue layer deeper than the greatest DOI is suggested. Preoperative assessment of bone invasion is notoriously difficult.</p><p>Treatment of cancers of the lower alveolar ridge is similar to that for lesions arising in the retromolar trigone. These lesions often have mandibular involvement at presentation.</p><p>The status of the teeth plays a critical role in treatment of cancers involving the upper and lower alveolar ridge. Many patients with oral cavity cancer are edentulous or have very poor dentition. In these patients, porous cortical bone serves as a poor barrier to invasion, and the risk of mandibular invasion is increased, even for early-stage cancers. Therefore, edentulous patients with even minimal cortical bone invasion should be treated with a segmental resection of bone rather than a marginal resection. By contrast, healthy teeth are a better barrier to direct tumor invasion into the medullary space of the bone, and patients with healthy teeth with an intact dental ligament, and with early-stage cancers rarely have mandibular invasion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Upper alveolar ridge and hard palate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both surgery and RT offer excellent control for early-stage squamous cell cancers of the upper alveolar ridge and hard palate. However, surgery is generally preferred because of the late effects of radiation, including osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla. Except for the most superficial cancers, surgery usually involves resection of bone including alveolectomy, palatectomy, or infrastructure maxillectomy (ie, resection of the palatine process of the maxillary bone) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The resulting surgical defects may be closed with local mucosal rotation flaps or free tissue transfer reconstruction for larger defects. However, some surgeons prefer prosthetic rehabilitation with a removable palatal obturator, which permits better inspection of the defect for disease recurrence.

For patients who are diagnosed with early-stage buccal mucosa tumors, three-year DFS rates of 75 to 85 percent for stage I and 65 percent for stage II cancers have been reported [<a href="#rid45">45-48</a>].</p><p>Surgery is typically preferred for buccal mucosa cancers, despite high local recurrence rates and technical challenges [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Early-stage buccal mucosa cancers may appear easy to treat  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69202" href="/z/d/graphic/69202.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). However, exposure of the cancer can be difficult via a transoral approach, which makes it difficult to obtain clear radial margins in an en bloc fashion. Furthermore, the short distance between the buccal mucosa and the buccal space permits early invasion to deep structures or to the skin of the anterior cheek. The surgeon must choose between taking a thin deep margin and risking recurrence versus removing skin and reconstructing both the inner and outer cheek surfaces. Although more aggressive surgery including exenteration of the buccal space and parotidectomy may improve oncologic results, the disfigurement and morbidity associated with these procedures are considerable.</p><p>The buccal mucosal surface must be reconstructed regardless of the depth of resection; inadequate soft tissue coverage will result in severe, irreversible trismus. Thus, free tissue transfer reconstruction (eg, radial forearm flap) is recommended for all but the smallest buccal cancers. In these cases, skin graft reconstruction will suffice. Even with adequate reconstruction, trismus is a significant clinical problem, and jaw exercises are required for the best functional outcome.</p><p>Postoperative radiation or chemoradiation is often necessary to maximize the likelihood of locoregional control. If RT is used, the initial treatment volume includes the primary tumor, with at least 2 cm margins. An intraoral stent may be used to displace the tongue medially to reduce the dose delivered to this organ.

Deep tongue muscle margins are not found in a single plane, in contrast with the radial mucosal margins. In addition, striated tongue muscle fibers shred or fragment with tissue handling during and after surgery, leaving a less reliable surface to assess margin status. Therefore, close deep surgical margins should be interpreted with caution, and more aggressive treatment may be indicated compared with close radial mucosal margins or close margins in other disease sites.</p><p>Definitive RT of oral tongue cancer typically utilizes external beam RT. Small (≤10 mm) and superficial lesions can be treated with either an intraoral cone or interstitial brachytherapy alone.

Tongue cancer is often believed to have a more aggressive course in younger patients (ie, &lt;40 years), but most reports have not found a difference in survival between younger and older patients [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. However, patients are at significant risk for the development of a second primary head and neck cancer.

Small (&lt;1 cm) or superficial lesions (&lt;4 mm thick) can be treated with either an intraoral cone or interstitial brachytherapy alone. An intraoral cone is more suitable for lesions located centrally or in the anterior part of the mouth. For lesions extending close to or into the tongue, an intraoral stent or bite block helps position the tongue. When a boost is given with an intraoral cone, it is delivered before external beam RT so that mucositis does not impede visualization of the lesion. When a boost is given with interstitial brachytherapy, it is delivered after external beam RT to allow for tumor shrinkage.

For clinical N0 tumors, elective lymph node dissection should include at least 18 lymph nodes. Of course, limiting the extent of dissection reduces the potential for morbidity. A supraomohyoid neck dissection (levels I to III plus IV; for subsites other than oral tongue, levels I to III) is typically sufficient for clinically N0 oral cavity cancer since level IV and V lymph nodes are rarely involved without clinical disease at other levels  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099" href="/z/d/graphic/54099.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid59">59-62</a>]. This approach includes removal of the submandibular gland but preserves the spinal accessory nerve, the internal jugular vein, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sublevel IIB may also be preserved in patients with early-stage oral cavity cancer, thus minimizing the risk of shoulder dysfunction from damage to the spinal accessory nerve, which runs through sublevel IIB.</p><p>Evidence supporting elective neck dissection includes a meta-analysis of five randomized trials that included patients with tongue and floor of mouth tumors and found that elective neck dissection of clinically negative neck nodes improved overall survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.83) and reduced locoregional recurrence (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78) in comparison with therapeutic neck dissection [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. Elective neck dissection was associated with more adverse events (risk ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.54).</p><p>Similarly, one trial reported outcomes of elective neck dissection in 500 patients with early-stage (T1-T2N0) oral cavity tumors whose nodal status was assessed by ultrasound [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. Most patients had primary tumors of the oral tongue (85 percent); and a minority had tumors of the buccal mucosa (14 percent) or tumors involving the floor of the mouth (1 percent). Following excision of the primary tumor, patients were randomly assigned to either elective node dissection or to observation followed by therapeutic node dissection for recurrence. Patients assigned to an elective lymph node dissection underwent an ipsilateral selective neck dissection that included clearance of level I, II, and III lymph nodes. If disease was detected during the elective node dissection, surgery was extended to include level IV and V nodes. Patients assigned to a therapeutic neck dissection underwent a modified neck dissection (levels I to V) if a nodal relapse was detected. Patients were also secondarily randomized to be followed by physical examination only or by ultrasound (but not CT or positron emission tomography [PET]).</p><p>At a median follow-up of 39 months, compared with therapeutic neck dissection, elective neck dissection improved both OS (three-year OS 80 versus 67.5 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92) and DFS (three-year DFS 69.5 versus 45.9 percent; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34-0.58). On subset analysis, survival benefit was limited to patients with tumor depth &gt;3 mm, although the number of patients with a smaller DOI was limited. It is unclear whether results might differ if eligibility was limited to patients with a negative neck on baseline CT or PET, or if patients treated without neck dissection had more intensive follow up imaging using CT or PET, rather than ultrasound.</p><p>Investigations are ongoing looking at the role, if any, that imaging may play in allowing some patients to avoid elective neck dissection. For example, in one study of patients with T2 to T4 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were clinically N0, a PET/CT at the time of diagnosis had a negative predictive value of 87 percent [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].

If the SLNB is negative for disease, it can often replace a planned elective neck dissection, and the neck can be observed. If the SLNB is positive for disease, nodal dissection can subsequently be performed either unilaterally or bilaterally, depending upon the results of the SLNB. If the SLNB is positive for disease on the ipsilateral side only, we perform a unilateral neck dissection. If the SLNB is positive for disease on the contralateral side or if bilateral drainage is observed by lymphoscintigraphy, we perform a bilateral neck dissection.</p><p>Clinical judgment should be used in deciding between elective node dissection and SLNB. SLNB should be performed at centers with expertise in this technique, as specialized training is required for the procedure. SLNB has been more widely adopted in Europe than in the United States for early-stage oral cavity cancer. In observational studies, the negative predictive value of this procedure is estimated at 95 percent [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. We also encourage participation in an ongoing randomized trial (NRG-HN006) evaluating the use of SLNB versus elective neck dissection in various early-stage oral cavity tumor sites.</p><p>SLNB is a safe and feasible technique [<a href="#rid65">65-68</a>] with similar survival and better functional outcomes compared with elective neck dissection in randomized trials [<a href="#rid69">69-71</a>]. In a phase III trial (Senti-MERORL), 307 patients with surgically resectable cT1-T2N0 oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers were randomly assigned to elective nodal dissection or SLNB [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Patients with a negative SLNB received nodal biopsy alone, and those with a positive SLNB received nodal dissection either during primary tumor surgery (if detected on intraoperative histologic analysis) or as a second surgical procedure (if detected postoperatively on immunohistochemistry). Bilateral nodal dissection was performed if contralateral positive sentinel lymph nodes were detected or if bilateral drainage was observed by lymphoscintigraphy. Among the 279 evaluable patients, five-year neck node recurrence-free survival (89.6 versus 89.4 percent), disease-specific survival (88.6 versus 87.1 percent), and OS (81.8 versus 82.2 percent) were similar between the node dissection and the SLNB groups. Compared with SLNB, neck dissection resulted in worsened postoperative functional outcomes until six months after surgery, based on evaluation of neck-shoulder impairment, arm abduction, and physiotherapy prescription rates.</p><p>However, interpretation of the study results is limited by the inclusion of patients with oropharyngeal cancers, which are often human papillomavirus (HPV) associated tumors that frequently present with nodal disease. Although a majority of patients received surgery alone, approximately one-fourth of patients received additional adjuvant therapy (RT, chemoradiation, or brachytherapy). Additionally, the use of neck node recurrence-free survival may be an inadequate surrogate endpoint for OS.

Continued follow-up beyond five years is generally suggested because of the risk of late recurrence and for second primary malignancies.
