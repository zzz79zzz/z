Planned TOLAC may result in labor with vaginal birth (VBAC) or unplanned intrapartum cesarean birth.</p><p>Decision-making regarding mode of birth must take into consideration the patient's personal preferences, obstetric history, data on the risks and benefits of TOLAC versus PRCB, and availability of TOLAC in the selected birth setting. Two major concerns that patients have when making this decision are the chance of successful VBAC, which can be estimated with a calculator, and the chance of uterine rupture, which is low in patients with one previous low transverse hysterotomy incision. <span class="utd-adt-cnt utd-adt-pathwys utd-content-120065">(Related Pathway(s):  <a class="utd-content-120065" href="/pathway/120065?topicRef=4479&amp;source=see_link">Trial of labor after cesarean: Shared decision-making with a pregnant patient during the first prenatal visit</a>.)</span></p><p>This topic will review issues related to choosing the route of birth after cesarean birth, including calculators to predict an individual's likelihood of success. Issues related to management of labor and birth during TOLAC and issues related to repeat cesarean birth are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116203.html" rel="external">"Trial of labor after cesarean birth: Intrapartum management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4457.html" rel="external">"Repeat cesarean birth"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2035534313"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the prevalence of attempted TOLAC was 21.7 percent in 2020 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H489090"><span class="h1">RISKS/BENEFITS OF TOLAC VERSUS PRCB</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3576997264"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The medical and obstetric benefits of successful TOLAC derive from avoidance of the potential adverse outcomes associated with repeat cesarean birth, especially multiple repeat cesarean births. Most maternal morbidity associated with TOLAC occurs when intrapartum cesarean birth becomes necessary, which is associated with increased risks for postoperative infection and other morbidities compared with PRCB. A less common but serious potential adverse outcome associated with TOLAC is uterine rupture, which can be associated with serious morbidity, particularly for the neonate in whom uterine rupture can be fatal.</p><p>Conversely, the medical and obstetric benefits of PRCB derive from avoidance of the potential adverse outcomes associated with TOLAC, primarily uterine rupture and morbidity associated with intrapartum cesarean birth. Thus, the benefits of TOLAC are closely related to having a successful vaginal birth, which has lower morbidity than both planned and intrapartum cesarean birth. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4459.html" rel="external">"Cesarean birth: Postoperative care, complications, and long-term sequelae", section on 'Complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/87237.html" rel="external">"Uterine rupture: After previous cesarean birth"</a>.)</p><p>In 2010, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health convened a Consensus Development Conference to evaluate all available evidence related to TOLAC and make recommendations for practitioners regarding the management of patients with a prior cesarean birth [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Their final report summarized the state of knowledge concerning the outcomes of PRCB versus TOLAC in patients who have undergone one or more prior cesarean births. These findings and subsequent United States data are described throughout this topic. </p><p>Large data sets from other countries are also available and report similar findings. As an example, the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System reported that term TOLAC in Canada between 2003 and 2015 was associated with an increased relative risk, but low absolute rate, of severe maternal morbidity and mortality compared with PRCB (10.7 versus 5.65 per 1000 births; adjusted rate ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.76-2.19) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The same was true for neonatal morbidity (seizures, assisted ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure) and mortality (20.8 versus 14.5 per 1000 births; adjusted RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.38-1.61).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H819465192"><span class="h2">Limitations of available evidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No large randomized trials have been performed to provide comparative data on outcomes of TOLAC versus PRCB; a systematic review identified only two randomized trials involving a total of 320 participants, with minimal data on maternal and newborn clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>It is important to recognize that many case-control and cohort studies have compared these two routes of birth. Most of these studies reported maternal and neonatal outcomes based on the actual route of birth rather than the intended route. When this type of analysis is performed, the outcomes of patients who underwent cesarean birth after an unsuccessful TOLAC were grouped along with the outcomes of those who underwent PRCB, which is a less morbid procedure and biases the findings in favor of TOLAC. The outcomes of patients who planned PRCB but spontaneously labored and gave birth vaginally were grouped along with the outcomes of patients who had a successful TOLAC, which also biases findings and leads to misleading conclusions about the actual risk of adverse events or outcomes associated with the decision to attempt TOLAC or PRCB. Analysis of these data is also complicated by imprecise definitions and outcome measurements as well as difficulties encountered when trying to characterize events and outcomes attributable to route of birth.</p><p>Although data from randomized trials would be ideal, it would be difficult to recruit adequate numbers of patients willing to consent to randomization to TOLAC versus PRCB. To overcome this problem, a propensity analysis was performed to simulate a randomized trial of TOLAC versus PRCB in patients with one prior cesarean birth [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Propensity analyses can provide helpful insights by using statistical techniques to balance the comparison groups; however, they are not a substitute for well-designed randomized trials. This propensity analysis found that the rates of endometritis, operative injury, respiratory distress syndrome, and newborn infection were lower with PRCB, whereas the rates of hysterectomy and wound complication were higher with PRCB. The authors estimated that 62 patients (95% CI 40-138) would need to undergo PRCB to prevent one maternal adverse outcome from TOLAC and 43 patients (95% CI 29-78) would need to undergo PRCB to prevent one neonatal adverse outcome from TOLAC. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2693170283"><span class="h2">Maternal outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following table summarizes maternal outcomes associated with VBAC and PRCB  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65114" href="/d/graphic/65114.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); it was derived from a 2010 systematic review of 41 studies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] and is subject to the limitations discussed above (see <a class="local">'Limitations of available evidence'</a> above). Selected outcomes are discussed in more detail below.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uterine rupture</strong> – The incidence of uterine rupture is low (in resource-rich countries), but when it occurs, it is often associated with TOLAC and is potentially life threatening. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consensus conference panel described uterine rupture risk in the following way [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], based on data in the 2010 systematic review [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Importantly, in this document, uterine rupture was defined anatomically as partial or complete separation of the uterine wall, rather than requiring anatomic separation accompanied by changes in maternal or fetal status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a hypothetical group of 100,000 patients of any gestational age who undergo TOLAC, there will be 468 cases of uterine rupture. Looked at in another way, approximately 1 in 200 TOLACs will lead to uterine rupture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a hypothetical group of 100,000 patients of any gestational age who undergo PRCB, there will be 26 uterine ruptures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The types and frequencies of major maternal and neonatal outcomes of uterine rupture would include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hysterectomy: 14 to 33 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Maternal death: none</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Perinatal death: 0 to 2.8 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The risk of rupture is higher (over 1 percent) after ≥2 prior cesareans, with induction of labor, or after a short interdelivery interval. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/87237.html" rel="external">"Uterine rupture: After previous cesarean birth"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection</strong> – Although the overall risk of maternal infection appears to be similar for TOLAC and PRCB [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], specific risks vary by clinical setting. For example, only patients in labor are at risk for intrapartum chorioamnionitis. VBAC has a lower frequency of postpartum infection than PRCB, while intrapartum cesarean birth has the highest frequency of postpartum infection [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6762.html" rel="external">"Clinical chorioamnionitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5488.html" rel="external">"Postpartum endometritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4459.html" rel="external">"Cesarean birth: Postoperative care, complications, and long-term sequelae", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Peripartum hysterectomy</strong> – Although some peripartum hysterectomies are performed because of uterine rupture during TOLAC, many others are performed because of placental attachment disorders, which are associated with prior cesarean birth: An increasing number of cesarean births increases the risk for placenta previa and, in turn, the placenta accreta spectrum  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80662" href="/d/graphic/80662.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6759.html" rel="external">"Placenta accreta spectrum: Clinical features, diagnosis, and potential consequences", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvic floor disorders</strong> – Pregnancy itself is a risk factor for future pelvic relaxation disorders. Most available evidence suggests that vaginal birth is more important than exposure to labor on the development of pelvic floor disorders later in life. Although PRCB avoids the potential risks and sequelae of pelvic trauma related to vaginal birth, the absolute benefit compared with TOLAC is unclear and does not appear to outweigh the risks of PRCB. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8079.html" rel="external">"Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Convenience</strong> – For many patients, a benefit of PRCB is that scheduled birth allows them and their family/friends the ability to make specific work-life plans for the birth and postpartum period. Although induction of labor in patients undergoing TOLAC can also be scheduled, awaiting spontaneous labor is preferred given some studies demonstrating an association between induction and uterine rupture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Personal benefits of VBAC include shorter hospital stay and quicker return to normal activities compared with PRCB.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postpartum permanent contraception</strong> – Postpartum permanent contraception (also called sterilization) is readily accomplished at cesarean birth; however, this is a minor advantage of PRCB since the procedure can be performed after a vaginal birth and often immediately following the birth. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101866.html" rel="external">"Postpartum permanent contraception: Procedures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H489123"><span class="h2">Neonatal outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data regarding the short- and long-term neonatal outcomes after TOLAC versus PRCB are limited and subject to the limitations discussed above (see <a class="local">'Limitations of available evidence'</a> above) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The 2010 systematic review of 41 studies discussed above reported the following neonatal outcomes related to TOLAC and PRCB [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality</strong> – Perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality rates were higher for TOLAC than for PRCB (perinatal mortality rate: 0.13 versus 0.05 percent; neonatal mortality rate: 0.11 versus 0.06 percent), although the absolute risk is very low.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transient tachypnea of the newborn</strong> – Transient tachypnea of the newborn was more common with PRCB compared with TOLAC (4.2 versus 3.6 percent). However, neonatal bag and mask ventilation was used more often in neonates born following TOLAC than in those born following PRCB (5.4 versus 2.5 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other</strong> – Data were insufficient to determine the direction of risk for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, sepsis, trauma, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and adverse neurologic outcomes. However, subsequent studies have reported that the rates of suspected and proven neonatal sepsis are higher for TOLAC than PRCB (suspected sepsis 5 versus 2 percent; proven sepsis 1 versus 0 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and reported an increased risk of neonatal depression and NICU admission for TOLAC versus PRCB [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3354438206"><span class="h1">FACILITY RESOURCES FOR OFFERING TOLAC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends conducting TOLAC in facilities that are able to perform an emergency cesarean birth in the event of a situation that is an immediate threat to the life of the pregnant patient or fetus [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. ACOG emphasized that this recommendation was not intended to restrict access to TOLAC and recognized the difficulty of providing this type of care, especially in rural settings. The resources necessary to perform emergency cesarean birth are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116203.html" rel="external">"Trial of labor after cesarean birth: Intrapartum management", section on 'Facility resources'</a>.)</p><p>When resources needed for emergency cesarean birth are limited, ACOG recommends that practitioners discuss the available resources at the planned birth facility with patients who are considering TOLAC. After this discussion, some patients may consider an alternative birth site that has resources for performing an emergency cesarean birth and providing the required neonatal care in the event of complications, some may tolerate higher levels of risk in order to pursue TOLAC at their preferred birth facility, and some may choose PRCB. A decision to plan for TOLAC in a setting lacking resources to perform an emergency cesarean birth should be made only after careful consideration by the patient and their health care provider. In such instances, the discussion and plan should be documented in the obstetric record. Discussion of birth options early in pregnancy can facilitate transfer of care if desired by the patient and practitioner.</p><p>We agree with ACOG that TOLAC should not be attempted as a home birth.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4152237431"><span class="h1">FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN PATIENT-CENTERED DECISION-MAKING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision for a TOLAC or PRCB is made by the patient in collaboration with their provider. The discussion should begin early in the course of prenatal care and may even begin before conception. Ongoing discussion throughout pregnancy is important as conditions may arise that alter the balance of risks and benefits of the planned route of birth. Whenever possible, clinicians should comply with the patient's preference [<a href="#rid2">2,7</a>].</p><p>This decision should be based upon the best available clinical evidence and involves a combination of factors, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Availability of TOLAC at the planned birth setting</strong> (see <a class="local">'Facility resources for offering TOLAC'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Probability of VBAC</strong> (see <a class="local">'Predicting the probability of VBAC'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A cross-sectional analysis of over 4 million singleton, cephalic, term births in individuals with a history of one or two cesarean births in the National Vital Statistics System reported the rate of successful TOLAC increased from 69.8 percent in 2010 to 74.7 percent in 2020 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Success rates vary among institutions and providers and are affected by antepartum, intrapartum, and nonmedical factors [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Factors known to affect TOLAC success rates and the individual patient's probability of success obviously need to be addressed in person-centered decision-making.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a 2010 meta-analysis, the two factors that increased the odds of VBAC by at least threefold were history of VBAC and history of vaginal birth [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The most important factor associated with failed TOLAC (ie, intrapartum cesarean birth) was a prior cesarean birth for a recurring indication, such as failure to progress. Other factors that played a role, but were not as strongly associated with failed TOLAC, were increasing body mass index and older maternal age. Induction of labor significantly reduced the odds of VBAC compared with entering labor spontaneously, but a better control group would have been patients who were managed expectantly. (See <a class="local">'Predicting the probability of VBAC'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefits and</strong> <strong>significance and estimated frequency of complications with TOLAC and PRCB</strong>, including individual patient factors that affect the risks and benefits for each birth route (see <a class="local">'Risks/benefits of TOLAC versus PRCB'</a> above) and individual patient factors that impact the risk of uterine rupture. (See <a class="local">'Candidates for TOLAC'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Unlike most medical decisions, where patients are comparing risks and benefits for themselves, the pregnant patient must compare risks and benefits for both themself and their fetus, and the risks and benefits for these two individuals sometimes do not align: A decision that reduces maternal risk may be associated with increased fetal risk and vice versa.

Of the study population of 11,856 patients, 73 percent gave birth vaginally. The overall predictive capability of the model was fair to good, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.77). (A Receiver Operating Characteristic curve plots true positives against false positives; a test with AUC 0.5 is equivalent to a coin toss whereas AUC 1.0 accurately discriminates between true positives and false positives.) The best performance was in patients with a predicted probability of vaginal birth greater than 35 percent. The nomogram was internally validated with a subset of the initial study population [<a href="#rid48">48</a>] and several independent retrospective cohorts [<a href="#rid84">84-88</a>] of patients with one or two prior cesarean births [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>In 2021, the MFMU Network entry to prenatal care calculator was updated to exclude race and ethnicity [<a href="#rid75">75</a>].

The factors predictive of VBAC were taller maternal height and a history of vaginal birth, particularly having a history of VBAC. Similar to other analyses, patients with a recurrent indication for cesarean, including arrest of descent and arrest of dilation, were less likely to have a VBAC.

It has been hypothesized that the number of patients eligible for TOLAC who opt for it rather than PRCB could be increased with use of a decision support tool that provides accurate information regarding the process and potential outcomes of both modes of birth, an individualized assessment of their likelihood of successful VBAC, and consideration of their values and preferences. However, the first large randomized trial (PROCEED) of a well-designed, person-centered decision support tool did not raise the TOLAC rate compared with usual care (TOLAC rate 43.3 versus 46.2 percent) [<a href="#rid91">91</a>]. The multicenter trial included 1485 patients less than 25 weeks with one prior cesarean birth and no contraindication to TOLAC. It is possible that usual care in the academic centers where the trial was conducted was highly effective, and the tool might be more useful in other settings.
