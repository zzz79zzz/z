         Caring for nursing home patients presents many medical and health system challenges. Most long-term care residents are over age 65 and/or have multiple chronic health conditions affecting their cognitive and physical functioning. While some individuals in nursing homes return home after receiving therapy services, most will remain in a long-term care facility until their deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the palliative care needs of individuals in long-term care settings and initiatives to improve nursing homes' palliative and end-of-life care services. While data specific to assisted living will be included, virtually all studies and programs have been conducted in nursing homes and this topic will therefore be most relevant to the nursing home population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other issues related to both palliative care and the general care of patients in nursing homes are discussed separately:

         There is a growing appreciation of long-term care residents’ needs for palliative care services, especially for those with advanced, incurable, and/or chronic illnesses. These needs include symptom management, care of the dying resident, support for family and other caregivers, assistance with decision-making regarding diagnostic evaluations, and plans for if an acute illness were to happen (ie, wishes regarding transfer to an acute care facility).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a national survey of bereaved family caregivers of nursing home residents, the following results were reported [

         Only 42 percent rated their loved one's quality of life in the nursing home as excellent, which was the lowest rating of all health care settings. By contrast, 71 percent gave an excellent rating to care delivered at home with hospice services.

         Most nursing home residents are older adults with significant physical and cognitive impairments. From 2017 to 2018, approximately one-third of the nursing home population within the United States was over age 85, two-thirds were women, 15 percent were Black persons, and 6 percent were Hispanic persons. Over 85 percent of nursing home residents needed assistance in bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring, and one-half received nine or more routine

         medications [

        </p>
        <p>
         Many nursing home residents have one or more chronic conditions that can limit their life expectancy and/or cause symptoms that add to their symptom burden. Common chronic conditions among nursing residents include Alzheimer disease and other dementias (49 percent), heart disease (20 percent), hypertension (77 percent), diabetes (35 percent), and arthritis (28 percent) [

These behaviors may occur independently or develop as the manifestation of an underlying symptom or medical condition such as pain, constipation, or infection. Management strategies for these behaviors are discussed separately. (See

         Nursing home residents have multiple physical, cognitive, and functional comorbidities. It is important that health professionals communicate with patients and their families or other loved ones about the likely trajectory of illness and that they attempt to estimate residents' prognosis. This information is necessary for decision-making regarding advance directives and to determine whether a resident meets hospice eligibility criteria. Advance directives and hospice are discussed elsewhere. (See

         For patients in nursing homes, structured interviews done at the initial intake and then at periodic intervals are necessary to ensure symptoms are being addressed and care goals are being met. These interviews also provide an opportunity to discuss hospice options for patients who are experiencing significant decline and/or are approaching death.

         Discuss the patient’s care goals – Recognizing the complexity of residents admitted to long-term care facilities, health professionals should seek to understand residents' primary goals and express a commitment to promoting consistency between residents’ care in the facility and their treatment preferences. Goals may include life prolongation independent of the resident's baseline function, promotion of functional and cognitive rehabilitation, and/or enhancing the resident's comfort. If multiple goals are identified, patients and families/other surrogate decision-makers should be counselled about prioritization of the stated goals.

         For example, while all residents should have symptoms assessed and treated as part of their care plan, some residents' may hold an exclusive focus on comfort without seeking to extend life or achieve functional gains as their highest priority goal. Estimating the resident's prognosis may assist in communication about care goals. (See

         All United States nursing homes that receive federal funding must periodically report the percentage of residents reporting moderate to severe pain using the Minimum Data Set. For patients in the nursing home, pain may be related to osteoarthritis, neuropathy, cancer, or other chronic illness. As with patients receiving palliative care in other settings, it is important that attention be made to ensure adequate pain assessment and management. Assessment should include consideration of pain onset, location, duration, quality, severity, and both alleviating and exacerbating factors. A review of past management strategies and their effectiveness should also be completed.

         Untreated pain is a particular concern for patients in palliative care, and it appears to be an important issue for nursing home residents:

          10
         </a>
         ]. Among all residents with persistent pain, 6.4 percent of residents had their pain untreated and 32 percent had undertreated pain, defined as not receiving any scheduled analgesics. Characteristics associated with untreated or potentially undertreated pain included being older (age &gt;85 versus 65 to 74), being from a racial and ethnic underrepresented group, and having cognitive impairment. Another national study reported that 16.7 percent of nursing home residents with persistent pain did not receive prescription analgesics, with older residents, those with cognitive impairment, and residents from Black or Asian groups less likely to be prescribed analgesics [

         For health care workers in the nursing home, the presence of dementia can result in challenges to pain assessment. Persons living with dementia may progressively lose the ability to self-report pain, but they may express pain in the form of distressed behaviors such as physical restlessness, resistance to dressing, bathing, or other personal care, or greater passivity and social withdrawal [

         Pain management includes consideration of nonmedication strategies (eg, massage, positioning, and music), nonopioid medications including
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         , antiinflammatory drugs, neuropathic pain medications, and topical gels and patches. While there can be concern that use of opioid medications in older adults may be associated with delirium and other undesirable side effects, chronologic age or the presence of dementia alone should not be a contradiction to opioid use among residents in long-term care settings. Residents with moderate to severe pain and/or discomfort that does not respond to other therapies should be treated with opioids, though the geriatrics prescribing principle of “start low and go slow” may be used. A stepwise approach using nonopioids followed by opioids and adjuvant analgesics has been shown to be effective for nursing home residents with dementia and pain [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, older adults may require and tolerate the same opioid dose as a younger patient. Residents' renal and hepatic function should also be considered when choosing and increasing opioid doses. Interventional approaches such as nerve blocks and radiation treatments for cancer-related pain may also be pursued.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one national study, approximately one in seven nursing home residents received an opioid for &gt;90 days, and these residents were also more likely to receive nonopioid pain medications and nonpharmacologic interventions than residents who were not treated with opioids [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Most opioids that are initially prescribed for nursing home residents are short-acting formulations in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ], although one study demonstrated that 36.3 percent of nursing home residents initially prescribed a
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/z/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Decisions related to opioid prescribing in nursing home residents should be individualized, with consideration of benefits and risks, use of short-acting agents for intermittent pain, and ongoing monitoring for appropriateness of dose reductions and opioid discontinuation if pain improves.

However, while residents with weight loss may be asymptomatic, especially if expected as part of their dementia progression, nutritional decline can be distressing to family and other loved ones, and staff caregivers. In nursing home residents with moderately severe dementia, 47 percent experience unintentional weight loss [

         While polypharmacy itself may not be considered a symptom, the volume of medications patients take on a daily or routine basis may adversely affect their appetite and contribute to nausea and constipation. A careful medication review should occur at the time of admission to a long-term care facility, with any significant change in health status, and as individuals are identified as entering an advanced or life-limiting stage of any incurable illness. In particular, over one-half of nursing home residents with advanced dementia receive medications of questionable benefit, including cholinesterase inhibitors,

         Lack of visitation by health care providers – Many physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants responsible for the care of nursing home patients and for writing orders make infrequent visits to the institution. In one national survey, clinicians with a nursing home practice spent less than two hours a week providing care to residents [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34

         High job turnover of clinical staff – Nursing home staff tend to suffer from a high rate of job turnover, which in some facilities is greater than 100 percent annually. This is reflected in issues between staff and caregivers. In one study of residents who had died in long-term care, their family caregivers and facility staff differed on the residents' prognosis and symptom burden [

          38

         Patients in nursing homes should be included in any and all decision-making as long as they have decisional capacity. An approach to the assessment of decision-making capacity is summarized in the table  (

        <p>
         For those without decisional capacity (including those with advanced dementia), these decisions fall on surrogate decision makers in collaboration with the responsible clinician. Among the most frequent decisions faced by the surrogate decision-makers for residents with dementia involve establishment of goals of care, issues related to feeding, and the treatment of medical issues, including infections and pain [

         For long-term care residents, it may be useful to prioritize their most important goals as those that prolong life, promote function, or maximize comfort. Other goals that residents may identify include achieving life goals, such as attending an important family event, completing unfinished business, achieving peace with God, and providing support for their families and other caregivers [
         <a href="#rid43">

        </p>
        <p>
         Structuring discussion around the primary goal of care may not only improve communication but also aid in subsequent decision making for long-term care residents. At least one study showed that prioritization among these goals among caregivers was feasible [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. For residents and families/other surrogate decision-makers able to articulate a primary or exclusive care goal, the clinician may then translate this goal into specific treatment recommendations that can be accepted or rejected. This communication approach may lessen the burdens of decision-making experienced by residents and families/other decision-makers.

         Use of videos has been proposed as a mechanism to promote resident and family/other caregiver understanding of goals of care and decision-making options:

         As with any treatment decision, communication regarding artificial nutrition and hydration for long-term care residents should focus on the risks and benefits of the treatment and whether the decision supports the resident’s care goals. Discussions regarding use of a gastrostomy tube for artificial nutrition and hydration occur commonly in long-term care. Other decisions include use of fluids given intravenously or subcutaneously (hypodermoclysis). Total

         </a>
         is rarely used in long-term care facilities, mostly due to logistical and financial barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
         For some residents, gastrostomy tube use is consistent with their care goals and has an acceptable risk/benefit consideration. These include individuals in whom artificial nutrition and hydration permits disease-directed treatment (eg, patients with a head and neck or newly diagnosed abdominal or pelvic malignancy) and others in whom recovery of swallowing function is an anticipated outcome (eg, patients recovering from a cerebrovascular accident). For other residents, use of a gastrostomy tube supports the goal of life prolongation and/or promoting function, including nursing home residents in a persistent vegetative or those with a progressive neurologic conditions (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
        </p>
        <p>
         Beyond these defined subsets of nursing home residents, the vast majority of decisions about gastrotomy tubes relate to patients with dementia. Among patients with advanced dementia in nursing homes, approximately one-third have feeding tubes [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ], although there are few data to suggest it improves survival [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ] or decreases the incidence of other outcomes such as pneumonia, weight loss, and pressure ulcers [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49-51
         </a>
         ]. Potential burdens associated with gastrostomy tube use include wound infections, the use of restraints to prevent residents from removing the tube, emergency room visits and hospitalizations to replace tubes that are removed or displaced and substituting the pleasure residents may have from oral intake with tube feeding and hydration. In addition, the data suggest there are significant variations in the use of feeding tubes across the United States. In one study of almost 190,000 patients, 34 percent of patients with advanced cognitive impairment had a feeding tube [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,52
         </a>
         ]. Compared with those without a feeding tube, these patients were more likely to be of younger age, non-White race, male, or divorced, had no advance directives, and had experienced a recent decline in functional status.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beyond these issues, many family caregivers report either no or minimal communication with clinicians related to the decision for their loved one to receive a feeding tube [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. This represents a significant opportunity to improve communication and decision-making. Despite these findings, there appears to be organizationally related factors associated with a greater use of feeding tubes in these patients, including greater use in for-profit, urban-located, and larger (&gt;100 bed) nursing homes [

         Long-term care residents frequently have febrile episodes or can develop infections without fever, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Deciding whether, where, and how to treat these infections requires a thoughtful discussion among clinicians, residents, and family or other informal caregivers. Provided that the nursing home is equipped to treat infections (ie, can provide antibiotics with a proficient nursing home staff), at least one study showed that infections can be successfully treated without acute care hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. In that review, patients with pneumonia (with a respiratory rate &lt;40) were effectively treated in the nursing home, which was associated with lower costs and improved morbidity and mortality rates compared with acute care hospitalization. After consideration of their care goals as well as prognosis, residents and their families/decision-makers may decide with their clinicians to seek hospital evaluation and treatment for acute infections, initially provide management in the nursing home while transferring to the hospital if a resident’s condition worsens, or focus care exclusively on the resident’s symptoms without attempting to diagnose the underlying cause of a febrile episode.
        </p>
        <p>
         Independent of their primary care goal, patients with a systemic infection in the context of advanced dementia have a poor prognosis. While families/other decision-makers and clinicians may consider infections to be reversible, the development of serious infections among patients advanced dementia usually indicates that death is approaching, regardless of whether antibiotics are administered. In one study of patients diagnosed with pneumonia, the 10-day and six-month mortality rates were 50 percent and 74 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Another study concluded that antimicrobial treatment of urinary tract infections in nursing home residents with advanced dementia did not improve survival [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. While hydration and antibiotic use may prolong short-term survival, this benefit may only be measured in days among most residents with advanced dementia [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ] and may also increase discomfort [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60,61
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, for residents with comfort as their primary goal who subsequently develop a systemic infection (eg, pneumonia), care should focus on managing symptoms rather than aggressive treatment of the infection. Their families/other decision-makers should be informed that use of antibiotics for managing infections in residents with advanced dementia will likely not promote comfort and may prolong the dying process.

         <a href="#rid64">
          64-66

         <a href="#rid67">
          67

         In a review of 786,328 Medicare Fee-for Service beneficiaries older than age 67 who died while they were nursing home residents in 2004 and 2009, the increase in hospice use from 28 to 40 percent over this five-year period was associated with significant decreases in rates of hospital transfers, feeding tube use, and a lower rate of intensive care unit use in the 30 days before death [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. However, the expansion of hospice use was also associated with a mean net increase in Medicare expenditures, reflecting greater additional spending on hospice care after adjusting for decreased spending on hospital and other care.

        <p>
        </p>

         Lack of coverage for the room and board costs in long-term care facilities – While there is a Medicare benefit that covers skilled nursing facility admissions, it is specific for rehabilitative services associated with acute care hospitalizations and ends when the patient’s rehabilitation progress plateaus or if the patient experiences an acute decline that prevents them from receiving therapy services.

         Although hospice services represent a potential major source of palliative care in nursing homes, some individuals in nursing home hospice have enrollments lasting days to few weeks given these many barriers [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67,74,75
         </a>
         ]. To expand access to palliative care, alternative models, such as palliative care consultations by external providers with palliative care expertise (specialty palliative care consultations), are being explored [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to ensuring access to hospice, all patients should be encouraged to complete Advance Care Planning. For long-term care residents, one example is the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) document, which provides a portable, valid order set for patients that can be used across the continuity of possible care settings, including the home, the ambulance, and all institutional settings [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. Initially developed and implemented in Oregon, this order enables health care professionals and patients or their surrogate decision-makers to designate a primary care goal and make specific decisions regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation, antibiotics, tube feeding, and artificial hydration. The use of such an advance care planning mechanism helps ensure respect for residents’ treatment preferences at the end of life [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78-80
         </a>
         ], although even in states that have a mature POLST program, there is significant variation in POLST completion rates among nursing homes [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81

         Caring for patients in nursing homes presents many medical and health system challenges. Most long-term care residents are over age 65 and/or have multiple chronic health conditions affecting their cognitive and physical functioning. (See

         For patients in nursing homes, structured interviews done at the initial intake and then at periodic intervals are necessary to ensure that symptoms are being addressed and care goals are being met. These interviews also provide an opportunity to discuss hospice options for patients who are experiencing significant decline and/or are approaching death. (See

         Untreated pain is a particular concern for patients in palliative care, and it appears to be a particular issue for nursing home residents, especially those with cancer. (See

         As residents’ functional status declines and death approaches, the ability to keep the patient clean becomes a more prevalent issue for the staff. Problems with cleanliness include issues related to skin and oral care as well as care required to manage incontinence. (See

         The volume of medications they take on a daily or routine basis may adversely affect their appetite and contribute to nausea and constipation. (See

         Patients in nursing homes should be included in any and all decision-making as long as they have decisional capacity. For those without decisional capacity (including those with advanced dementia), these decisions fall on surrogate decision-makers. Among the most frequent decisions faced by the surrogate decision-makers for residents with dementia involve establishment of goals of care, issues related to feeding, and the treatment of medical complications, including infections and pain.

         For long-term care residents, it may be useful to prioritize the most important goals as those that prolong life, promote function, or maximize comfort. Structuring discussion around the primary goal of care may not only improve communication but also aide in subsequent decision-making for long-term care residents. (See
