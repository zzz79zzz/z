         Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in infants and children is commonly encountered in clinical practice [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. Among pediatric patients presenting to an emergency department with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding, approximately one-third have LGIB and the remainder have an upper GI source of bleeding or the source is unspecified [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Bleeding is severe enough to warrant hospital admission in 5 to 10 percent of cases [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will discuss the evaluation of LGIB that presents with bright red blood per rectum, for which the most likely causes are organized by age group. The evaluation of children presenting with hematemesis or other signs of upper GI bleeding (UGIB) are discussed separately (see

          Upper gastrointestinal bleeding
         </strong>
         (UGIB) refers to bleeding that originates from the GI tract proximal to the ligament of Treitz (the junction of the duodenum and jejunum). It includes bleeding sources in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.

          Hematochezia
         </strong>
         describes the passage of bright red blood per rectum and usually suggests LGIB, typically from the colon or anus. Rarely, hematochezia can be caused by UGIB, due to rapid intestinal transit time or massive UGIB. (See

          Melena

         describes stools that appear black and tar-like and usually suggests UGIB. Melena may also be caused by blood from the nose that is swallowed or bleeding from the proximal small bowel. Black-appearing stools that do not contain blood may be caused by certain medications or foods. (See

         The following discussion will focus on the causes of bleeding most commonly seen in the United States and other resource-abundant settings. The likely causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) vary depending upon age  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58363" href="/z/d/graphic/58363.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Many of the disorders are encountered in more than one of these age groups. In each age group, there are other disorders that are less common but important to identify because they may be life-threatening and/or require specific treatment. The spectrum of causes is different in other parts of the world. As an example, in one report of children with recurrent LGIB in India, 24 percent had amoebic ulcers [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, various foods and medications may cause stool to falsely appear bloody or test positive for blood  (

         In a newborn infant with rectal bleeding, the rectal blood should be tested to determine whether it comes from the infant or whether it represents maternal blood, which may have been swallowed during delivery or ingested during breast feeding from cracked nipples. This is accomplished using the Apt test (hemoglobin alkaline denaturation test), which detects fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Apt test takes advantage of the different susceptibilities of adult hemoglobin A and HbF to alkali denaturation. Infant HbF resists denaturation with alkali better than adult hemoglobin A. To perform the Apt test, fresh stool is mixed with water (1:5 dilution) and centrifuged, and sodium hydroxide then is added to the supernatant [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Adult hemoglobin changes to brown-yellow within two minutes (alkaline hematin), while HbF resists denaturation and retains its pink color. Exposure of the stool sample to air for more than 30 minutes will cause HbF to have the same color change as adult hemoglobin, resulting in a false-positive result. In cases in which the Apt test is inconclusive, a spectrophotometric assay can be used to quantify the color change. HbF &gt;50 percent indicates fetal blood and HbF &lt;10 percent suggests maternal blood [

         NEC is an acute illness of unclear etiology associated with intestinal necrosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4991.html" rel="external">
          "Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Pathology and pathogenesis"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         NEC should be suspected in a newborn with nonspecific systemic signs such as apnea, respiratory failure, lethargy, poor feeding, or temperature instability, and abdominal signs including distention, gastric retention (residual milk in the stomach before a feeding), tenderness, vomiting, diarrhea, and gross or occult LGIB. Although most infants who develop NEC were born prematurely, approximately 13 percent of cases occur in term infants [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The disease occurs predominantly in infants receiving enteral nutrition. Characteristic features in the supine abdominal radiograph are seen in most infants with suspected NEC. An abnormal gas pattern, with dilated loops of bowel consistent with ileus, is typically seen in the early stages. Pneumatosis intestinalis, the hallmark of NEC, appears as bubbles of gas in the bowel wall or in the portal system.

         Newborns who have malrotation with midgut volvulus typically present with abdominal distension, emesis which may or may not be bilious, and melena or hematochezia (in 10 to 20 percent of cases). Bilious emesis in the neonatal period should be assumed to represent a surgical emergency due to obstruction until proven otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptomatic malrotation is life-threatening and requires emergent evaluation and treatment. The diagnosis can be suggested by plain abdominal radiographs, but normal radiographs do not exclude it. A limited upper GI contrast series is the best examination to visualize the position of the duodenum; failure of the duodenum to cross the midline confirms the presence of malrotation. Upper GI contrast series should be performed whenever possible, under fluoroscopy and by an experienced pediatric radiologist. The addition of a small bowel follow-through or
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="118048" href="/z/d/drug information/118048.html" rel="external">
          barium
         </a>
         enema to check for colonic malrotation is prudent in patients in whom the upper GI is normal but there is a high index of suspicion or signs of a distal bowel obstruction. Barium contrast studies may reveal a corkscrew appearance of the twisted small bowel, or a "bird's peak" if complete obstruction is present. The clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of malrotation are discussed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6477.html" rel="external">
          "Intestinal malrotation in children"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In experienced hands, intestinal malrotation can be diagnosed by color Doppler ultrasonography. Malrotation is seen as inversion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) relationship, with the SMA on the right and SMV on the left, along with other findings such as duodenal dilatation with a tapering configuration. A normal ultrasound, however, does not exclude malrotation. (See

         Newborns with Hirschsprung disease frequently have delayed passage of meconium (&gt;48 hours after birth). Some present with acute obstruction manifested by vomiting (which may be bilious or feculent) and abdominal distension. Other infants may present at several weeks of age with progressive constipation or diarrhea associated with abdominal distension. Only one-quarter of the patients have blood in the stool. The diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease should also be suspected in older infants with chronic refractory constipation, such as those who need mechanical or pharmacologic assistance to defecate. The diagnosis also is suggested by explosive expulsion of gas and stool after the digital rectal examination (squirt sign or blast sign). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5903.html" rel="external">
          "Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Significant blood in the stool with abdominal distension in infants with known or suspected Hirschsprung disease may be indicative of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (toxic megacolon) and should be considered a medical emergency. In this situation, the rectum needs to be immediately decompressed by either rectal examination and/or the placement of a rectal tube and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5891.html" rel="external">
          "Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a stable patient, a contrast enema may be used as an initial test; the study is performed "unprepped," meaning that the stool should not be evacuated by enema or other means prior to the test. When diagnostic, the enema demonstrates marked dilation of the unaffected colon proximal to the aganglionic segment, which is smaller in comparison. Anorectal manometry can be used for confirmatory testing if needed and is also necessary to diagnose ultrashort-segment Hirschsprung disease. In centers with expertise, anorectal manometry can be the initial diagnostic test, although it does not identify the extent of disease. The gold standard for diagnosis is the demonstration of complete absence of ganglion cells in the Meissner and the Auerbach plexus on a rectal biopsy specimen of intestinal mucosa and submucosa. Treatment generally is surgical resection of the aganglionic segment.

         Several types of coagulopathies can present during the newborn period. Most present with other bleeding symptoms, such as a large cephalohematoma after vaginal delivery, oozing from the umbilical stump, prolonged bleeding after circumcision or blood sampling, or intracranial hemorrhage in a term infant [

         Anal fissures are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in patients younger than one year and are also common in older children and adults. They are diagnosed easily by spreading the perineal skin to evert the anal canal. In an infant, the history often suggests painful defecation with straining, grunting, and leg stiffening or back arching consistent with withholding behavior and streaks of bright red blood on the surface of the stools. When associated with constipation, anal fissures usually respond to stool softeners and lubricants such as petrolatum (Vaseline). When associated with diarrhea, healing is hastened by keeping the perineum clean and dry [

         Milk- or soy protein-induced colitis is an inflammatory reaction caused by ingestion of cow's milk or soy proteins and is a common cause of bloody stools in infants. It occurs almost exclusively in infants and usually resolves within 6 to 18 months of age. It can occur in infants who are formula-fed, or less commonly in breast-fed infants because of cow's milk in the mother's diet. Affected infants have loose stools, often with occult or gross blood, but are otherwise healthy. Although cow's milk is the most common trigger in Western populations, up to 25 percent of patients with cow's milk protein intolerance will have a cross-reaction to soy protein, and a few infants are sensitive to other food proteins. Thus, the general term for these disorders is "food protein-induced colitis." Treatment involves meticulous elimination of the causative protein from the mother's diet if the infant is breastfed, or the use of a casein-hydrolysate formula. Approximately 10 percent of infants are sensitive to the casein-hydrolysate formula and require an amino acid-based formula. The intolerance usually resolves by 18 months of age, at which time an unrestricted diet can be resumed. (See

         Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants between 6 and 36 months of age. Approximately 60 percent of affected children are younger than one year old, and 80 percent are younger than two years. In this age group, intussusception usually is idiopathic and occurs in the ileocecal region, in contrast with older children in whom a polyp or Meckel's diverticulum or other lesions often serve as a lead point. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of intussusception are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See

         Patients may awaken from sleep with severe abdominal pain, which causes them to be irritable and draw up their legs. They vomit and may pass a stool and improve temporarily before the cycle repeats. Eventually, patients become apathetic and pale and may pass a bloody, mucoid stool. A sausage-shaped mass in the distribution of the colon, typically in the area of the transverse colon or right upper abdomen, may occasionally be palpable on abdominal examination. The stool contains gross or occult blood in most, but not all, cases and sometimes has the appearance of "currant jelly."

        <p>
         Ultrasonography is the method of choice to detect intussusception in most institutions. The diagnosis can also be established with an air or water-soluble contrast enema, which also can treat ("reduce") the intussusception in 75 to 90 percent of children in whom a lead point is not present. The choice of procedure varies with the experience of the radiologist.

         Meckel's diverticulum results from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct. It is usually asymptomatic but may cause painless rectal bleeding, which may be chronic and insidious, or acute and massive. The bleeding is often caused by mucosal ulceration of adjacent small bowel tissue due to acid produced by ectopic gastric tissue within the diverticulum. Other complications associated with a Meckel's diverticulum are obstruction, perforation, diverticulitis, and intussusception. Sixty percent of pediatric patients having complications from a Meckel's diverticulum are younger than two years of age. The diagnosis and management of Meckel's diverticulum is discussed separately.

         GI duplication cysts can be found at any level of the GI tract and frequently do not communicate with the bowel lumen. Gastric mucosa (present in approximately 50 percent of duplication cysts) can ulcerate, perforate, and form fistulas. Formation of a gastric duplication-colonic fistula is unusual but can result in a lower GI bleed [

The distinct phenotype and early age of onset suggests a pronounced genetic susceptibility and dysregulated immune response. Indeed, approximately 25 percent of patients have an underlying immunodeficiency, which can affect therapy. Whole-exome sequencing has identified several novel gene variants that are associated with VEO-IBD, including monogenic forms caused by mutations in single genes that often present during infancy [

          Shigellosis
         </strong>
         – Shigellosis occurs most commonly in children between one and four years of age. Patients typically present with fever, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea that becomes bloody. The total white blood cell count may be normal or markedly elevated, but the differential may show a greater count of band forms as compared with polymorphonuclear cells. Untreated, the disease typically lasts for 7 to 10 days, but organism carriage can continue for as long as three weeks. Potential complications of shigellosis are intestinal perforation, toxic megacolon, dehydration, sepsis, hyponatremia and hypoglycemia, pneumonia, HUS, and seizures or encephalopathy [

Presenting symptoms include fever, weight loss and abdominal pain, and occasionally bloody diarrhea or ascites. The clinical presentation, endoscopic, and histologic findings of tuberculous enteritis can mimic CD. Patients with tuberculous enteritis often have isolated ileocecal involvement, which can mimic the pattern frequently seen in pediatric CD. Tuberculous enteritis is less likely in a patient presenting with rectal bleeding or left-sided colonic disease, unless other diagnostic criteria of tuberculosis are present [

         HUS is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal injury. The highest rates are in children under the age of five years. Most cases are associated with a prodromal infection with an enteropathogen producing a Shiga-like toxin, such as

Up to 50 percent of patients develop gross or occult GI bleeding, and up to 50 percent develop renal disease. The abdominal pain in IgAV (HSP) is due to the presence of purpuric lesions within the GI tract or may be caused by intussusception, in which the involved bowel serves as a lead point. (See

          41
         </a>
         ]; a few may have lower abdominal pain from traction on the polyp. Juvenile polyps tend to be pedunculated rather than sessile, and may autoamputate, which results in significant bleeding. On occasion, polyps in the rectum present as prolapsed tissue. Polyps usually bleed after injury by fecal passage, and this usually results in bright red blood on the outside of the stool. If the polyp is located proximally, the blood will be darker and found in the core of the stool. Approximately 60 to 80 percent of these polyps are in the rectosigmoid, and some of these can be palpated on rectal examination [

         IBD is comprised of two major disorders: ulcerative colitis (UC), which affects only the colon, and Crohn disease (CD), which can involve any portion of the GI tract. The most common presenting symptoms of IBD are abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea (with or without blood), occurring in approximately 80 percent of patients with CD; approximately 20 percent of patients with CD and approximately 95 percent of patients with UC will have visible rectal bleeding. The peak incidence of IBD is in late adolescence and early adulthood, but a significant number of children present prior to adolescence and children may present even before five years of age. The diagnosis usually is suspected by the chronicity or severity of symptoms and weight loss or growth failure, which is characterized by failure to gain weight, reduced height velocity, and/or a decrease in growth percentiles, especially in those with CD. Many patients have iron deficiency and/or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), hypoalbuminemia, and elevated fecal calprotectin. Some patients with IBD may have extraintestinal symptoms, including anorexia, arthralgia, and erythema nodosum. The diagnosis is confirmed with imaging of the small bowel, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsy. (See

Malignancies may be primary (eg, GIST, lymphoma, adenocarcinoma) or represent metastatic disease from a variety of primary sites. Patients with polyposis syndromes and IBD among other conditions are at higher risk of small bowel or colonic malignancy, depending on the underlying condition, and current screening guidelines should be followed.

          Is the blood from the lower GI tract?
         </strong>
         – Red blood found in a child's stool is most often from the anus or lower GI tract but occasionally has an upper GI source. The appearance of the bloody stool helps to distinguish between these possibilities:

         Hematochezia (the passage of bright red blood per rectum) usually suggests LGIB and is typically from the colon or anus. Rarely, hematochezia can be caused by upper GI bleeding (UGIB), especially in an infant or other individual with rapid intestinal transit time, or because of a massive UGIB in an older individual. Thus, the possibility of UGIB should be considered in an individual with hematochezia and hemodynamic compromise, or in a child with risk factors for UGIB, such as underlying liver disease.

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Melena (black, tarry stools) usually suggests UGIB. It also may be caused by blood from the nose that is swallowed or bleeding from the proximal small bowel (see

          "Approach to upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children"

         ). Black-appearing stools also may be caused by certain medications (eg, bismuth or iron) or foods (large amounts of dark green leafy vegetables). These black stools can be distinguished from melena by testing the stool for blood. (See

          What are the most likely causes of the LGIB in this patient?

         In most cases of suspected GI bleeding, the clinician should examine the stool directly and test it for blood. This is because several foods and medicines may give stool a bloody appearance that may be misinterpreted by the child or their parent(s)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72978" href="/z/d/graphic/72978.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Red-colored stools resembling hematochezia may be caused by foods with red dyes (eg, Kool-Aid or fruit punch), beets, red licorice, or
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12767" href="/z/d/drug information/12767.html" rel="external">
          rifampin
         </a>
         . Black-colored stools resembling melena may be caused by ingestion of bismuth, activated charcoal, or iron, and occasionally by consumption of large quantities of chocolate, blueberries, or dark green foods. Testing is particularly important in children with equivocal symptoms, such as a well-appearing child with small amounts of red material in the stool.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common assays can be performed at the bedside and are guaiac-based. This test identifies hemoglobin by the presence of a peroxidase reaction that turns guaiac-impregnated paper blue [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Occasionally, false-positive results may occur if the patient has ingested rare red meat or peroxidase-containing vegetables (such as turnips, horseradish, broccoli, cauliflower, and cantaloupe). Whether iron supplements cause false-positive results is controversial [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. False negative results can be obtained if the patient is ingesting large doses of ascorbic acid (
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12806" href="/z/d/drug information/12806.html" rel="external">
          vitamin C
         </a>
         ) or if intestinal bacteria have degraded the hemoglobin to porphyrin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with positive guaiac tests that are thought to be possible false-positives can be further evaluated with non-guaiac-based tests, which are based on measurement of fecal hemoglobin or fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin. The sensitivity of the test for fecal hemoglobin is limited because of degradation of hemoglobin by fecal bacteria, and the overall sensitivity and specificity are similar to the guaiac test [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin is used primarily to diagnose enteric protein loss, but it is also elevated in patients with GI blood loss (upper or lower), in whom it has a sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 90 percent, compared with 68 and 73 percent, respectively, of the guaiac test [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin test can be used in patients with recurrent red stools that are guaiac-negative or in those with a possible false-positive guaiac test result.

         Duration and amount of bleeding – The patient or caregiver can estimate the amount of blood, but this is often inaccurate. A better estimate of bleeding may be obtained by asking whether there is enough blood to color the toilet water and if so, how red, and if clots are present. Note that very small amounts of blood, even a few drops, will color the toilet water.

         Color of the blood – Bright red blood is most consistent with a lower GI source, hemorrhoid, or anal fissure. However, UGIB should be considered in infants or any child with evidence of hemodynamic instability or with risk factors for upper GI bleeding. (See

         Consistency of accompanying stool – Accompanying diarrhea suggests the possibility of colitis, eg, food protein-induced colitis in an infant, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) or immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Schönlein purpura [HSP]) in a young child, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in older children and adolescents, or infectious colitis in all age groups. Acute or intermittent constipation suggests the possibility of anal fissures or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. The degree of constipation is often underestimated by children and their caretakers, so it is valuable to seek additional details about constipation-related symptoms such as pain while defecating, time spent on the toilet, withholding behavior, size of stools, and whether the stools plug the toilet.

         Distal bleeding – Several characteristics suggest that the blood is most likely from an anorectal source such as an anal fissure, hemorrhoid, or polyp. These include blood that is primarily on the outside of a formed stool, blood that is mostly seen on the toilet paper rather than in the stool, or blood that drips into the toilet after the bowel movement (sometimes called "terminal bleeding").

         The first step is to evaluate the child's hemodynamic stability by measuring vital signs and assessing for signs of shock, including tachycardia, hypotension or orthostasis, poor capillary refill and altered sensorium. Sepsis should be considered in those with fever or conditions that predispose to infection. Bowel obstruction is suggested by marked abdominal pain and distension and/or bilious or nonbilious vomiting. Children with evidence of shock, sepsis, or abdominal obstruction should be treated promptly with fluid resuscitation and other measures, as described separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6389.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For stable patients, the physical examination should investigate potential sites of bleeding. In particular, the anus should be carefully inspected for fissures in all age groups by very gently spreading each fold of the anus. Other features to note in the perianal area include large skin tags or fistulas, both of which suggest the possibility of IBD (Crohn disease [CD]) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Inflammatory bowel disease'
         </a>
         above). A rectal examination is important to evaluate for rectal polyps (but does not rule out this condition) and to obtain stool for guaiac testing. In young infants or children with a history of constipation (especially in those without associated encopresis), the possibility of Hirschsprung disease is suggested by an explosive expulsion of gas and stool after the digital rectal examination (squirt sign or blast sign). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hirschsprung disease'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The nasopharynx and oropharynx should be inspected. Recent nosebleeds can mimic GI bleeding. CD is often associated with aphthous ulcers in the mouth. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6451.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of epistaxis in children"

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The skin should be inspected for bruising, petechiae or other rashes, which suggest abnormal hemostasis, as may be seen in HUS. Palpable purpura suggests a vasculitis, such as IgAV (HSP). The presence of cutaneous hemangiomas (especially five or more) in an infant suggests the possibility of GI hemangiomatosis. However, up to 50 percent of infants with visceral hemangiomas do not have cutaneous hemangiomas [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. Jaundice suggests hepatic failure or biliary obstruction, especially if significant. The abdominal examination should evaluate for hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or other signs of portal hypertension (ascites, prominent superficial veins), masses, tenderness, abnormal bowel sounds, and for evidence of underlying peritonitis.

         More extensive laboratory testing is appropriate for those who are not well-appearing or who have symptoms or signs suggestive of a particular disorder. As an example, for children with suspected colitis (infectious colitis or IBD), the evaluation includes an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin and complete blood count (CBC), and stool testing for

          "Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms"

         ). Patients with concern for HUS should also undergo serial evaluation of CBC and renal function. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Infants and children with an abnormal abdominal examination (distension, tenderness, or abnormal bowel sounds) or who are ill-appearing should be evaluated with an abdominal plain film (two views: flat/upright or flat/left lateral decubitus) at a minimum. Patients with suspected intussusception should be evaluated with ultrasonography (and/or with an air or water-soluble contrast enema), depending on institutional protocols. (See

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) refers to bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz and thus includes bleeding sources in the small bowel and colon. It typically presents with bright red blood per rectum (hematochezia). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definitions'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Diagnostic approach
         </strong>
         – The diagnostic possibilities depend on the patient's age group and are then narrowed using a focused history and physical examination  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95763" href="/z/d/graphic/95763.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2

          table 1
         </a>
         ). A complete blood count (CBC) or hemoglobin should be measured in patients who are unwell or who have more than minimal bleeding. In most cases, the clinician should examine the stool directly and test it for blood, because several foods and medicines may give stool a bloody appearance  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72978" href="/z/d/graphic/72978.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Other laboratory tests or imaging are added to diagnose or exclude specific causes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic approach'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

          Important causes
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis of LGIB varies by age group  (

         <strong>
          Anal fissures
         </strong>
         – A common cause of low-volume rectal bleeding in all age groups. They are often triggered by constipation, which is more common during periods of dietary change (introduction of solid food or cow's milk), toilet training, or around school entry. In older children, anal fissures also may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). (See

          Milk- or soy-induced colitis

         – A common cause of bloody stools in infants, which usually resolves by 12 months of age. It can occur in infants who are formula-fed, or in breastfed infants because of cow's milk in the mother's diet. Affected infants have loose stools, often with occult or gross blood, but are usually otherwise healthy. (See
