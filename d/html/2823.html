          INTRODUCTION
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         People 65 years or older are the fastest growing segment of the population in the United States [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. By 2030, this group will comprise about 20 percent of the total population, and among older adults, the percentage of patients &gt;75 and &gt;85 years old will increase disproportionately. A similar aging of the population is present in Western Europe and Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of this demographic increase in the number of older adults is magnified by the sharp rise in the incidence of most types of cancer after age 60 years. Currently, approximately 50 percent of all cancers and 70 percent of cancer deaths occur in those ≥65 years old, and this fraction is expected to increase [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the frequency with which cancer occurs in the older-adult population, this group is significantly underrepresented in clinical trials [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. Older-adult patients who are enrolled in clinical trials represent a carefully selected subset. A systematic review of 345 cooperative group trials found no evidence of poorer survival or increased treatment-related mortality with experimental treatments compared with younger patients, despite concerns about an increased risk of toxicity [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Even when substantial numbers of older patients are included, the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire older-adult population. Patients with a poor performance status or renal, hepatic, or bone marrow dysfunction generally have been excluded, thus raising questions about the general applicability of data derived from such trials. This is particularly true for patients over 80 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Challenges specific to older patients with advanced cancer and the treatment of common malignancies in the older-adult population will be reviewed here. Detailed discussions of the therapy of specific malignancies are presented separately, and additional information on specific chemotherapy drugs can be found in the UpToDate drug database. Considerations regarding choice of therapy, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy, are found in other topics. Toxicity of other anticancer therapies is discussed elsewhere:

         The essential principles of treating advanced cancer in older adults are the same as in younger patients. However, older patients, who may have age-related organ function decline and medical comorbidity, require special attention to the risks of chemotherapy (both treatment-related toxicity and quality of life [QOL] issues), particularly in the context of estimated life expectancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following age-related changes should be considered when assessing the risk of systemic chemotherapy.

         </span>
         Aging is commonly accompanied by a decline in the function of critical organ systems, and this declining organ function probably underlies age-related loss of physiologic reserve. Older patients with little reserve are at risk for decompensation upon exposure to severe stresses such as chemotherapy. This has several implications for older-adult patients undergoing chemotherapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronologic age may not correlate with physiologic impairment and decline in functional reserve, both of which vary substantially between individuals. Thus, treatment of cancer in older adults should focus on the extent of comorbidity and functional status rather than chronologic age.

         Aging is associated with a decline in hepatic volume and hepatic blood flow [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. As a result, drug metabolism and elimination may be slowed, potentially exposing patients to higher drug concentrations for longer periods of time. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Liver function and metabolism'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with a large burden of liver metastases may have a greater than expected degree of hepatic decompensation. In the setting of decreased volume of normal hepatic parenchyma, careful monitoring of liver function is recommended in older patients, particularly when drugs metabolized by the liver are being used. In addition, comorbidities such as alcohol abuse or a history of viral hepatitis may be relevant considerations in treatment decisions. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2837.html" rel="external">
          "Chemotherapy hepatotoxicity and dose modification in patients with liver disease: Conventional cytotoxic agents", section on 'Impact of preexisting liver disease'

         Renal function, as measured by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), falls with age. However, age-related loss of muscle mass makes the serum creatinine concentration alone less reliable as a marker of GFR in older patients. Estimation equations have been derived to estimate GFR. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Kidney function and drug excretion'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the diminished renal reserve in older-adult patients, volume depletion can lead to exaggerated reductions in renal function [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Thus, careful attention should be paid to fluid management in patients who develop chemotherapy-associated vomiting or diarrhea.

         Bone marrow reserve diminishes as a part of normal aging, placing older patients at greater risk for severe and prolonged chemotherapy-related cytopenias [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         ]. Dose reduction and/or delay may be necessary; another alternative is the use of hematopoietic growth factor support during treatment. (See

         Normal aging is associated with an increasing risk of coronary artery disease, an increased frequency and severity of valvular heart disease, and a decrease in ventricular compliance [

         Sarcopenia, increased age, and inactivity may all contribute to loss of muscle mass. Unlike cachexia, sarcopenia, which is defined by loss of skeletal muscle mass two standard deviations below sex-specific normal values for young adults [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], does not require the presence of weight loss. Whereas most people with cachexia are sarcopenic, most sarcopenic individuals are not considered cachectic. Muscle loss in the setting of obesity is known as sarcopenic obesity, which is prevalent in older adults [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ] and is also noted in advanced cancer. The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial and can include disuse; changing endocrine function; chronic diseases; inflammation; insulin resistance; nutritional deficiencies; some forms of cancer treatment, notably

         Loss of muscle mass places older individuals at risk for further muscle wasting associated with the effects of the malignancy and chemotherapy, which in turn reduces mobility and functional status.

         Older-adult patients, particularly those over the age of 75 years, often have multiple other medical conditions at the time of diagnosis of cancer [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The most common conditions are anemia (often from occult blood loss related to the primary tumor), hypertension, gastrointestinal diagnoses, and heart disease [

        </p>
        <p>
         For seriously ill patients with severe comorbid illness that results in a short life expectancy (particularly one year or less), the risks of chemotherapy often outweigh its benefits. Most of these patients should receive supportive care rather than chemotherapy, with attention to palliation of symptoms. Available prognostic tools for use in clinical decision-making for older adults are available through

         On the other hand, palliative chemotherapy is reasonable for older-adult patients with metastatic cancer who have chronic conditions that are not imminently life threatening.

         Quality of life (QOL) is a crucial component of decision-making when treating older cancer patients. The available data suggest that older patients are just as willing to try chemotherapy as their younger counterparts, but less willing to endure severe treatment-related side effects [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

        <p>
         There are few data about how chemotherapy affects QOL in older patients [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. A major unanswered issue is whether the higher response rates and generally longer survival seen with modern combination regimens (as compared with a strategy of sequential single agents) are outweighed by the greater likelihood of side effects and adverse impact on QOL. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15802.html" rel="external">

         Aging is a highly individualized, multidimensional process. Chronologic age does not reliably predict physiologic decline. The process of aging has been represented as a continuum ranging from functional independence to pre-death [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. At one end of this spectrum, a healthy older individual has no significant limitations in activity and only minimally reduced functional reserve. With progressive increase in comorbidity, an individual becomes more vulnerable and has a decreased functional reserve. This physiologic decline results in significant limitations, although there may be the ability for some recovery. Frailty, the far end of the spectrum, is characterized by severe limitations with little or no ability to withstand treatment or serious illness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronologic age alone is not an indication for a change in therapeutic plan or drug dosing in older adults. If renal function is normal and there is no significant comorbidity, most chemotherapy agents can be given in full doses. However, dose modifications or a change in the agents used is often required when drug toxicity overlaps with comorbid conditions or there is an increased susceptibility to complications.

         Medications that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (particularly CYP3A4) have the potential to increase the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs either by reducing their conversion to nontoxic metabolites or by increasing their conversion to toxic metabolites. On the other hand, agents that induce enzymes in the P450 pathway (eg,

By contrast, a "frail older-adult" patient has an increased risk of toxicity, and thus may not be able to tolerate a full course of treatment. In this situation, treatment may need to focus more heavily on improving quality of life (QOL), rather than prolonging survival [

         The most common method to measure physiologic reserve and functional status in cancer patients is the clinician-estimated performance status (PS). There are two widely used scales, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785" href="/z/d/graphic/58785.html" rel="external">
          table 3

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Both the ECOG PS and KPS are useful to assess a patient's ability to tolerate chemotherapy and to assess short-term prognosis. Regardless of age, patients with a poor PS (eg, ECOG PS &gt;2, KPS &lt;60) usually tolerate chemotherapy poorly and have a short median overall survival. However, PS tends to underrepresent the degree of functional impairment in the older patient [

         A more comprehensive understanding of an older patient's functional state can be obtained by use of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. ADL refers to the skills that are necessary for basic living, and include feeding, grooming, transferring, and toileting. IADL refers to the skills required to live independently in the community, including shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, preparing meals, and the ability to take medications.

         Assessment of functional status with the ADL and IADL scales is a component of the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) that is used by geriatricians to identify frail older patients at high risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, hospitalization, and death. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Incorporating a more thorough geriatric assessment of function using the CGA can aid treatment decision-making in older cancer patients. As an example, in one report, formal evaluation using a CGA influenced therapeutic decision-making in 82 percent of 161 patients referred for geriatric oncology consultation [

Parameters included within this model include age, type of cancer, the proposed chemotherapy regimen, renal and hematologic function, hearing, and activity levels from the CGA (ability to take medications, physical activity, social activity). This approach was significantly better than the clinician assessment of KPS for predicting chemotherapy toxicity  (

In an independent validation cohort including 250 patients ≥65 years, CARG score correlated with frequency of toxicities, with 37 percent of patients with low CARG scores experiencing chemotherapy-related toxicities versus 62 of those with medium and 70 percent of those with high CARG scores [

         Both systemic hormonal therapy and chemotherapy can have an important role in the management of early breast cancer in older adults. In addition to the patient's expected survival, comorbidity, and functional status, a knowledge of the status of regional lymph nodes, primary tumor size, histopathology, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and whether or not there is expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu all must be considered in making specific recommendations.

         Management of metastatic breast cancer in patients &gt;65 years old follows the same principles as in younger patients, with a few exceptions. Like younger patients, older patients are unlikely to be cured of metastatic disease, and the goal of therapy is palliation rather than cure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the higher frequency of hormone receptor expression and the tendency toward more indolent tumor growth, older patients with an unknown hormone receptor status and without life-threatening or rapidly progressive disease should receive a trial of endocrine therapy. If there is a response or a prolonged period of stable disease with the initial endocrine treatment, several different endocrine agents should be tried in succession to maximize quality of life (QOL) for the longest period of time. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/761.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Chemotherapy may be considered when a tumor becomes refractory to endocrine therapy or as first-line therapy if life-threatening or rapidly progressive disease is present. Sequential single-agent therapy is often chosen rather than combination chemotherapy in older patients with metastatic breast cancer. Osteoclast inhibition significantly reduces the risk of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases; the choice of agent (ie, a bisphosphonate or

         Adjuvant chemotherapy is underused in patients &gt;65 years old, despite the significant reduction in recurrence and death associated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Although individual trials have provided little information on chemotherapy effectiveness in this population, pooled analyses of data indicate that older patients derive as much benefit from FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy as do younger patients, although the incremental benefit from

         Randomized trials have established the superiority of concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy has become the preferred approach for most unresected patients with pathologic stage III disease.

         Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy in older-adult patients with stage III NSCLC is associated with an increased incidence of severe toxicity, subset analyses have shown that survival at two and five years is similar to that in younger patients. However, older-adult patients managed with chemoradiotherapy may be at increased risk of cardiac disorders even if they were free of such problems prior to the diagnosis of NSCLC [

         Some evidence suggests that comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is prognostic and may also predict those at highest risk of toxicities from treatment. For example, in a prospective study of 85 patients at least 75 years old with inoperable, locally advanced NSCLC who underwent CGA and the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13), those classified as fit or medium-fit by CGA were administered concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, while unfit patients received best supportive care [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. Fit and medium-fit patients had longer median overall survival than unfit patients (23.9 and 16.9 months, respectively, versus 9.3 months). Among patients receiving chemoradiotherapy, higher scores on the VES-13 were associated with shorter overall survival and higher risk of serious toxicity. Geriatric assessment in cancer patients is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See

         Approximately one-third of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ≥70 years old. Standard chemotherapy regimens have caused increased toxicity in this population, although survival was similar to younger patients. By contrast, single-agent chemotherapy or dose attenuation caused less toxicity but resulted in inferior survival.

          Approach to the healthy older-adult patient
         </strong>
         – For the healthy older-adult patient with minimal comorbidity and near-normal functional reserve, aggressive treatment including full doses of chemotherapy is warranted, especially in the potentially curative setting, and can yield results that are similar to those in younger patients.

         Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may be useful to treat chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, there is controversy about use of these agents in patients being treated with curative intent because of concerns about inferior disease outcomes in some but not all studies. This subject is addressed in detail elsewhere. (See

          Approach to the frail older-adult patient
         </strong>
         – For the frail older-adult patient, therapeutic goals may need to focus primarily on quality of life and symptom palliation, rather than prolonging survival. (See
