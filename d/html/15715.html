These conditions range in severity from relatively benign disorders that do not impact lifespan to malignant clonal diseases that progress rapidly. This topic will review the classification of mast cell disorders, provide a brief clinical description of each disorder, and then discuss an approach to the patient suspected of having a mast cell disorder.</p><p>Specific mast cell disorders are discussed in greater detail separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4784.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103161.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in children: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4784.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103174.html" rel="external">"Systemic mastocytosis: Determining the subtype of disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4787.html" rel="external">"Advanced systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4290513"><span class="h1">MAST CELL PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mast cell disorders present with signs and symptoms that are caused either by activation of mast cells or by mast cells infiltrating organs and interfering with normal function [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. To understand the possible presentations, a brief review of the physiology of mast cells is helpful.</p><p>Mast cells reside within the connective tissue of all vascularized organs and in mucosal tissues. They are most numerous in the skin and in the mucosal tissues of the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Their numbers and densities are highest at interfaces between the internal and external environments where they act as sentinels and can respond rapidly to foreign organisms, antigens, and toxins. Evolutionarily, mast cells were probably most beneficial in rapid responses to venoms, parasites, and possibly bacterial infections [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>When activated, mast cells release a variety of vasoactive mediators, such as histamine and arachidonic acid metabolites, from cytoplasmic granules and membrane lipids within minutes that form the immediate response and also generate and release cytokines and chemokines over hours that recruit other inflammatory cells into the involved tissues. These mediators are responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and allergic diseases, including flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and anaphylaxis. These same symptoms are seen in the various mast cell disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373" href="/z/d/graphic/98373.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Thus, patients with mast cell disorders have signs and symptoms that overlap with those of allergic reactions and allergic diseases, making diagnosis challenging. The normal biology of mast cells and the functions of mast cell mediators are reviewed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3979.html" rel="external">"Mast cells: Development, identification, and physiologic roles"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3972.html" rel="external">"Mast cell-derived mediators"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3981.html" rel="external">"Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction"</a>.)</p><p>Tryptase is the mast cell granule mediator that is most useful clinically, although its biologic functions are not fully understood. Although tryptase is released by both mast cells and basophils upon activation, mast cells contain approximately 500-fold more than basophils, and thus, serum tryptase is a relatively specific marker for mast cell burden and activity [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. An acute rise in serum tryptase concentration indicates involvement of mast cells in clinical events, and a persistent elevation in serum tryptase indicates an increase in total body mast cell number. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/389.html" rel="external">"Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis", section on 'Elevations of tryptase in nonanaphylactic patients'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1309754785"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION OF MAST CELL DISORDERS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mast cell disorders can be broadly divided into three types: primary, secondary, and idiopathic  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166" href="/z/d/graphic/74166.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Mixed presentations can be seen in the same patient (eg, a patient with mastocytosis who also has IgE-mediated allergy). The relationship between them can also be depicted as a Venn diagram  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119560" href="/z/d/graphic/119560.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). All of these disorders can present with signs and symptoms caused by widespread activation of mast cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373" href="/z/d/graphic/98373.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, they differ in severity and involvement of various organ systems [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2626039528"><span class="h2">Mast cell activation syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) was first proposed as a distinct idiopathic disorder in 2010 [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In 2022, an expert working group expanded the definition of MCAS to include primary and secondary mast cell disorders as well, making MCAS essentially an umbrella term that describes a clinical presentation rather than a specific diagnosis. Therefore, in patients meeting the criteria for MCAS, primary and secondary etiologies should be investigated. If these are not found, then idiopathic mast cell disorders should be considered  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166" href="/z/d/graphic/74166.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>The clinical presentation of MCAS involves episodes of symptoms due to mast cell-mediator release, which improve in response to therapies that target mast cells and their mediators (eg, antihistamines, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9300" href="/z/d/drug information/9300.html" rel="external">cromolyn</a> sodium, antileukotriene agents). There should be elevations of tryptase in the serum or elevations of mast cell mediators in the urine following episodes of symptoms, which return to normal between episodes. Interpretation of tryptase levels is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Measure serum tryptase'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of MCAS requires that <strong>all of the following three criteria</strong> be met [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Episodic, objective signs and symptoms consistent with mast cell activation involving at least two of the following organ systems: skin, upper or lower respiratory systems, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373" href="/z/d/graphic/98373.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Note that subjective symptoms alone (fatigue, difficulty concentrating) in the absence of signs and symptoms in two other organ systems specified above does <strong>not</strong> warrant an evaluation for mast cell disorders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evidence of systemic mast cell-mediator release, corresponding temporally to the presence of symptoms. In case of frequent recurrent episodes, mediator release should be ideally documented on at least two occasions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Serum total tryptase is the most specific for mast cell activation, and an increase from the patient’s baseline to a level of (1.2 x baseline) + 2 ng/mL is considered indicative of mast cell activation. (See <a class="local">'Measure serum tryptase'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other mediators (ie, 2,3-dinor-11-beta-PGF<sub>2-alpha</sub>, N-methyl-histamine or LTE4 in a 24 hour or spot urine sample) can be used if serum tryptase assays are not available [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. An increase of more than 100 percent (ie, to 200 percent or greater) above baseline has been proposed as a diagnostic threshold for these mediators, provided that the test result is above the normal range for the assay [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Stated differently, to be indicative of mast cell mediator release, the level of one or more of these mediators should at least double after an episode of symptoms, and the doubled value must exceed the upper limit of normal. However, specific cutoff limits for mediators other than tryptase are not well established, so if these are used to support the diagnosis, the clinical presentation should be highly suggestive of mast cell activation [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/389.html" rel="external">"Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Response to medications that stabilize mast cells, reduce mast cell mediator production, block mediator release, or inhibit the actions of mediators. (See <a class="local">'Initial management'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of MCAS can be problematic. MCAS can be overdiagnosed, for example, based on elevations in mediators that have not been validated or reproduced as clinically useful indicators of mast cell activation, such as chromogranin A or heparin [<a href="#rid10">10,14,15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3980861689"><span class="h2">Primary mast cell disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary disorders of mast cells are rare. They include mastocytosis (both cutaneous and systemic) and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome. Primary mast cell disorders are characterized by clonal populations of mast cells that arise from an affected progenitor and display abnormal genetic and surface markers. The associated molecular defects affect mast cell proliferation or activation pathways.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2668512028"><span class="h3">Mastocytosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The best characterized primary mast cell disorder is mastocytosis. Both systemic and cutaneous forms of the disease exist and both forms can be associated with systemic signs and symptoms due to release of mast cell mediators.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3366387172"><span class="h4">Systemic mastocytosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Systemic mastocytosis (SM) primarily presents in adults, with an approximate prevalence of 1 per 10,000 in the population (all ages) [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Abnormal mast cells proliferate and infiltrate the skin, bone marrow, and other organs, leading to a variety of symptoms, physical findings, and abnormalities on routine laboratories  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91167" href="/z/d/graphic/91167.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). There are several types of SM, ranging from benign to malignant. Patients experience episodes of symptoms caused by mast cell-mediator release, which last a few minutes to several hours. Common signs and symptoms include flushing, itching, abdominal cramping, tachycardia, and hypotension. Some patients present with hypotensive reactions to Hymenoptera (eg, wasps, bees) stings, even in the absence of detectable venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), or unexplained recurrent anaphylaxis. Episodes of symptoms may also be triggered by medications (narcotics, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], iodinated contrast agents), as well as by emotional stress, surgical procedures, and viral illnesses  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70309" href="/z/d/graphic/70309.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p>The majority (approximately 80 percent) of adult patients with SM demonstrate a characteristic skin finding called urticaria pigmentosa (UP), which is also called maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63025 graphicRef97908" href="/z/d/graphic/63025.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. A helpful diagnostic clue is Darier's sign, which is the development of urtication (localized swelling and erythema) directly over and around a lesion of UP/MPCM within a few minutes if it is scratched or rubbed. This is due to release of mediators from the mast cells in the lesion. UP/MPCM is unique to mastocytosis. It may be present in both the systemic and cutaneous forms of the disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4784.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>An elevated baseline serum total tryptase in a patient who is in their normal state (ie, not during or within a few hours of symptoms) is strongly suggestive of SM. Tryptase elevations after systemic anaphylaxis can occur in patients without mast cell disorders as well. If tryptase is elevated after an episode of symptoms, it should be measured again at least a few days later to see if levels return to the normal range. Persistent tryptase elevations may indicate that the total body burden of mast cells is increased, which strongly supports the diagnosis of mastocytosis. Normal tryptase levels are between 1 and 11.4 ng/mL (some laboratories consider 15 ng/mL to be the upper limit of normal). Patients with SM typically demonstrate total serum tryptase at baseline &gt;20 ng/mL. However, the more common explanation for a persistently elevated tryptase level is hereditary alpha-tryptasemia, a genetic trait that may occur in up to 6 percent of the general population. Patients can also have both SM and hereditary alpha-tryptasemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/135236.html" rel="external">"Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia"</a>.)</p><p>Stem cell factor (SCF) is critical for mast cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The transmembrane receptor for SCF is KIT (encoded by the proto-oncogene <em>kit</em>). More than 90 percent of adult patients with SM have a gain-of-function point mutation (D816V) in exon 17 of <em>kit</em>. This mutation is the only well-characterized molecular defect associated with both increased mast cell numbers in tissues <strong>and</strong> clinical signs and symptoms of mast cell activation. KIT mutations are most readily identified in bone marrow mast cells, and a bone marrow biopsy is usually required to make the diagnosis.</p><p>SM is diagnosed according to major and minor criteria, including characteristic multifocal mast cell aggregates in the bone marrow  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827" href="/z/d/graphic/82827.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).Evaluation and diagnosis of mastocytosis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4784.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H455449839"><span class="h4">Cutaneous mastocytosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) typically presents in infants and young children and usually resolves spontaneously by adolescence. The estimated incidence is less than 1 per 20,000 in the population (all ages) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In CM, mast cells accumulate in the skin but not in other organs, although patients may have systemic symptoms due to mast cell mediators diffusing from activated skin mast cells into the circulation. CM in infants and children typically presents with the distinctive skin findings of UP/MPCM (70 to 90 percent of cases). The appearance of UP/MPCM in children is often different from that in adults, with lesions that are more variable in size and shape  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105581" href="/z/d/graphic/105581.html" rel="external">picture 1C</a>). Other forms of CM in children are mastocytomas  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76891" href="/z/d/graphic/76891.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) and diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95683" href="/z/d/graphic/95683.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). Children with DCM do not have individually discernible lesions, but rather a diffuse thickening and slight darkening of the skin  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103181 graphicRef105584" href="/z/d/graphic/103181.html" rel="external">picture 4A-B</a>). Children with DCM are prone to blistering, severe pruritus, and severe systemic symptoms, such as systemic anaphylaxis, upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) cramping, diarrhea, gastritis, ulcer disease, and GI bleeding.</p><p></p><p>Most children with UP/MPCM and mastocytoma have normal baseline serum tryptase, and any degree of elevation requires further follow-up and possible evaluation for systemic disease [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Children with DCM may have elevated baseline tryptase even without systemic disease, although persistently elevated or rising tryptase levels should prompt an evaluation for systemic disease. Evaluation and diagnosis of mastocytosis in children is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103161.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in children: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2367015693"><span class="h3">Monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS) was first described in 2007 and recognized as a distinct primary mast cell disorder by an international consensus conference in the same year [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. MMAS typically presents in adults with recurrent and episodic symptoms of mast cell activation, such as flushing, abdominal cramping, and hypotension, similar to patients with SM. However, these patients do <strong>not</strong> have UP/MPCM or the characteristic mast cell aggregates in their bone marrow (a major criterion for SM) and have baseline serum tryptase values that are normal or only mildly increased [<a href="#rid20">20,21,23,24</a>].</p><p>Patients with MMAS display one or two minor clonality criteria for SM, but do not fully meet requirements for that diagnosis [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. A clonal population of mast cells in the bone marrow can be demonstrated by the presence of KIT point mutations (most commonly D816V) and aberrant mast cell surface expression of CD25 (alpha chain of the high affinity interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor, not found on normal mast cells) and, less consistently, CD2 (lymphocyte function antigen-2 [LFA-2]) or CD30 expression [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, the diagnosis of MMAS can be challenging because KIT mutations may be only detectable in a bone marrow sample enriched for mast cells (rather than in unfractionated bone marrow) or when sensitive diagnostic assays based on allele-specific PCR or digital droplet PCR are employed. Thus, referral to a specialty center is often required to make this diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3710816565"><span class="h2">Secondary mast cell activation disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Secondary mast cell activation disorders include classic allergic disorders and other conditions in which mast cells are apparently normal in quantity and function but are responding to an identifiable external stimulus  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119560" href="/z/d/graphic/119560.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166" href="/z/d/graphic/74166.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Activating stimuli include allergens, autoantibodies, physical factors, infections, drugs, or products of complement activation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57791" href="/z/d/graphic/57791.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). Secondary causes of mast cell activation disorders are far more prevalent than primary or idiopathic mast cell disorders. In most cases, clinicians would not think of the above disorders as secondary mast cell activation disorders.

In addition, aplastic anemia is variably associated with increased expression of SCF, leading to a proliferation of mast cells in the bone marrow. Elevated tryptase levels are seen in some myeloproliferative variants of hypereosinophilic syndromes.

This group includes chronic spontaneous urticaria, idiopathic anaphylaxis, idiopathic angioedema, and idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (IMCAS)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166" href="/z/d/graphic/74166.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Mast cell activation may be mostly localized to one organ system (eg, the skin in chronic spontaneous urticaria) or it may be systemic (idiopathic anaphylaxis and IMCAS).</p><p>It is possible that disorders that are classified as idiopathic may ultimately be shown to be primary mast cell disorders in the future if new genetic defects are identified. Alternatively, these disorders may prove to be secondary mast cell disorders for which a mast cell-activating stimulus exists but has not been identified. For example, delayed anaphylaxis to meat ingestion caused by the carbohydrate allergen galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose was probably classified as idiopathic anaphylaxis in many patients until IgE directed against this allergen was identified. Likewise many patients with MMAS were diagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis until it was recognized that they had features of a monoclonal mast cell population [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

However, in IMCAS, episodes of symptoms are not always caused by triggers that the patient has been shown to be allergic to, so the designation of idiopathic is assigned.

Flushing may be induced by exercise, alcohol, temperature changes, and emotional events. In the author's experience, patients with mast cell disorders develop flushing in association with signs and symptoms in other organ systems, whereas flushing in isolation (eg, chest or the upper neck) is an uncommon presentation and may be due to other causes, such as autonomic dysfunction. The differential diagnosis of flushing is extensive and includes hormonal, neurologic, dermatologic, iatrogenic, and cardiovascular etiologies [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The flushing observed in mast cell disorders is episodic, of longer duration, lasting minutes to a few hours, and usually is not accompanied by sweating, whereas perimenopausal hot flashes usually last two to four minutes and are often accompanied by sweating.

Histamine and lipid-derived mast cell mediators (such as leukotrienes) contribute to abdominal pain and diarrhea. Multiple food and environmental intolerances with negative testing for IgE-mediated allergy does not warrant further evaluation of MCAS as the primary origin of symptoms, although these patients may have other immune or non-immune basis for their reaction to multiple foods and chemicals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H224036817"><span class="h2">Respiratory and naso-ocular</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mast cell activation can result in upper and lower airway symptoms, including rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, conjunctival injection and ocular itching, and bronchoconstriction, resulting in shortness of breath and wheezing.

An assay for serum total tryptase is available as "ImmunoCAP tryptase" and can be obtained through many commercial laboratories [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. A "baseline" level (ie, a level when the patient is in their usual state of health) should be obtained. Values &gt;11.4 ng/mL are considered elevated in most diagnostic laboratories. A tryptase level should also be obtained within four hours after symptoms, when possible, to provide evidence that mast cells are responsible for the patient's symptoms. <strong>Increases greater than 1.2 x baseline value + 2 ng/mL are considered indicative of mast cell activation</strong> [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

If the blood was collected <strong>during symptoms</strong>, then another sample should be obtained in a few days when the patient is in a baseline state.

Familial tryptase elevations inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern due to duplications or higher copy numbers of alpha-tryptase gene (<em>TPSAB1</em>) have been described; however, it is not clear whether tryptase elevation in these families is associated with mast cell activation [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. It should be noted that a finding of HaT in a patient with elevated tryptase does not rule out mastocytosis as HaT can be seen together with mastocytosis in some patients.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4784.html" rel="external">"Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Disorders with similar clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3518796853"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/109417.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Mast cell disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1092715"><span class="h1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Categorization of mast cell disorders</strong> – Disorders of mast cells can be divided into three categories: primary, secondary, and idiopathic  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74166" href="/z/d/graphic/74166.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). All of these disorders can present with signs and symptoms of mast cell activation but differ in severity and involvement of various organ systems  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373" href="/z/d/graphic/98373.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The relationship among disorders that involve mast cell activation can be expressed as a Venn diagram  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119560" href="/z/d/graphic/119560.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Classification of mast cell disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Primary disorders of mast cells include mastocytosis (both cutaneous and systemic) and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome. All are rare. Primary mast cell disorders are characterized by clonal populations of mast cells that arise from an affected progenitor and display abnormal genetic and surface markers. The associated molecular defects affect mast cell proliferation or activation pathways. (See <a class="local">'Primary mast cell disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Secondary mast cell activation disorders are relatively common conditions in which mast cells are normal in quantity and function and are responding to an activating stimulus. Such stimuli include allergens, autoantibodies, physical factors, infections, drugs, or products of complement activation. Examples of secondary mast cell activation disorders include allergies to foods, drugs, and medications, physical urticaria, and, rarely, mast cell activation disorders associated with autoimmune disorders or malignancies. (See <a class="local">'Secondary mast cell activation disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Idiopathic mast cell disorders are conditions in which mast cell activation occurs, but there is no consistent trigger that accounts for all of the symptoms, and a clonal population of mast cells cannot be demonstrated. This group includes idiopathic anaphylaxis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and idiopathic angioedema, as well as idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome. Mixed presentations can occur in individual patients. (See <a class="local">'Idiopathic mast cell disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Characteristic signs and symptoms</strong> – The organ systems most often involved in mast cell disorders are the skin, gastrointestinal tract,  respiratory (upper and lower) tracts, and the cardiovascular system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98373" href="/z/d/graphic/98373.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Common signs and symptoms of mast cell activation include flushing, urticaria, diarrhea, naso-ocular congestion, wheezing, or syncope or near-syncope due to hypoperfusion of the brain. (See <a class="local">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to diagnosis</strong> – The diagnostic evaluation for mast cell disorders involves a detailed review of symptoms and possible triggers, a physical examination for skin lesions that are characteristic of mastocytosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63025 graphicRef105581" href="/z/d/graphic/63025.html" rel="external">picture 1A, 1C</a>), exclusion of secondary causes of mast cell activation, and measurement of serum tryptase  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef109873" href="/z/d/graphic/109873.html" rel="external">form 1</a>). Any plausible secondary mast cell disorder should be excluded. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serum tryptase </strong>– Serum tryptase is the most specific marker of mast cell activation available. Tryptase is persistently elevated (usually &gt;20 ng/mL) in systemic mastocytosis, and milder elevations are variably seen in other mast cell disorders and in some cases of diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis in infants and children. In patients with a normal tryptase at baseline, the demonstration of transient elevations of tryptase immediately after symptoms is important in proving that mast cell activation is the cause of the patient's symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Measure serum tryptase'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referral</strong> – If a secondary mast cell disorder potentially explains the presentation, referral to an allergy specialist for evaluation of specific disorders is appropriate. If the patient is found to have symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of a primary mast cell disorder or idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome, referral to a mast cell disease research center is suggested. (See <a class="local">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Theoharides TC, Valent P, Akin C.
