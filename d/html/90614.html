         Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is the transition from the complete mechanical circulatory and respiratory support provided by CPB to the unassisted function of the patient's native heart and lungs. It is a gradual, multistep, interdisciplinary effort involving the surgeon(s), anesthesiologist(s), perfusionist(s), and operating room nurse(s). This topic will discuss the process of weaning from CPB after completion of the cardiac surgical procedure.

         Intraoperative problems are commonly encountered in the immediate postbypass period; these are discussed separately. (See

         arm (temperature) – Generally, rewarming should be accomplished slowly to a target nasopharyngeal temperature of 37.0°C (but not higher), and a bladder (core) temperature of approximately 35.5°C prior to weaning. The target nasopharyngeal temperature should not be exceeded as this may result in cerebral injury [

         nesthesia – Plan for postbypass anesthesia. Either a volatile anesthetic administered via a vaporizer attached to the CPB circuit or a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is typically used to maintain anesthesia during CPB [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-13

          "Management of cardiopulmonary bypass", section on 'Maintenance of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade'
         </a>
         ). Subsequently, during weaning from CPB, either volatile anesthetic administration is reinstituted via the anesthesia machine, or the TIVA technique is continued. Additional monitoring such as bispectral index (BIS) may be useful to guide titration of inhaled and/or intravenous (IV) anesthetics during weaning and the postbypass period [

         djunct drugs – Prepare adjunct drugs that are likely to be used during weaning from CPB, such as antiarrhythmic agents, inotropic drugs, and vasoactive infusions, should be prepared and immediately available to avoid distractions during weaning. Protamine is an exception, and should only be prepared just prior to administration to avoid unintentional premature neutralization of heparin. Adjunct drugs may also include inhaled agents such as

         ir – Air in the cardiac chambers is removed by the surgeon (see
         <a class="local">
          'Surgeon's preparation'
         </a>
         below), aided by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) monitoring and close communication with the anesthesiologist to assess adequacy of air removal.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Air may accumulate in the aortic root, left ventricle (LV), and left atrium (LA) during surgery, particularly if the left heart chambers have been opened, and may embolize to the systemic circulation after removal of the aortic cross-clamp (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114097 graphicRef114100 graphicRef114098 graphicRef114099" href="/z/d/graphic/114097.html" rel="external">
          movie 1A-D
         </a>
         ). When the lungs are reinflated and mechanical ventilation is reestablished, pulmonary venous blood is displaced into the LA, along with any air bubbles trapped in the pulmonary veins. Embolization to the coronary arteries may cause myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and ventricular dysfunction, while embolization to the cerebral circulation may cause neurologic dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The goal of de-airing procedures is to reduce cerebral and systemic air embolization as much as possible. The anesthesiologist typically places the patient into the Trendelenburg position during the de-airing process, since this may reduce the quantity of air entering the cerebral circulation.

         hythm – Reestablish an adequate perfusing heart rhythm before weaning. Normal sinus rhythm is ideal, but temporary epicardial pacing is employed if sinus rhythm cannot be achieved or to treat bradycardia. When atrioventricular (AV) conduction is normal, atrial (A) pacing is used. Otherwise, AV pacing is preferable to ventricular (V) pacing so that AV synchrony and optimal ventricular preloading are maintained. (See

         Removal of intracardiac air remaining within the left-sided chambers of the heart. The surgeon achieves air removal largely by "venting" through the suction applied to the anterograde cardioplegia line in the ascending aorta (termed the "aortic root vent") or other vent catheters in the left side of the heart. Also, the surgeon often "massages" the heart to force air out of the left cardiac chambers. The de-airing process is facilitated by TEE monitoring by the anesthesiologist.

         The surgeon and anesthesiologist direct the perfusionist to gradually decrease the amount of blood diverted to the CPB circuit, which allows some blood to remain in the right atrium (RA). This process is evident on the monitor because pulsatility is noted on the central venous pressure (CVP) tracing (and pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] tracing, if available), followed by the arterial blood pressure (BP) +tracing (

         The perfusionist continues to infuse blood through the aortic cannula, thereby restoring the circulating blood volume as venous drainage is further reduced. Once the left ventricle (LV) is adequately filled and is ejecting a sufficient stroke volume (as evidenced by the pulse pressure on the arterial pressure waveform), the perfusionist stops diverting blood from the RA to the CPB circuit, clamps the venous drainage line completely, and communicates that the patient is now "off bypass" (ie, weaned from bypass).

         Exact timing of initiation of protamine administration (before or after aortic decannulation) varies according to institutional and surgical preferences. However, the aortic cannula should be removed before heparin neutralization is complete, so that clot does not form on the aortic cannula tip, which might lead to arterial thromboembolism (

         Typically, 500 to 1500 mL of residual heparinized whole blood remains in the venous reservoir and tubing of the CPB pump after removal of the venous and aortic cannulae. This whole blood has not been further processed; therefore, it contains all of the clotting factors and platelets that are helpful for restoring hemostasis after reinfusion. However, residual pump blood also contains heparin. There are several methods to safely reinfuse this pump blood into the patient, and to neutralize any residual heparin (if necessary) [

         Residual pump blood may be hemoconcentrated by the perfusionist using the CPB circuit and then infused into the patient over a brief period (typically 10 to 15 minutes) via a primed IV tubing leading from the circuit that is connected by the anesthesiologist into an existing peripheral IV catheter or CVC port. Such direct reinfusion allows rapid delivery of the blood, including platelets and clotting factors. However, to avoid heparin rebound, residual heparin in the residual pump blood must be neutralized with administration of protamine timed to coincide with completion of reinfusion. If it is necessary to reinfuse blood slowly (eg, to avoid hypervolemia), an additional small dose of protamine (eg, 25 to 50 mg) is typically administered after the infusion is complete because protamine has a short half-life and will have been rapidly cleared after the initial dose.

         An alternative method is collection of residual pump blood into a separate blood transfusion bag, thereby allowing reinfusion later in the postbypass period. If this method is selected, residual heparin contained in the pump blood is neutralized by administering an additional small dose of protamine (eg, 25 to 50 mg) or a protamine infusion at approximately 25 mg/hour over two to four postoperative hours [

         Another method used by many centers is processing residual reservoir blood and any additional blood that is subsequently suctioned from the surgical field with a blood salvage device such as a "cell saver." Since salvaged blood is concentrated and washed by cell saver devices, there is minimal residual heparin concentration. Thus, additional protamine administration is not necessary. However, platelets and other clotting factors are removed during cell saver processing. (See

         Temporary epicardial pacing is usually employed after cardiac surgery with CPB via atrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wires placed by the surgeon before weaning from CPB. (See

        <p>
         Temporary epicardial A pacing is preferred to treat sinus bradycardia because this option provides an atrial kick and anterograde conduction through the His Bundle, resulting in coordinated ventricular contraction. However, since the AV delay may be prolonged after cardiac surgery, optimal pacing is achieved in some patients with AV sequential pacing to improve mechanical coupling between atria and ventricles [

         Prior to separation from CPB, a regular rhythm with a rate of 80 to 90 beats per minute allows adequate diastolic filling time to optimize CI [

         For bradycardia, AOO, DOO, or VOO pacing is used to allow asynchronous pacing that will not be interrupted by oversensing of the surgical electrocautery. In these modes, the atrium, ventricle, or both are paced as necessary, but the pacemaker has no sensing response and there is a higher risk of R on T phenomena.

         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/950.html" rel="external">

         When the patient's intrinsic heart rate (HR) is adequate (ie, &gt;75), a synchronous pacemaker mode (DDD, AAI) may be employed. Such synchronous modes avoid the potential for pacing competition and R on T phenomena. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/950.html" rel="external">
          "Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection", section on 'DDD or DDDR pacing'

         However, surgical electrocautery causes electromechanical interference (EMI), with resultant atrial and ventricular oversensing and inhibition of pacing function. Also, the radiofrequency identification wand used to detect retained surgical sponges near the end of the procedure may cause EMI [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Thus, before applying a DDD or AAI pacemaker setting, the anesthesiologist must confirm that the patient has an underlying perfusing rhythm and adequate HR. This is done by pausing the pacemaker output, checking the ECG, and confirming appropriate ventricular ejection by inspecting the arterial BP tracing on the monitor. (See

         The temporary epicardial pacemaker should be set to a synchronous (sensing) mode for all patients before transport to the intensive care unit. Inappropriate asynchronous pacing may cause competition between the pacemaker and the patient's intrinsic rhythm, or more importantly, a rare but life threatening "R-on-T" phenomenon that results in ventricular fibrillation.

         The term "failure to wean" from CPB is applied to patients with low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) who are unable to maintain oxygenation, adequate cardiac output (CO), and end-organ perfusion when withdrawal from extracorporeal circulation support is attempted [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. In one large study, failure to wean from CPB on the first attempt or a requirement for mechanical assist devices to achieve weaning occurred in 14.5 percent of 6120 patients [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Factors associated with failure to wean included older age, left ventricular dysfunction, previous cardiac surgery, presence of mitral valve regurgitation, coagulopathy, and longer duration of CPB.
        </p>
        <p>
         Appropriate planning and communication are necessary during management of postbypass low CO syndrome (ie, cardiogenic shock). The anesthesiologist prepares additional vasoactive drugs and performs ongoing assessment of the need for mechanical circulatory support such as an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), ventricular assist device (VAD), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [

         The causes of unsuccessful weaning from CPB are usually multifactorial, as one problem compounds others. For example, it may not be possible to sustain satisfactory blood pressure (BP) and myocardial perfusion in a hypotensive patient when adequate preload cannot be maintained due to excessive bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Urgent reinstitution of CPB may become necessary if BP, CO, and organ perfusion are inadequate [

         The perfusionist prepares the CPB machine and circuit. In general, these CPB components should remain primed (ie, filled with the patient's blood) until it is certain that the patient is stable and will not need to return to CPB.

         </span>
         If protamine has been administered, the anesthesiologist must re-administer heparin before reinstitution of CPB. As with initial systemic heparinization, a dose of 300 to 400 units/kg is given; alternatively, the heparin dose may be determined by point-of-care testing (ie, HepCon) if available. It may be necessary to administer additional heparin to offset the effect of any residual protamine. (See

         Once CPB has been reinstituted, the surgeon corrects any underlying technical problems. Often, surgical issues are addressed with the heart still beating. In some cases (eg, bleeding from an incision site or inadequate flow through a graft), replacement of the aortic cross-clamp and a repeated dose of cardioplegia are necessary to achieve electromechanical silence to facilitate adequate surgical repair.

         The majority of patients wean from cardiopulmonary successfully and are transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) without life-threatening problems. However, certain problems may appear later (eg, left or right ventricular failure, bleeding, arrhythmias, graft compromise, air entry into the coronary arteries, or compression of the heart upon removal of the sternal retractor. Thus, continued vigilance is critical even after successful weaning and includes assessment of hemodynamic status, trends in doses of inotropic agents, and myocardial function (assess using transesophageal echocardiography [TEE]), as well as acid-base status, and lactate levels. Myocardial function can be assessed using TEE.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, removal of the sternal retractor followed by chest closure is associated with hemodynamic changes including a reduction in cardiac index and stroke volume index [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. The causes include a reduction in venous return due to compression of the heart by the sternum and a limitation on the ability of the ventricle to relax and accommodate returning blood. These changes may require medication adjustment, fluid administration, or reopening of the chest and reassessment. Patients who do not tolerate closure may be managed with delayed sternal closure.

         Weaning from CPB is a complex, multistep, interdisciplinary team effort. We suggest a checklist for preparations for weaning (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>

          table 1
         </a>
         ). This ensures that the patient is adequately rewarmed; blood gases, electrolytes, and hemoglobin are checked; and ventilation is reestablished. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is employed before weaning to assess residual intracardiac air, during weaning to assess adequacy of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) filling and function, and after weaning to perform a complete TEE assessment of the surgical repair.

         Hemodynamic goals during the weaning process are targeted to achieve stable physiologic parameters and adequate organ perfusion. Typical goals include heart rate 80 to 90 beats/minute (which may require pacing of the atrium, ventricle, or both), mean arterial pressure 60 to 90 mmHg, and adequate filling of the ventricles to achieve a cardiac index 2.0 to 2.4 L/min per m

         Key steps during the immediate postbypass period include venous and arterial decannulation, reversal of anticoagulation with protamine administration, reinfusion of pump blood, maintenance of optimal pacemaker function, and achievement of hemostasis (

         If urgent reinstitution of CPB becomes necessary, the perfusionist prepares the CPB machine and circuit, and the anesthesiologist re-administers the initial systemic heparin (typically 300 to 400 units/kg) if protamine has already been infused. Once CPB has been reinstituted, the surgeon corrects any underlying technical problems. The patient is assessed for other cardiac and noncardiac problems before further attempts to wean from CPB. In selected patients with refractory ventricular dysfunction resulting in persistently low cardiac output, mechanical circulatory support may be necessary (eg, intraaortic balloon pump [IABP], ventricular assist device [VAD], extracorporeal membrane oxygenator [ECMO]).

         Patients who are successfully weaned from CPB may demonstrate instability or deterioration in the period after bypass.
