Easy bruising can be defined as bruising without a history of trauma or bruising after minor trauma that would not have caused bruising in the past. Differentiating between bruising that might be considered normal versus clinically significant is challenging given that there may not be specific symptoms and signs.</p><p>This topic will describe particular aspects of the clinical evaluation that can aid a provider in distinguishing bruising that is due to a pathologic versus a benign process. Specific disorders associated with bruising and the approach to patients with a bleeding diathesis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">"Inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5939.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with unexplained thrombocytopenia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6680.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5936.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H428230978"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In one United States survey of 500 healthy adults, 18 percent reported easy bruising [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This finding is consistent with many other studies in which the frequency of easy bruising in healthy individuals ranged from 12 to 55 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Women are more likely than men to report easy bruising [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7213111"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A bruise (ecchymosis) is a collection of blood beneath the skin resulting from extravasation of blood from surrounding vessels. Easy bruising can result from abnormalities affecting the blood vessels themselves, the surrounding skin and subcutaneous structures, platelet number and function, or coagulation cascade function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemostasis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a>.)</p><p>Physical injury to a blood vessel normally triggers a vigorous physiologic response. Damage to endothelial tissue causes activation and adhesion of circulating platelets with the assistance of von Willebrand factor. This in turn results in the rapid formation of a platelet plug at the site of injury. Stabilization of the plug via fibrin deposition subsequently results from activation of the coagulation cascade  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75450" href="/z/d/graphic/75450.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). A problem or defect at any step of this process will increase the risk of abnormal bruising and bleeding, regardless of the degree of trauma.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H428230883"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The etiology of bruising can be broadly classified by the anatomic/physiologic defenses against bleeding  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67597" href="/z/d/graphic/67597.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The following list includes the main categories with their most commonly associated etiologies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disorders of blood vessels and surrounding tissue (eg, physical abuse, vitamin C deficiency, connective tissue disease)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Platelet abnormalities (eg, drugs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120264" href="/z/d/graphic/120264.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), systemic illness including infections, von Willebrand disease)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coagulation disorders (eg, coagulation factor deficiency, liver disease, vitamin K deficiency)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H428230906"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As bruising is a common complaint, the clinician should be familiar with important symptoms and signs that require further workup. The history and physical examination are more useful than laboratory testing in this initial assessment. The principal goal of the clinical history and examination is to distinguish easy bruising from normal bruising, from other skin lesions that can be mistaken for bruising, and from physical abuse. Laboratory testing is used in selected cases for further evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7213118"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough history is integral to a successful evaluation and helps to avoid unnecessary laboratory testing. Questionnaires used in hematology clinics can help identify individuals who need further workup; however, these questionnaires tend to be detailed and their usefulness is still being evaluated [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. For the primary care clinician, the greatest value comes from their high negative predictive value and the ability to avoid the workup for common disorders such as von Willebrand disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1307.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease"</a>.)</p><p>It is important to remember that the bleeding history depends on the patient having been exposed to challenges to hemostasis such as surgery, tooth extractions, or menorrhagia. In young children, the bleeding history and the presence of a family history may be negative, and they still require evaluation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2061949"><span class="h3">Associated trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One of the first questions that should be asked is whether there was any trauma associated with the bruises. Normal bruising is to be expected with moderate to severe trauma. Easy bruising is suspected when the patient denies any history of trauma or if there is bruising out of proportion to mild trauma. By definition, easy bruising is not associated with moderate to severe trauma.</p><p>A lack of physical trauma related to a bruise raises suspicion of an underlying bleeding diathesis. However, this can sometimes be misleading. Some patients, particularly those who are fair skinned, overweight, and female, can develop bruising with minimal trauma and may not remember being injured.</p><p>In the setting of physical abuse, a history of physical trauma may not be volunteered. Young children, women, and older adults are at higher risk for nonaccidental trauma. It may be helpful to interview the patient without the presence of the patient’s caregiver or partner to help determine if the patient has been abused. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15294.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3007.html" rel="external">"Elder abuse, self-neglect, and related phenomena", section on 'Warning signs'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2062026"><span class="h3">Location and severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The location of bruising on the distal extremities suggests normal bruising, likely due to known or unknown trauma with activity (eg, falls, sports, bumping into furniture). By contrast, easy bruising usually occurs on multiple areas of the body.</p><p>Severity and frequency are also important; patients with generalized bruising and/or large, frequent bruises may be more likely to have a true bleeding disorder. Easy bruising is considered significant when there are five or more bruises greater than 1 cm in diameter (as defined by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5936.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7213125"><span class="h3">Bleeding history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any history of significant bleeding that accompanies bruising should alert the clinician to an underlying bleeding disorder.</p><p>A patient's prior history of invasive procedures or surgery, including dental work and past deliveries, should be obtained. Procedures requiring transfusion raise the index of suspicion regarding an underlying hemorrhagic tendency. Inquiring whether the bleeding was immediate or delayed can also be helpful; disorders associated with platelet dysfunction may demonstrate immediate bleeding, compared with a more delayed onset with coagulation cascade disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79969" href="/z/d/graphic/79969.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>A history of surgical procedures or other major injury without abnormal bleeding is good evidence against the presence of a significant inherited bleeding disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder", section on 'Patient history'</a>.)</p><p>The age of onset of symptoms may distinguish between a congenital versus an acquired bleeding disorder. Problems with bruising since childhood suggest a possible congenital disorder. By contrast, onset of symptoms in middle age or later suggests an acquired condition or comorbid state that predisposes to bleeding.</p><p>The menstrual history may also help identify a bleeding disorder. A female patient may notice that problems with bleeding started during menarche. Menorrhagia (menstrual flow that does not taper after more than three days) and metrorrhagia (bleeding in between periods) are common in women with bleeding disorders.</p><p>The patient should also be asked about bleeding with minor injuries (eg, shaving, cuts, falls). Associated bleeding from other sites (eg, recurrent epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hemarthrosis) should prompt further investigation for an underlying bleeding disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7213139"><span class="h3">Medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed inventory of medication exposures should include prescriptions drugs, over-the-counter medications, and dietary supplements (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10049" href="/z/d/drug information/10049.html" rel="external">vitamin E</a>, ginger, gingko). Several medications are associated with an increased risk of bruising  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120264" href="/z/d/graphic/120264.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Drug-related bruising is most often related to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), anticoagulant medications, antiplatelet agents, and glucocorticoids. Other commonly used agents that can predispose to bleeding include antidepressants (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9886" href="/z/d/drug information/9886.html" rel="external">sertraline</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9743" href="/z/d/drug information/9743.html" rel="external">paroxetine</a>) and antibiotics (eg, penicillins, cephalosporins).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7213146"><span class="h3">Nutrition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bruising can result from a number of underlying nutritional problems, including deficiencies of dietary protein, vitamin C, and vitamin K. These deficiencies are less common in more developed countries where these nutrients are readily accessible in the average diet. However, certain populations may be prone to these nutritional deficiencies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Protein malnutrition is more common in less developed countries, where access to protein-rich foods is limited, and among individuals with specialized diets who avoid protein. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5364.html" rel="external">"Healthy diet in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5883.html" rel="external">"Malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings: Clinical assessment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vitamin C deficiency, or scurvy, occurs mostly in severely malnourished individuals, including institutionalized, chronically ill patients and those with alcohol abuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5367.html" rel="external">"Overview of water-soluble vitamins", section on 'Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vitamin K deficiency is more common among those with bacterial overgrowth, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and alcohol abuse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2624.html" rel="external">"Overview of vitamin K", section on 'Vitamin K deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7213153"><span class="h3">Family history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient should be asked if there is any easy bruising or bleeding among the patient’s family members. A family with only males affected suggests an X-linked disorder such as factor VIII or factor IX deficiency. By contrast, a family with males and females affected equally suggests an autosomal disorder such as von Willebrand disease, which is the most common congenital disorder of hemostasis. The less common disorders, such as inherited factor V and factor XI deficiencies, have a similar autosomal inheritance pattern. It is important to note, however, that a negative family history of easy bruising or bleeding does not exclude the possibility of hemophilia due to de novo mutations, a pedigree that lacks biological males, or inaccurate information. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5936.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with bleeding symptoms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1310.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1308.html" rel="external">"Inhibitors in hemophilia: Mechanisms, prevalence, diagnosis, and eradication"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1333.html" rel="external">"Factor XI (eleven) deficiency"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7213160"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The appearance of bruising may assist with diagnosis of the underlying etiology. Bruises should be distinguished from other forms of subcutaneous bleeding, which may also occur along with bruising. The presence of other examination findings may also help narrow the diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8756663"><span class="h3">Appearance and distribution</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The distribution of bruising can be helpful. Bruises related to normal physical activities tend to appear on distal upper and lower extremities. For children one to three years old, bruises are commonly found on the anterior tibia and knee, followed by upper legs and forehead, as a result of falling from learning how to walk or run. Older patients may be at increased risk of bruising from falls and poor tissue turgor, leading to bruises over the upper extremities when being assisted with ambulation.</p><p>Bruises appearing on the trunk, back, or face should raise one’s suspicion of an underlying bleeding disorder and/or the possibility of physical abuse in both children and older adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15294.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3007.html" rel="external">"Elder abuse, self-neglect, and related phenomena", section on 'Warning signs'</a>.)</p><p>The color of the bruising may indicate how long ago a traumatic injury occurred [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Most bruises are often characterized as “black and blue.” Within a day or two of onset, bruising may be red-brown. Over several days, bruises can turn to green as hemoglobin is converted to biliverdin, and then yellow as biliverdin is catabolized to bilirubin.</p><p>Bruises should be distinguished from telangiectasias. Whereas bruises are generally dark and dull in color, telangiectasias are bright and usually red  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52483" href="/z/d/graphic/52483.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Telangiectasias over the lips, tongue, nasal cavity, and skin are indicative of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1345.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2062151"><span class="h3">Other forms of bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Normal bruising from trauma can be confused with other types of bleeding, including petechiae and purpura. Normal bruises are usually small and superficial in depth. They do not spread into deeper tissues beyond the skin. The presence of petechiae and purpura suggest a bleeding disorder rather than normal bruising.</p><p>Petechiae are small capillary hemorrhages that appear smaller than bruises. They characteristically develop in crops in areas of increased venous pressure, such as the dependent parts of the body  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73905" href="/z/d/graphic/73905.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Petechiae are the smallest bleeding lesions (pinhead in size), and suggest problems with platelet number or function. Petechiae are not normal and always need to be further evaluated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6680.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia in adults", section on 'Skin and other sites of bleeding'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder"</a>.)</p><p>Purpura are larger in size than petechiae with variable shape and involve bleeding into subcutaneous tissues. Purpura can be seen in a variety of bleeding disorders, including thrombocytopenia and coagulation cascade disorders. Palpable purpura can be seen in vasculitic processes such as immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72094" href="/z/d/graphic/72094.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). These lesions may also be painful or tender. An underappreciated phenomenon is so-called “senile purpura,” which is seen in patients over age 65 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54977" href="/z/d/graphic/54977.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). Senile purpura are non-palpable, purple bruises with small red patches that fade to brown over a span of a few weeks. They are found on the forearms and legs due to loss of subcutaneous tissue with aging [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].
