         For some patients, dialysis offers neither a survival nor a quality-of-life advantage. Such patients should be offered conservative (nondialytic) kidney management (CKM) as an alternative to dialysis. This topic review describes CKM as a treatment option for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who elect not to pursue dialysis or transplantation.

         Other related issues such as palliative care for and ethical issues in patients with ESKD and withdrawal of dialysis are discussed elsewhere.

         CKM is a treatment option for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD; ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) that focuses on providing kidney supportive care to promote quality of life without pursuing dialysis or transplantation. CKM is distinct from the predialysis care of patients with stage 5 CKD who plan to pursue kidney replacement therapy when indicated. CKM is also distinct from withdrawal of dialysis, which refers to discontinuation of maintenance dialysis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1877.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney palliative care: Withdrawal of dialysis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The guiding principle in CKM is to align care with the patient's preferences in order to achieve their personal goals, which typically focus on enhancing quality of life and improving symptoms. Interventions to delay progression of kidney disease and manage the complications of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) may still play an important role in CKM as long as they are directed to help with the patient's specific goals. The components of CKM are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Components of CKM'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ideally, patients and their health care teams arrive at the decision to pursue CKM through shared decision-making. However, it should be recognized that some patients receive CKM due to resource constraints limiting access to dialysis; this is sometimes referred to as choice-restricted CKM.
        </p>
        <p>
         CKM is best delivered through a collaborative, interdisciplinary team, which generally includes a nephrologist, primary care clinician, nurse, dietician, social worker, and, when appropriate, the palliative care team.

          Survival with CKM or dialysis

         Survival of patients treated conservatively is variable, depending upon their comorbidities. In general, survival is longer for patients who undergo dialysis compared with CKM. However, patients who choose CKM tend to be older with greater burden of comorbidities and poorer functional status. In many studies that performed subgroup analyses, there was no difference in survival for patients with advanced comorbidities who elected dialysis compared with CKM [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Typical data comparing survival between patients who chose dialysis or CKM come from a retrospective study in which 311 patients over the age of 70 participated in discussions regarding this choice when their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) fell to &lt;20 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Overall median survival was higher among patients who opted for dialysis compared with those who opted for CKM. However, the survival advantage conferred by dialysis was substantially reduced among patients who had cardiovascular or other severe comorbidities. Among patients &gt;80 years, there was no difference in survival between dialysis and CKM groups. Similarly, a systemic review including 25 observational studies reported that the increased survival associated with dialysis compared with CKM was attenuated or absent in older patients, especially those with comorbidities [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. A subsequent meta-analysis examined 22 observational studies that compared dialysis with CKM; the attenuated survival benefit of dialysis in older patients and those with comorbidities persisted in some multivariable and subgroup analyses [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, many studies in this meta-analysis likely were limited by selection bias and/or residual confounding.

         Patients on dialysis experience symptom burdens similar to those with cancer; such symptoms are often under-recognized and undertreated [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Older patients with multiple comorbidities who start dialysis require more medical interventions and are more commonly hospitalized compared with those treated conservatively [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,10,11
         </a>
         ]. Their symptom burden is unlikely to improve substantially with dialysis. In addition, dialysis itself may cause or worsen some symptoms, such as muscle cramping and fatigue. Conversely, among patients who choose CKM, symptoms from their comorbidities or kidney failure tend to remain stable until the last two months of life, at which time they can increase sharply, requiring careful reassessment and management [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Many of these symptoms can be treated effectively with CKM [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Symptom management focused on optimizing quality of life'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, a cohort of older patients who elected dialysis spent approximately 50 percent of their survived days (173 days/patient/year) either receiving dialysis or in the hospital compared with patients treated conservatively who spent less than 5 percent (16 days/patient/year) of their time in the hospital [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Similar findings with longer hospitalizations, a higher rate of intensive care unit admission, and a lower rate of inpatient palliative care involvement have been reported among patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who were treated with dialysis compared with patients treated without dialysis [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11,14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who choose CKM are also more likely to receive services such as palliative care and hospice to manage symptoms and end-of-life care. For example, in one observational study, patients who chose CKM rather than dialysis were more than four times as likely to die at home or in a hospice facility [
         <a href="#rid13">

          —
         </span>
         In a survey of 150 countries conducted by the International Society of Nephrology, 81 percent of countries reported offering CKM [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. In resource-limited countries, the rationing of kidney replacement therapy is common. However, the availability of CKM was not associated with country income. High-income countries were more likely to report that CKM was delivered as chosen or medically advised, as opposed to "choice-restricted." (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Only 38 percent of countries reported that CKM services were easily accessible, of which none were low-income [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Less than one-half of countries utilized multidisciplinary teams (46 percent), shared decision-making (32 percent), or provided psychological, cultural, or spiritual support (36 percent) as part of their CKM care. One-quarter of the countries trained their clinicians on delivery of CKM.
        </p>
        <p>
         The data regarding the number of patients who actively engage in decision-making around CKM are limited. In one observational study from Australia, of the 721 patients with ESKD (mean age of 80 years), 65 percent were offered CKM as an option and 14 percent ultimately chose CKM [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients over the age of 85 years have a variable experience with dialysis initiation across different countries. As an example, in this age group, dialysis was initiated among 41 percent in the United States, 7 percent in Canada, and less than 5 percent in Australia and New Zealand [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-20
         </a>
         ]. Although shared-decision making may have led to some of these patients not opting for dialysis, the absence of dialysis alone does not constitute CKM. (See

         Dialysis should be framed explicitly as a treatment choice rather than a default option. CKM should be offered to all patients who may not benefit meaningfully from dialysis or whose goals focus on quality over quantity of life [

         Older patients tend to bear a greater burden of advanced multi-morbidity and frailty, and therefore, CKM becomes increasingly relevant in this population. CKM can both avoid the potential setbacks accompanying dialysis and also provide meaningful quality of life for frail patients with advanced comorbidities. Patients who choose CKM are more likely to spend their remaining survival not being hospitalized [

         The discussion regarding CKM should occur at the time of dialysis options education. For most patients, this is when the eGFR is &lt;20 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         . However, the timing of initial and subsequent discussions ultimately depends upon the individual clinical trajectory. Patients experiencing a decline in clinical health or rapid kidney function loss may benefit from earlier discussions. (See

         Important content that should be highlighted in discussions to help patients navigate the choice between dialysis and CKM includes data on survival and quality of life, as discussed above. (See

        <p>
         The conversation should involve the patient, family or caregiver, and essential members of the care team, including a nephrologist, nurse, and, when appropriate, social worker and a palliative care expert.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to elect CKM should incorporate the patient's values and priorities as well as clinical prognosis. In a small qualitative study of patients and family members, participants were more receptive to CKM when this modality was referred to as an 'active' rather than passive treatment approach [

         Care providers often struggle with these discussions. Communication frameworks and guides have been developed and applied to treatment decision making for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those who may not do well on dialysis. These tools include strategies to share patient-specific prognoses that include survival as well as quality-of-life metrics, to elicit patient goals and priorities, and to make a plan that includes what is most important to the patient [

          35

         For patients who have a favorable prognosis and preserved quality of life, treatment that focuses on longevity is reasonable. This includes medications that decelerate progression of kidney disease and medications that treat secondary complications of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). This management may also be reasonable for patients who have an unknown prognosis who desire to live as long as possible with the hope of achieving an acceptable quality of life. Thus, medical management in this scenario may be similar to that of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are awaiting the initiation of kidney replacement therapy, with modifications as outlined below.

         Treatment options that decelerate progression among patients with specific kidney diseases, such as use of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors among patients with diabetic kidney disease, can be offered to patients for whom benefits outweigh risks. Although RAAS inhibitors are beneficial in patients with CKD, most patients who receive CKM have advanced CKD or ESKD. Such patients can experience an accelerated loss of glomerular filtration rate from RAAS inhibitors, and therefore, we usually refrain from use of RAAS inhibitors even in the presence of significant proteinuria. Such patients are less likely to live long enough to experience the protective benefits and are more likely to experience worsening kidney function and hyperkalemia from these agents.

         Blood pressure (BP) control is fundamental to the care of patients with CKD to slow the progression of kidney failure and to minimize cardiovascular morbidity. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7169.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients who have chosen CKM, the goal of BP management is to avoid the short-term deleterious effects of excessively high BPs (eg, stroke or myocardial infarction), while preserving physical and cognitive function and quality of life. Target BP should be individualized by minimizing signs and symptoms of low BP (eg, falls, lightheadedness, fatigue, and cognitive impairment). Target BP is typically ≤150/90 mmHg in such patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, intensive BP lowering (ie, systolic blood pressure &lt;120 mmHg versus &lt;140 mmHg) was found to be beneficial, even among older adults over the age of 75 [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. This has led to reassessment or changes in BP management in the population. However, these data do not apply to patients who choose CKM due to the increased rate of unacceptable adverse effects, such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, syncope, and injurious falls that are likely to occur in the short-term. In addition, the life-expectancy of many patients who choose CKM is less than three years, and such patients were excluded from this study.

         Treatment of anemia can help improve symptoms of fatigue and weakness. However, as for patients with CKD and ESKD who are not managed conservatively, we do not increase ESA beyond the hemoglobin (Hb) goal of 11 g/dL. Residual symptoms of fatigue or weakness among patients with an Hb of ≥11 g/dL are unlikely to be from anemia. (See

         We generally do not avoid ESAs for patients with an Hb &lt;11 g/dL who are treated conservatively and who have an active malignancy or a history of stroke. This is because our focus is on improving and maintaining quality of life with treatment of anemia, rather than prolonging life expectancy. A risk-benefit discussion with such patients is often helpful.

         Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels do not impact decision-making within this conservative approach to care and, therefore, we do not routinely monitor PTH levels or target a specific level. Although evidence remains limited [

        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients undergoing CKM, aiming to normalize laboratory abnormalities in serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH may not be beneficial. This is because such control often comes at the cost of intense dietary restriction (eg, of protein) among patients who are already at a high risk for protein malnutrition [

         Instead, we focus treatment goals on reducing symptoms and promoting quality of life. Hyperphosphatemia may contribute to restless leg syndrome and uremic pruritus. Calcium and phosphorous deposition can lead to myalgias, arthralgias, and pseudogout. Decreased active vitamin D can lead to weakness, fatigue, and muscle loss. Hypovitaminosis D has also been associated with fracture risk in older patients [

If hyperkalemia persists despite discontinuation of culprit medications, then we treat with dietary modification and gastrointestinal cation exchangers such as

         Medications that do not address comfort should be stopped, unless their benefits will be actualized during the patient's life expectancy. Examples include but are not limited to statins and

A caregiver can complete several items on the questionnaire if the patient is too ill to participate in the evaluation.

         Pain is common, distressing, and warrants a comprehensive assessment in all patients with advanced CKD, including those being cared for conservatively. Pain may be due to concurrent comorbidities (eg, diabetic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease) or due to a secondary complication of kidney disease (eg, calciphylaxis, bone pain from renal osteodystrophy). Untreated pain can negatively impact quality of life and contribute to other symptoms such as poor sleep, anxiety, and depression.

         Possible causes of dyspnea include anxiety, anemia, infection, metabolic acidosis, and pulmonary edema. If volume overload is contributing, then sodium and fluid restriction and diuretics should be used, even at the risk of accelerating CKD progression. Nonpharmacologic interventions to relieve the sensation of breathlessness include sitting in an upright position (eg, 45 degrees), gentle air flow across the face, maintaining a humid environment, pursed lip breathing, and supplemental oxygen.

         Nonpharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting is particularly important due to the adverse effects of many of the commonly used antiemetics. Strategies, such as eating smaller, more frequent meals, eating slowly, and avoiding alcohol or foods that are greasy, spicy, or excessively sweet should be attempted. Minimizing aromas such as cooking odors, perfumes, and smoke may also help. We encourage loose fitting clothing and a relaxed, upright position after meals to facilitate digestion. Complementary therapies such as relaxation techniques or acupressure may be beneficial.

Metoclopramide should be dosed according to degree of kidney function impairment. Haloperidol and metoclopramide are dopamine antagonists and should not be prescribed together. Side effects of these agents include extrapyramidal reactions, and patients should be monitored to guide adjustments in dose or discontinuation of these medications.

         Kidney disease is a risk factor for psychological conditions such as depression and anxiety. Persistent psychological symptoms can worsen physical symptoms, negatively impact quality of life, and are associated with increased hospitalization. Conservatively managed patients face limited survival and are at risk for existential and spiritual concerns that accompany end of life.

         Crisis planning is the process of planning for future clinical setbacks, such as symptom crises, that may occur among patients who choose CKM. Crisis planning begins with advanced care planning (ACP), which is the process by which patients, family members, and providers reflect upon the patient's goals and values to help inform current and future medical care plans, including end-of-life care [

         Many patients may be asymptomatic at the time CKM is elected. When symptoms do arise, patients may respond with fear and reconsider dialysis as a "fix." These sentiments were described in a qualitative study of older patients who had elected CKM. A subset of these patients described dialysis as something they would reconsider if they "had to have it" or "got really ill" [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. Without adequate preparation, patients may view CKM as a temporary plan that may change over time, depending on their current health state and life circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite appropriate and adequate ACP and crisis management, patients may change their mind and request dialysis. This is not unexpected, as patient preferences are shaped by their experience, values, and uncertainty of the future. Some of these requests may reflect emotion, such as worries and fears of end of life. Such concerns should be explored and patients' goals of care should be readdressed. For seriously ill patients who are near the end of life, this approach may also require skills to manage conflict and consideration of palliative care consultation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95705.html" rel="external">

         The importance of crisis planning is illustrated by a systematic review of 41 observational studies including over 5100 patients who chose to not pursue dialysis. Physical well-being and overall quality of life were largely stable until late in the CKD course. However, many patients frequently used acute care services (eg, one to two hospitalizations and two emergency department visits per person-year) [

         ]. In a prospective cohort study of conservatively managed patients, the last two months of life were characterized by an increase in fatigue, pruritus, drowsiness, dyspnea, agitation, and pain. Additionally, patients and caregivers experienced high levels of psychological concerns, including personal and family anxiety, depressed mood, increased information needs, and practical concerns [

          Definition of conservative kidney management
         </strong>
         – Conservative kidney management (CKM) is a treatment option for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) that, through shared decision-making and holistic patient-centered care, emphasizes quality of life without pursuing dialysis or transplantation. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – The survival advantage conferred by dialysis, compared with CKM, is substantially reduced among patients who have cardiovascular or other severe comorbidity, and there may be no difference in survival among patients &gt;80 years. Knowledge and utilization of CKM varies globally. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Ideal candidates
         </strong>
         – Dialysis should be framed explicitly as a treatment choice rather than a default option. CKM should be offered to all patients who may not benefit meaningfully from dialysis or whose goals focus on quality over quantity of life. CKM is a treatment option for those in whom the burdens of dialysis outweigh the anticipated benefits, such as (see

         <strong>
          When to discuss
         </strong>
         – The discussion regarding CKM should occur at the time of dialysis options education. For most patients, this is when the eGFR is &lt;20 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         . The decision to elect CKM should incorporate the patient's values and priorities as well as clinical prognosis. (See

          Components of conservative kidney management

         – The CKM treatment plan is individualized for each patient. Specific interventions are chosen based upon the overall prognosis and upon patients' goals and wishes. (See

         Medical management of an individual patient's kidney disease is based upon their symptom burden from sequelae of advanced chronic kidney disease. It may include any or all of the following: treatment of hypertension, anemia, mineral-bone disease (hyperphosphatemia and hypovitaminosis D), metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. Medications that do not improve a patient's quality of life should be stopped, when possible. (See

         Crisis planning, which is the process of planning for future clinical setbacks like symptom crises, should be undertaken to avoid patients from fearfully requesting dialysis as a "fix" for their worsening symptoms. (See

         Symptom burden is usually stable among patients being cared for conservatively until the last two months before death, when there is a notable increase. At such time, patients and their family members need more involved care and monitoring by hospice and palliative care personnel. (See
