It is one of the more common causes of thrombocytopenia in otherwise asymptomatic adults.</p><p>Major diagnostic concerns in an adult with suspected ITP are twofold:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Distinguishing ITP from other causes of thrombocytopenia, which often have a similar presentation but frequently require completely different management approaches</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determining whether the ITP is primary or secondary to an underlying condition that might also benefit from treatment</p><p></p><p>The lack of a sensitive or specific diagnostic test for ITP and the large number of other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, some of which may be overlooked (eg, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, hereditary thrombocytopenia), also contribute to the challenges in diagnosing ITP.</p><p>Here we discuss the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary ITP in adults, as well as the differential diagnosis of ITP and causes of secondary ITP due to other conditions.</p><p>Other issues are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other causes of thrombocytopenia</strong> – Other common causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, chronic liver disease or hypersplenism, and bone marrow suppression or transient drops in platelet count from an infection. Hereditary thrombocytopenias are less common but may be mistakenly diagnosed as ITP when first identified during adulthood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6680.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6674.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> – ITP is often seen in otherwise healthy women, many of whom may have a platelet count first checked during pregnancy. However, pregnancy is also associated with other causes of thrombocytopenia including gestational thrombocytopenia (a physiologic condition) and pregnancy-associated microangiopathic syndromes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6681.html" rel="external">"Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children</strong> – ITP in children, especially in children younger than age 10, is a clinically distinct condition from that in adults, with a higher likelihood of spontaneous remission, a lower incidence of underlying diseases and comorbidities, and often a lower risk of bleeding. During adolescence, ITP may be similar to typical childhood ITP or to ITP in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5930.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Treatment of ITP depends on the estimated risk of bleeding.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6677.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults", section on 'Definitions of bleeding severity'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary ITP</strong> – Primary ITP is acquired immune thrombocytopenia due to autoimmune mechanisms leading to platelet destruction and platelet underproduction that is not triggered by an apparent associated condition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary ITP</strong> – Secondary ITP is ITP associated with another condition such as those listed below (see <a class="local">'Inciting events'</a> below). By convention, the associated condition is noted in parentheses, as in "secondary ITP (lupus-associated)."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia</strong> – Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) is thrombocytopenia due to drug-dependent platelet antibodies that cause platelet destruction. This syndrome should be distinguished from drug-induced bone marrow suppression, a non-immune phenomenon (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73618" href="/z/d/graphic/73618.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6674.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The time elapsed since diagnosis determines whether ITP is referred to as newly diagnosed, persistent, or chronic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Newly diagnosed</strong> – Up to three months since diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Persistent</strong> – Three to 12 months since diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Chronic</strong> – More than 12 months since diagnosis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe ITP</strong> – Severe ITP refers to ITP with bleeding symptoms sufficient to require treatment; this typically occurs when platelet counts are below 20,000/microL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other names for ITP</strong> – ITP has previously been called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, or autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP). These terms have been replaced by "immune thrombocytopenia" to reflect the known autoantibody mechanism and the absence of purpura in most patients. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of ITP is incompletely understood. Genetic predisposition has been explored, although only a very small number (2 percent) of individuals have a familial ITP syndrome [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>Reduced platelet lifespan due to clearance is the predominant cause of thrombocytopenia. (See <a class="local">'Platelet destruction'</a> below.)</p><p>The principal mechanism is thought to involve specific autoantibodies (typically, IgG), most often directed against platelet membrane glycoproteins such as GPIIb/IIIa [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>]. Further discussion of autoantibody formation is provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5579.html" rel="external">"Overview of autoimmunity"</a>.)</p><p>Other mechanisms are likely to play a role as well, including autoreactive cytotoxic T cells, as well as humoral and cellular autoimmunity directed at megakaryocytes, causing impaired platelet production. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Inciting events</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In some patients with ITP, there may appear to be inciting events. Genetic and acquired factors may contribute [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary ITP</strong> – Causes of secondary ITP in adults include a number of chronic disorders and infectious diseases that are summarized in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef123101" href="/z/d/graphic/123101.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Examples include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Common variable immune deficiency (CVID)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Selective immunoglobulin (Ig) A deficiency</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><em>Helicobacter pylori </em>infection</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HIV infection</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>COVID-19 vaccines</strong> – Cases of ITP have been reported, including new-onset ITP and exacerbation of existing ITP, in individuals who have received a COVID-19 vaccine; however, there is no evidence to suggest that individuals who receive any of the COVID-19 vaccines have a higher rate of ITP than the background rate in the population. Details are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6677.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults", section on 'COVID-19 vaccination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In contrast, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is pathophysiologically and clinically more similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) than to ITP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131333.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>These inciting events can be categorized broadly into two main mechanisms: infections (typically viral) and systemic conditions that disrupt immune homeostasis (eg, autoimmune disease, lymphoid malignancy).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection</strong> – Some cases of ITP are associated with a preceding viral infection or, less commonly, bacterial infection. Antibodies against viral antigens may cross-react with normal platelet antigens (a form of molecular mimicry). Infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have been proposed to cause secondary ITP by this mechanism [<a href="#rid12">12-15</a>]. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide, may attach to platelet surfaces and can increase platelet phagocytosis [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection may contribute to the development of ITP in some cases by an unknown mechanism that might include molecular mimicry, immune alterations, and activities of bacterial products such as cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Zika virus infection can cause secondary ITP. In a series of 37,878 individuals with Zika virus infection, 47 (0.1 percent) had thrombocytopenia without another cause, often severe [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Of the 12 who had platelet counts &lt;50,000/microL, all had bleeding manifestations, most commonly petechiae and hematuria; there was one intracranial hemorrhage. Several of these individuals had an excellent platelet count response to ITP therapies (glucocorticoids alone, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> alone, or both in combination). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106169.html" rel="external">"Zika virus infection: An overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune alteration</strong> – Alterations in immune homeostasis might induce loss of peripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reactive antibodies. This often occurs in the setting of other autoimmune conditions including the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Evans syndrome, hematopoietic cell transplantation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders (especially those treated with purine analogs), common variable immunodeficiency, and the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [<a href="#rid8">8,19,20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alternative immunologic mechanisms involving T cells have also been postulated to cause ITP, including T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and defects in the number and/or function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [<a href="#rid21">21-30</a>]. The latter mechanism is supported by a study showing a reduced number and defective suppressive capacity of Tregs in patients with ITP versus controls and restored Treg numbers and regulatory function, especially in responders, following treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3980.html" rel="external">"The adaptive cellular immune response: T cells and cytokines", section on 'Suppression'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In contrast to ITP associated with lymphoid malignancies such as CLL, reports of ITP in association with nonhematologic malignancies, especially breast cancer, are likely due to coincidence rather than a causal relationship [<a href="#rid31">31-34</a>].</p><p></p><p>Details of testing and the association with ITP are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4504.html" rel="external">"Overview of the complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia", section on 'Immune thrombocytopenia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4670.html" rel="external">"Hematologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Thrombocytopenia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16837.html" rel="external">"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3676.html" rel="external">"Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Antibody production</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antibody production in ITP appears to be driven by CD4-positive helper T cells reacting to platelet surface glycoproteins, possibly involving CD40:CD40L co-stimulation [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>]. Splenic macrophages appear to be the major antigen-presenting cells [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. </p><p>Despite this likely mechanism, antiplatelet antibodies are not demonstrable in close to 50 percent of patients with ITP (ie, sensitivity of antiplatelet antibodies is low) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Thus, we do not use assays for antiplatelet antibodies in ITP diagnosis or management [<a href="#rid3">3,40-42</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Antiplatelet antibody testing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93446"><span class="h2">Platelet destruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary site of platelet clearance for most patients is the spleen, which removes opsonized (antibody coated) cells including platelets. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults", section on 'Properties of the normal spleen'</a>.)</p><p>The prominent role of splenic clearance explains the effectiveness of splenectomy in most patients. However, clearance may occur in other tissues as well, such as the liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and accessory splenic tissue. This helps explain why ITP can persist or recur post-splenectomy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6678.html" rel="external">"Second-line and subsequent therapies for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults", section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ITP is a common acquired bleeding disorder (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78231" href="/z/d/graphic/78231.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The reported incidence appeared to increase with the introduction of automated platelet counting in the 1970s; however, this was likely due to an increase in the incidental finding of thrombocytopenia rather than a true increase in the incidence of ITP [<a href="#rid43">43,44</a>].</p><p>A review of published reports determined an annual ITP incidence of approximately 1 to 6 per 100,000 adults in the era of routine complete blood counts; this estimate is based on three large retrospective studies from Europe and a study from Korea [<a href="#rid43">43-47</a>]. ITP is often a chronic disease in adults; thus, the prevalence significantly exceeds the incidence. In a review from the United States, prevalence was approximately 8 per 100,000 in children and 12 per 100,000 in adults [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p>Other studies have estimated that one-fifth to one-third of individuals with ITP will be asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis (ie, diagnosed because of an incidental finding of thrombocytopenia); thus, the incidence of symptomatic disease is likely to be much lower [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. In a database review from the French National Health Insurance System that was limited to ITP cases requiring chronic therapy and/or hospitalization, the overall incidence was 2.9 per 100,000 person-years, with a peak in individuals &gt;60 years, reaching 9 cases per 100,000 person-years in men &gt;75 years of age [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. </p><p>Other studies have also documented the increasing incidence of ITP with increasing age [<a href="#rid46">46,51</a>]. Over time, there is a greater likelihood of having a lower platelet count; in a series of 269 individuals with ITP, 152 (57 percent) had a platelet count &lt;20,000/microL at some point during their disease course [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p>ITP is generally thought to be a condition that affects young women. Some studies have corroborated a female predominance in younger adults, while others have not [<a href="#rid43">43,46,49</a>]. Most studies show a similar incidence in males and females over the age of 60 years.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With wide availability of complete blood counts (CBCs), many patients with ITP are diagnosed as a result of chronic, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia. For patients with symptoms, these are primarily related to thrombocytopenia and bleeding, but patients can also experience fatigue and decreased quality of life.

The rate of bleeding in patients seen and followed in specialty clinics will be higher than that in a group of patients detected as a result of CBCs performed for other reasons and identified as having thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the rates of bleeding reported from expert clinics probably represent an overestimate of the actual bleeding risk in the general ITP population, while the bleeding risk determined from asymptomatic, screening detected individuals likely underestimates that of patients who are being evaluated because they have signs or symptoms of ITP. </p><p>Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia may ultimately occur in up to two-thirds of patients.

In contrast, vasculitic purpura, which is due to capillary inflammation, is palpable and does not accumulate in dependent areas.

This was illustrated in a systematic review of prospective clinical studies, which included 5336 adults with primary ITP [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. The proportion of adults with bleeding was as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>ICH – 1.4 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Non-ICH severe bleeding – 9.6 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Reported rates of bleeding are variable, depending on the population, the definition of bleeding, and the methods of reporting.

In a prospective registry that included 269 patients with ITP, 152 (57 percent) had bleeding occurrences, most of which were localized to the skin or mouth [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

As a result, bleeding manifestations in patients with ITP tend to be less severe at equivalent platelet counts than in patients with thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow suppression.</p><p>Because the risk of clinically important bleeding is low with platelet counts &gt;20,000/microL, we generally do not use therapies to increase the platelet count in individuals with a stable platelet count &gt;20,000/microL unless there are other comorbidities or medications that increase bleeding risk; this is consistent with a guideline from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].

Within the ITP group, scores were not dramatically different in those taking medications compared with those not taking medications.

Unlike ITP, DITP is induced and/or perpetuated by the presence of a drug or other ingested substance (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9847" href="/z/d/drug information/9847.html" rel="external">quinine</a>, walnuts) and is expected to resolve upon drug discontinuation. Details of the evaluation of possible DITP are presented separately. Many drugs have been reported to be associated with the development of DITP, which may be due to the active ingredient, excipients or the dye used in the tablets. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6674.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>HIT</strong> – Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a form of drug-induced thrombocytopenia associated with the potential for arterial and venous thrombosis, which can be potentially life-threatening. The characteristic temporal exposure to heparin, clinical findings, diagnosis, and management of HIT are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1369.html" rel="external">"Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>DITMA</strong> – Certain medications (cancer therapies, immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics), drugs, and substances, including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9847" href="/z/d/drug information/9847.html" rel="external">quinine</a> and drugs of abuse, may cause thrombocytopenia as a component of a drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (DITMA). Unlike ITP, DITMA is associated with hemolytic anemia; sometimes DITMA is accompanied by signs or symptoms of systemic disease and/or organ involvement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98720.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (DITMA)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infections</strong> – A variety of infections can cause thrombocytopenia by a variety of non-immune mechanisms including bone marrow suppression, hypersplenism, and platelet consumption. In addition, acute infections can cause an immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, in which case patients typically recall an acute symptomatic period with fever, rash, and/or constitutional symptoms. The thrombocytopenia associated with self-limited infections is typically transient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6680.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to thrombocytopenia in adults", section on 'Infection or fever'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Chronic infections with HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) often cause thrombocytopenia, in some cases as a form of secondary ITP and in other cases by non-immune mechanisms (eg, bone marrow suppression, hypersplenism). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3676.html" rel="external">"Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Liver disease and hypersplenism</strong> – Liver disease and/or other causes of hypersplenism frequently cause mild thrombocytopenia by pooling of platelets in the spleen. Cirrhosis can also cause decreased levels of thrombopoietin, which contributes to thrombocytopenia. Unlike ITP, patients typically have elevations in transaminases and may have a palpable liver or spleen; however, hepatosplenomegaly may be difficult to appreciate in some patients. In severe cases of liver disease, patients may also have coagulation abnormalities, which are absent in ITP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Microangiopathic processes</strong> – Microangiopathic processes include hereditary and acquired conditions associated with diffuse microvascular coagulation and/or thrombosis; these processes cause thrombocytopenia from platelet consumption in thrombi. Examples include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Like ITP, these conditions cause thrombocytopenia and sometimes bleeding. Unlike ITP, TTP, HUS, and DIC are associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (eg, schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear); DIC is also associated with coagulation abnormalities. Unlike individuals with ITP, who are otherwise well, patients with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are often quite ill. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88648.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hereditary thrombocytopenia</strong> – A variety of hereditary thrombocytopenias have mild clinical phenotypes and only present during adulthood when there is a hemostatic challenge (eg, trauma, surgery) or a routine platelet count is measured. Like ITP, these disorders may be characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia with mild or no clinical bleeding. Unlike ITP, these conditions may have morphologic abnormalities of platelets on the peripheral blood smear. Examples include giant platelets (the size of red blood cells) in May-Hegglin anomaly or Bernard-Soulier syndrome, or an absence of platelet granules in gray platelet syndrome. Some individuals may also have other characteristic clinical features associated with inherited syndromes; these are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4979.html" rel="external">"Neonatal thrombocytopenia: Etiology", section on 'Genetic disorders'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">"Inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs)", section on 'Specific disorders'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited condition primarily due to mutations in the von Willebrand factor gene; the primary effect is impaired platelet adhesion to sites of injury and reduced factor VIII levels. However, patients with the type 2B subtype of VWD may also have mild thrombocytopenia. In patients with type 2B VWD, bleeding severity may be out of proportion to the platelet count, there may be a positive family history, and laboratory testing will reveal characteristic reduced ristocetin cofactor activity with a decrease in high molecular weight von Willebrand factor multimers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1309.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of von Willebrand disease"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myelodysplastic syndromes</strong> – Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are acquired bone marrow disorders associated with impaired hematopoiesis and a risk of progression to leukemia. Unlike ITP, these syndromes are typically progressive and often associated with other cytopenias (eg, anemia, leukopenia) as well as dysplastic cells and/or increased numbers of immature cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Rarely, however, MDS may present with isolated thrombocytopenia; this finding is most often seen in those with an isolated deletion in the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4492.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and classification of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</strong> – Acquired pure megakaryocytic aplasia (amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia) is a rare condition in which antibodies to the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor on megakaryocytes (platelet precursor cells in the bone marrow) cause very severe thrombocytopenia. Like ITP, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is associated with isolated thrombocytopenia. Unlike ITP, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia shows decreased or absent bone marrow megakaryocytes.  </p><p></p><p>A more comprehensive overview of our approach to determining the cause of thrombocytopenia in an adult is presented in detail separately.

(See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> – ITP is a common acquired bleeding disorder (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78231" href="/z/d/graphic/78231.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). ITP is often a chronic disease in adults; thus, the prevalence (approximately 12 per 100,000 adults) exceeds the incidence. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical findings </strong>– The clinical manifestations of ITP are mostly related to bleeding; fatigue occurs in some patients. Bleeding may occur in up to two-thirds of patients; however, many are asymptomatic. Serious bleeding is seen most often in individuals with platelet counts &lt;20,000/microL, but the overall correlation between bleeding and the platelet count is weak. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The diagnosis of ITP requires that other causes of thrombocytopenia be eliminated. Many potential causes are obvious from the history, physical examination, and review of the complete blood count (CBC) (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77063" href="/z/d/graphic/77063.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). However, thrombocytopenia caused by a medication, beverage, or food may require specific questioning (or review of the hospital record) to elicit the responsible agent (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73618" href="/z/d/graphic/73618.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60296" href="/z/d/graphic/60296.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). For patients with presumed ITP who have severe bleeding, urgent hospitalization with early involvement of the consulting hematologist is appropriate; however, many cases of ITP can be safely diagnosed and managed without hospital admission. (See <a class="local">'Preliminary evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Post-diagnostic testing</strong> – Once other obvious conditions have been excluded, few remaining diagnostic studies are needed. We review the peripheral blood smear (or request review) and test all patients for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited role of bone marrow and other tests</strong> – Additional laboratory testing reserved for selected patients may include coagulation studies, transaminase measurements, rheumatologic testing, and bone marrow examination. Bone marrow examination should be confined to patients with a suspected bone marrow disorder, rather than as a test for ITP. (See <a class="local">'Additional testing in selected patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – We make a presumptive diagnosis of primary ITP when the evaluation does not reveal other potential etiologies for thrombocytopenia. We make a presumptive diagnosis of secondary ITP in a patient with ITP and an underlying associated condition such as those listed in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef123101" href="/z/d/graphic/123101.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential</strong> – The differential diagnosis of ITP includes a variety of inherited and acquired conditions such as drug-induced thrombocytopenia, infections, liver disease and hypersplenism; microangiopathic processes; congenital thrombocytopenic conditions; and bone marrow disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
