         Most head and neck cancers begin in the mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract, and these are predominantly squamous cell carcinomas.

         An overview of treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas will be presented here. An overview of the diagnostic approach and staging of head and neck cancers is presented separately. (See

         A multidisciplinary approach is required for optimal decision making, treatment planning, and posttreatment response assessment. This should include surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists, as well as dentists, speech/swallowing pathologists, dieticians, psychosocial oncology, prosthodontists, and rehabilitation therapists. Specifically, a multidisciplinary tumor board affects diagnostic and treatment decisions in a significant number of patients with newly diagnosed head and neck tumors [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. Whenever possible, complex cases of head and neck cancer should be treated at high-volume centers of excellence with expertise in these disciplines since most studies suggest improved outcomes with this approach [

         Approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas present with stage I or II (early stage) disease. In general, these patients are treated with either primary surgery or definitive radiation therapy (RT). Patients with carcinoma in situ usually are managed surgically in the same way as those with T1 disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Five-year overall survival in patients with stage I or II disease is typically from 70 to 90 percent. Careful observation and follow-up after initial treatment are required both to detect a potentially curable recurrence and to identify and treat second primary tumors. Particularly in patients with tobacco- and alcohol-related head and neck cancers, there is a substantial increase in the risk of a second head and neck cancer, as well as of a second primary arising in the lung. Smoking cessation should be pursued in smokers. (See

         RT and surgery result in similar rates of local control and survival for many sites; the choice of therapy is typically based upon the specific site and its requirements, the surgical accessibility of the tumor, and the functional outcomes and morbidity associated with each modality. Oral cavity cancers are a notable exception and are usually best treated with surgery, based upon generally better cure rates and toxicity profile compared with radiation-based therapy. External beam RT may be an may be an option for oral cavity tumors, especially if surgical expertise is not available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditional surgical approaches through skin incisions to gain access to the primary (ie, wide local excision) are usually used for salivary and thyroid cancers, which are easily accessible. At other sites, minimally invasive techniques, such as transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM) for larynx and hypopharynx cancers and transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharynx cancers, have improved transoral access. These approaches can improve functional outcomes and decrease morbidity compared with standard surgical approaches. Most early stage oral cavity cancers can be treated through a transoral approach.

         Definitive RT is administered using external beam RT, and requires a three-dimensional conformal technique. Highly conformal RT techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), are the standard of care since they have demonstrated reduced morbidity.

        <p>
         For patients initially treated with surgery for clinically early stage cancers, postoperative RT, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, is indicated for those that are pathologically locoregionally advanced and have close or positive margins and other factors that increase the risk of local recurrence, including perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and extranodal extension. The finding of multiple lymph nodes on elective lymph node dissection in the clinically N0 patient is likewise an indication for RT. (See

         Locoregionally advanced (stage III/IV) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is associated with a high risk of both local recurrence and distant metastases. Combined modality approaches (surgery, RT, and/or chemotherapy) are generally required to optimize the chances for long-term disease control [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. These combined modality approaches include primary surgery followed by either postoperative RT or concurrent chemoradiotherapy, induction chemotherapy (the addition of chemotherapy prior to surgery and/or RT), concurrent chemoradiotherapy without surgery, and sequential therapy (induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy) without surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Decisions about the optimal sequencing and selection of surgery, RT, and/or chemotherapy require multidisciplinary input. Key factors to consider include the primary tumor site and disease extent, the individual patient factors (age, comorbidity, preferences regarding treatment type), and the likely functional consequences and morbidity of each treatment approach. The choice of therapy should also take into account the experience and technology available at the patient's medical institution.

         – Surgery is generally preferred for locoregionally advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas since most cases are easily accessible, and simultaneous resection and reconstruction can be accomplished with acceptable functional outcomes.

         Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas frequently metastasize to the cervical lymph nodes, which is associated with a negative prognosis for most patients. Consequently, treatment of the cervical neck nodes, even if involvement is clinically occult, is often part of the treatment strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas who have cervical lymph node involvement at presentation and are treated with definitive RT or chemoradiotherapy, residual abnormalities in the neck are managed differently depending on response to initial treatment. For patients with complete regression, as documented clinically and by structural (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and functional (positron emission tomography [PET]) imaging, observation is generally indicated, whereas salvage surgery is indicated in the absence of an adequate response  (

         The risk of developing nodal metastases varies by primary tumor site and factors such as size, histology, tumor thickness, and perineural invasion. When the probability of occult metastases exceeds 15 to 20 percent, the risk of neck recurrence without elective (prophylactic) treatment is sufficiently high to outweigh the morbidity of neck dissection and/or (chemo)irradiation.

         Every effort is made to provide functional reconstruction during the ablative surgery, with the goals of restoration of orofacial functions, including deglutition, control of secretions, mastication, and phonetics, and to aesthetically replace the missing orofacial structures. Primary reconstruction of maxillary, palatal, tongue, and mandibular defects is the current standard of care. Local flaps can be utilized for smaller defects, such as the submental island flap. Free tissue transfer, such as radial forearm free flap or fibula osteocutaneous free flap, can be used for larger or more complex defects. (See

         The toxicity associated with treatment for head and neck cancer (whether surgery, RT, and/or chemotherapy) is substantial, and every effort should be made to minimize side effects and treat these complications. Surgery may alter form and function, while acute effects of RT or chemoradiation treatment include skin reaction, mucositis, function alteration and dysphagia, fatigue, and weight loss. Delayed toxicity can have a significant effect on quality of life. Long-term side effects of RT or chemoradiation, such as dry mouth, severe dysphagia, osteoradionecrosis, aspiration pneumonia, or radiation fibrosis syndrome, are directly related to radiation dose [

         Regular posttreatment follow-up is an essential part of the care of patients after potentially curative treatment of head and neck cancer. Patients should be educated about the possible signs and symptoms of a second primary cancer and locoregional recurrence, including hoarseness, pain, dysphagia, bleeding, and enlarged lymph nodes. Consistent with the standards of the Commission on Cancer for those treated with curative intent, a survivorship care plan and treatment summary should be generated and reviewed in detail with the patient within six months of completion of therapy, and a copy should be shared with the patient and primary care physician.

         Imaging should not be performed too soon. Obtaining imaging studies, particularly PET/CT, prior to 12 weeks following treatment can lead to an increased frequency of false-positive results.

         However, lifetime follow-up is required since the morbidity of treatment can worsen over time, and the risk of recurrence and second primary malignancy remains beyond the first five years. Because of the higher risk of recurrence and second primary malignancy, as well as other late toxicities, in those who continue tobacco use, many experts schedule more frequent surveillance visits for these patients.

         All patients with locoregionally recurrent disease should be evaluated for distant metastases prior to initiating retreatment. Those with a good performance status and whose disease is confined to the head and neck may benefit from surgical salvage, and/or radiation or reirradiation, systemic therapy (eg, chemotherapy and immunotherapy), or clinical trial participation, although treatment options are limited by the previous treatment received.

         ). HPV associated cancers have increased dramatically and have substantially altered the epidemiology of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. These tumors define a distinct subset of patients who have frequent lymph node involvement and an improved prognosis compared with HPV negative, tobacco-driven oropharynx cancers.
        </p>

         A revised classification/staging system has been implemented as of January 2018 for HPV related oropharyngeal cancers in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth edition staging manual [

         new system recategorizes many of the patients previously staged as IVA to stage I, II, or III with much better prognostic accuracy; the therapeutic approach for patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer has not changed. Because of the better prognosis for patients with HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer, clinical trials that include deintensification of treatment are underway to define the optimal approach for these patients, with the goal of maximizing long-term cure rates while minimizing toxicity. Currently, however, the approach to these patients outside of a clinical trial setting is the same as for patients with oropharyngeal cancer not associated with HPV. (See

         Radiation therapy (RT) is the mainstay of treatment for locoregional nasopharyngeal cancer, but the integration of chemotherapy has been instrumental in improving survival for most stage II and advanced-stage disease (III and IV). Surgery is not typically used because of the deep anatomical location of the nasopharynx and its close proximity to critical neurovascular structures and the base of skull. (See

         Tumors of the nasal vestibule are essentially skin cancers and are treated with surgery and/or RT, depending on the size and location within the nasal vestibule.

         Salivary gland tumors consist of a wide array of benign and malignant histologies that occur in salivary gland tissue throughout the head and neck. Surgical resection of the salivary gland is important for both diagnosis and treatment. Patients with benign and low-grade tumors are typically treated with surgery alone, whereas patients with high-grade carcinomas and other high-risk features are usually treated with surgery and postoperative RT.
