Such pain may result from the residual effects of past trauma or nontraumatic conditions. Generally, we define chronic conditions are those that have been present for longer than three months, acute conditions as those present for less than two weeks, and subacute conditions as those present for two weeks to three months.</p><p>The common causes of chronic wrist pain and an approach to diagnosing these problems is provided here. Acute wrist pain, wrist anatomy and biomechanics, and more detailed discussions of specific wrist problems are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/245.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/196.html" rel="external">"Overview of carpal fractures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/219.html" rel="external">"Distal radius fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/197.html" rel="external">"Scaphoid fractures"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1788917"><span class="h1">ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The anatomy and biomechanics of the wrist are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83994.html" rel="external">"Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59023274"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES AND OVERALL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Using information from the history, key symptoms, and findings from the basic wrist examination, the clinician can usually select one of three common diagnostic categories that best fits the patient. The following flow chart provides an overview of our approach to wrist pain diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129676" href="/d/graphic/129676.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The three major categories of wrist pain are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute wrist pain, either from trauma or associated with overuse (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/245.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic wrist pain </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wrist pain without trauma or overuse, possibly associated with systemic symptoms (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/245.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain", section on 'Wrist pain not associated with trauma or overuse'</a>)</p><p></p><p>The first important distinction to make when establishing the diagnostic category is whether the pain is acute or chronic. Chronic pain is typically defined as pain that has persisted for approximately three months or longer. Keep in mind that acute pain may reflect an exacerbation of a chronic condition. Once a major diagnostic category is identified, the next step is to determine the region of the wrist that is affected, and then the precise diagnosis. </p><p>The following sections of this topic provide information and guidance about how to work through the common and important diagnoses within the category of <strong>chronic</strong><em> </em>or<em> </em><strong>subacute</strong> wrist pain. While inspection, range of motion, and basic strength and neurovascular testing are typically performed in every patient with wrist pain, provided excessive pain does not preclude such examination, the clinician determines which specific structures warrant more thorough evaluation, including which special wrist examination maneuvers to perform, based upon the most likely diagnostic category.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769484"><span class="h1">HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obtaining a thorough history is important for determining the source of chronic wrist pain. The history is taken in an orderly sequence and should emphasize questions that have the greatest clinical relevance. When evaluating chronic wrist pain, the following questions are of particular importance:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is the pain associated with any systemic features (eg, fever, night sweats)? Does pain occur in both wrists or in other joints in addition to the wrist? </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presence of systemic features or pain in both wrists or additional joints suggests that the pain may stem from a systemic illness. Such presentations warrant a thorough evaluation and are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/245.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain", section on 'Wrist pain not associated with trauma or overuse'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>What is the patient’s age?</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis are more likely to be seen in an older patient. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Did pain begin following trauma?</strong> <strong>If so, what was the mechanism of injury?</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Wrist injuries can be missed during an initial evaluation. As examples, a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH) may lead to injuries that are missed initially, including scaphoid fracture, lunate dislocation, or scapholunate dissociation. If the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident, the impact of the wrist on the steering wheel may have injured the carpal ligaments. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/197.html" rel="external">"Scaphoid fractures"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Which is the patient’s dominant hand?</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The dominant hand is more likely to be injured, and the functional loss usually is greater.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Where on the wrist is the patient experiencing symptoms?</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Have the patient point to the site of greatest discomfort, or allow them to determine if symptoms are spread over generalized wider area. Although the degree of pain is subjective, the location of symptoms can help to narrow the differential diagnosis. As examples, pain from a ligamentous disruption is typically localized, whereas a condition involving nerve compression creates more diffuse symptoms (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome creates pain and paresthesias along the volar surface of the wrist and thenar region). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>What exact movements or activities elicit pain?</strong> Also, what movements or activities (including rest) relieve the pain?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Any movement that elicits or increases pain should be among the last things tested by the clinician. Premature testing can lead to guarding by the patient and limit the usefulness of the rest of the examination. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Describe the pain?</strong> Is it cramping, dull, aching, sharp, shooting, severe, or diffuse? </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pain caused by direct injury to a nerve tends to be sharp and burning, and travel along the nerve’s distribution. Pain caused by a fracture is usually deep, boring, and fairly constant. Pain from a ligamentous injury often waxes and wanes depending upon activity. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Has this condition (or constellation of symptoms) occurred before?</strong> What treatments were used to alleviate the condition? </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some recurring conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, may warrant surgical referral. As another example, the patient with a wrist ganglion that has been aspirated several times before may need a surgical referral for more definitive treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>What is the patient’s occupation? </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Many occupational and recreational activities can affect wrist function. As examples, prolonged typing and working with machinery may involve repetitive motion that produces wrist pain, while other hobbies, such as knitting or sewing, can produce a compressive neuropathy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>What does the patient do for sport or recreation?</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">More specifically one might ask, what position on a sports team do they play? Such sport-specific information can help the clinician to determine if a wrist injury stems from repetitive stress or from direct trauma. Contact sports, such as American football or rugby, may involve wrist trauma, while noncontact sports, such as golf and tennis, involve repetitive stress of the wrist. American football lineman and defensive backs often jam opponents with their extended arms while their wrist is held in dorsiflexion with their palms open. Such repetitive trauma can lead to chronic dorsal wrist pain. Platform divers may have similar dorsal wrist complaints as well as thumb pain from the repeated impact on their hands as they enter the water. Field hockey players are at risk for wrist injury because they constantly hit a hard ball without protective gloves. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With tennis players, it is helpful to ask what type of grip they use and whether they recently changed their grip. Many players select a relatively small racquet grip size because they feel this gives them greater control. However, this can be harmful because the smaller the grip the tighter the player must squeeze the racquet to maintain control during impact, and the resulting chronic overexertion of the hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow can lead to tendinopathy, most often at the origin of the wrist flexors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/248.html" rel="external">"Elbow tendinopathy (tennis and golf elbow)"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Wrist injuries in golfers generally occur from overuse and involve the flexor or extensor tendons. Such overuse syndromes are typically amenable to treatment with physical therapy, but may require the patient to abstain from golf for a period of time. Many of these wrist problems stem from one of the following causes: a strong grip (left hand positioned clockwise on the golf club handle), over-gripping (ie, too tight a grip), golf club grips in poor repair, or poor swing technique. Among golfers, the most common bony injury of the wrist is fracture of the hook of the hamate. This injury is a source of chronic ulnar-sided wrist pain and is often diagnosed late or goes undiagnosed [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the pain interfere with the patient’s work?</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In cases of work-related pain, including disability issues, it is important to obtain a detailed history of any injury or repetitive activity, including the mechanism of any injury, the duration of any repetitive activity both on a daily basis and overall (ie, cumulative performance), and the pattern of symptom progression. Imaging studies are usually required to complete the data collection and may be necessary to determine the affect of wrist symptoms upon the capacity to work. Obtaining as much objective data as possible, including a careful history, physical examination, and radiographic studies, is helpful when secondary gain may be an issue (eg, cases of workman’s compensation or litigation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inquire about past medical and surgical conditions, family history, and medications.</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Systemic and local disease can manifest with wrist pain. Examples include median neuropathy from diabetes and joint pain from gout.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769499"><span class="h1">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examination of the wrist is performed systematically, and includes inspection, palpation, range of motion, and relevant special tests [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The history and initial examination findings determine which special tests should be performed. In all cases, a screening neurovascular assessment of the involved extremity should be performed. </p><p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ushered in an increased use of telemedicine for musculoskeletal evaluation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Using telemedicine, clinicians can perform an assessment of the hand and wrist, including inspection, motor function, sensation, and some specialized testing [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. While they cannot replicate all aspects of a thorough, in-person examination, telemedicine assessments are a viable option in some circumstances.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769507"><span class="h2">Inspection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inspection begins by looking at the patient’s willingness and ability to use the hand. Comparison with the surface anatomy of the unaffected side may reveal obvious deformities or subtle differences in appearance. Pay special attention to the loss of normal contours, as may occur with swelling or muscle atrophy. Inspect the skin for pallor, surgical scars, bruising, erythema, or other lesions. These may provide clues about systemic illness, associated conditions, or injuries. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dorsal aspect – Inspect the dorsal aspect of the wrist with the patient’s forearm pronated. The most prominent bony landmark of the dorsal wrist is the head of the distal ulna  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359" href="/d/graphic/78359.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86693" href="/d/graphic/86693.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Diffuse swelling over the dorsum of the wrist is common in rheumatoid arthritis. Diffuse swelling following trauma raises suspicion for a fracture or ligamentous injury. Because the metacarpals are subcutaneous, angulation associated with fractures is usually visible. A localized spherical mass is most often a ganglion cyst. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/219.html" rel="external">"Distal radius fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7761.html" rel="external">"Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand", section on 'Definition'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radial (lateral) aspect – Inspect the radial aspect of the wrist starting distally at the base of the first metacarpal and working proximally to the distal radius  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56302" href="/d/graphic/56302.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86702" href="/d/graphic/86702.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Look for a hollow depression, known as the “anatomic snuffbox,” which is bound by the first and third dorsal wrist compartments  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82858" href="/d/graphic/82858.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82859" href="/d/graphic/82859.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). The scaphoid resides within the anatomic snuffbox. Observe the contours of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and carpometacarpal (CMC) joints to see if they are smooth; excessive “squaring” suggests degenerative joint disease. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Volar (palmar) aspect – The visible flexion crease where the hand joins the forearm marks the proximal limit of the flexor retinaculum (transverse carpal ligament)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69097" href="/d/graphic/69097.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86694" href="/d/graphic/86694.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). The palmaris longus tendon is present in 80 percent of individuals and runs parallel and ulnar to the flexor carpi radialis tendon. The median nerve travels below the depression between the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi radialis tendons. The clinician should note any atrophy of the thenar eminence, which may indicate median nerve entrapment seen with carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ulnar (medial) aspect – The ulnar aspect of the wrist is most easily inspected by having the patient flex the elbow until the ulnar surface faces the examiner. The location of the head of the ulna, hypothenar eminence, and fifth metacarpal should be easily visualized  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86701" href="/d/graphic/86701.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Atrophy of the hypothenar eminence may indicate entrapment or injury of the ulnar nerve.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769514"><span class="h2">Palpation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians with a good understanding of surface anatomy can palpate the carpal bones individually  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51990" href="/d/graphic/51990.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70211" href="/d/graphic/70211.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Scaphoid – To palpate the scaphoid, place your thumb in the anatomic snuffbox and move the index finger to the proximal thenar eminence such that the patient’s scaphoid is between the index finger and thumb  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82858" href="/d/graphic/82858.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82859" href="/d/graphic/82859.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). Focal tenderness at the snuffbox following trauma suggests scaphoid injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/197.html" rel="external">"Scaphoid fractures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lunate – The lunate can be palpated on the dorsum of the wrist just distal to the radius  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112636" href="/d/graphic/112636.html" rel="external">picture 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86693" href="/d/graphic/86693.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118079" href="/d/graphic/118079.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). Palpate Lister’s Tubercle with your thumb, and then slide your thumb distally to the proximal carpal row in line with the middle finger to find the lunate. The lunate becomes more prominent with volar flexion of the wrist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Triquetrum – The triquetrum can be appreciated on the dorsum of the wrist, just distal to the ulnar prominence  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108160" href="/d/graphic/108160.html" rel="external">picture 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118079" href="/d/graphic/118079.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pisiform – The pisiform is palpated on the volar aspect of the hand  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107905" href="/d/graphic/107905.html" rel="external">picture 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86694" href="/d/graphic/86694.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>).

The ECU tendon sheath can be irritated by repetitive flexion and extension of the wrist while it is held in supination. Pain most commonly develops where the tendon bends as it exits the fibro-osseous tunnel on the ulna. ECU tendinopathy is common among people who play racquet sports or golf, as well as those who frequently use a computer mouse or keyboard with their wrist poorly positioned (eg, in excessive dorsiflexion) [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. Computer keyboards placed too low or too high can contribute to these problems. During the wrist examination, the clinician can often reproduce tendinopathy pain by performing the ECU synergy test. (See <a class="local">'Special tests'</a> above.)</p><p>Mild cases of ECU tendinopathy can be treated with rest, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and immobilization in a wrist splint that restricts radial and ulnar deviation for approximately four weeks. Severe cases may be treated with glucocorticoid injection or surgery to repair the tendon and its sheath. Patients must be warned about the possibility of tendon rupture from glucocorticoid injection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7977.html" rel="external">"Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Complications", section on 'Noninfectious complications'</a>.)</p><p>The ECU tendon can sublux or dislocate from its groove on the distal ulna. This condition is more common in athletes who play racquet sports, such as tennis and golf, or contact sports in which a ball is carried tightly, such as rugby and American football. The usual mechanisms of injury involve either loading of the wrist while it is held in a position of flexion, supination, and ulnar deviation, or the sudden application of a force to the wrist while the ECU tendon is performing an isometric contraction. In tennis, the former mechanism occurs during a double-handed backhand stroke, as the dominant hand moves forcefully from pronation to supination in order to put spin on the ball. In American football or rugby, the latter mechanism occurs when a ball carrier clutches the ball with the forearm in maximal supination and the wrist in flexion and ulnar deviation. A sudden increase in the force of the isometric contraction of the ECU as the player attempts to grip the ball more tightly may result in a traumatic tear of the sheath, leading to subluxation of the ECU tendon [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Tear of the sheath resulting in subluxation may also occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p>Patients with an ECU tendon subluxation or dislocation typically describe the sensation of clicking or popping as the wrist is actively moved into supination and extension, along with pain in the area of the ulnar styloid. Conservative management, including immobilization, rest, and NSAID therapy, is typically sufficient; in rare instances, surgery is needed. A primary care provider with limited experience managing such orthopedic problems may want to refer this injury to a hand surgeon. Early immobilization for ECU tendon instability involves the use of a long arm splint or cast with the forearm in pronation and the wrist in neutral position. If immobilization fails to alleviate the instability, surgery to reconstruct the ECU sheath is indicated [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769552"><span class="h3">Triangular fibrocartilage complex injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) stabilizes the wrist at the distal radioulnar joint and ulnocarpal articulations while allowing for adequate wrist motion, and is a focal point for force transmission across the ulnar aspect of the wrist [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex involves tears of the fibrocartilage articular disc and the tissue that connects the disc to the triquetrum and other carpals  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443" href="/d/graphic/63443.html" rel="external">figure 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80101" href="/d/graphic/80101.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). Trauma, such as a fall forward onto an outstretched hand, is the most common mechanism. The hand is usually in a pronated (palm down) position during the fall. Carpenters, plumbers, and individuals regularly performing similar manual tasks who often stress the wrist may develop chronic ulnar wrist pain from degeneration of the TFCC. </p><p>Wrist pain along the ulnar aspect of the wrist is the primary symptom of TFCC injury. Pain typically increases with any activity that requires forearm rotation and ulnar deviation of the wrist. A clinician may provoke the symptoms of a TFCC injury by holding the forearm and placing an axial load on the wrist (ie, compressing the joint with an axial load) while it is held in a position of ulnar deviation and extension  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86755" href="/d/graphic/86755.html" rel="external">picture 27</a>). Alternatively, the clinician can ask the patient to rise from a chair using their hands to push off from the armrests and see if this reproduces their symptoms. This movement compresses the ulnar aspect of the wrist with the joint in extension. </p><p>Plain radiographs of the wrist demonstrating an ulnar styloid fracture suggest a TFCC injury, but these studies appear normal if there is ligamentous instability without a fracture. Plain anteroposterior (AP) radiographs can be used to determine ulnar variance, which refers to the relative distance between the articular surfaces of the ulna and the radius  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73876" href="/d/graphic/73876.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). This distance affects the fraction of any load placed upon the wrist that is transmitted through the distal ulna. The load placed upon the ulna and the TFCC increases with positive ulnar variance and during wrist pronation, thereby increasing the risk for TFCC injury. In neutral ulnar variance (articular surfaces are at the same level), approximately 20 percent of a load is transmitted through the ulna. With negative ulnar variance (ulnar articular surface is proximal to that of the radius) the load across the ulna and the TFCC diminishes. This decrease in force transmission also occurs during supination because the radius moves distally on the ulna during this movement. </p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) arthrography can be helpful for diagnosing a TFCC tear  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87076" href="/d/graphic/87076.html" rel="external">image 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87077" href="/d/graphic/87077.html" rel="external">image 5</a>) [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Tears in the TFCC contain high signal fluid on fat-suppressed T1-weighted images. With a traumatic TFCC tear, fluid or contrast material is usually present in the distal radioulnar joint and other signs of associated local tissue injury may be seen. Limitations of MRI arthrography include its additional cost and the need to inject contrast medium into the joint. If the wrist is stable, treatment of a TFCC injury consists primarily of a temporary splint worn for four weeks. If pain persists after four weeks of splinting, referral to a hand surgeon is indicated. Surgical repair is needed if ligamentous tears have produced wrist instability. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769559"><span class="h2">Radial-sided wrist pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The structures involved in common causes of radial-sided wrist pain include those found in the accompanying graphic  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86702" href="/d/graphic/86702.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769567"><span class="h3">Scaphoid fracture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Scaphoid fractures are common following wrist trauma and the scaphoid is at relatively high risk for avascular necrosis following such a fracture.

Both the direction of the traumatic forces and the relative weakness of the volar ligaments contribute to dorsal displacement. Depending upon the amount of force involved and the position of the wrist during the fall, a range of possible injuries may occur. Of the potential ligamentous injuries, disruption of the ligaments stabilizing the lunate and scaphoid bones is most common [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. With more forceful trauma, dissociation of the lunate and capitate and/or triquetrum can occur.</p><p>The symptoms associated with scapholunate dissociation vary with the severity of the injury [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Patients may complain of swelling and pain over the dorsoradial aspect of the wrist (overlying the scaphoid and lunate), grip weakness, and painful or decreased wrist motion. Tenderness over the scapholunate junction is common. The scaphoid shift test can help detect ligamentous instability. Paradoxical motion of the scaphoid is another useful diagnostic test for instability. To perform this maneuver, the examiner places their thumb in the anatomic snuff box and has the patient repeatedly flex the thumb. If the scapholunate ligaments are intact, the body of the scaphoid will move dorsally against the thumb during flexion. If there is ligamentous dissociation, the body of the scaphoid moves away from the examiner’s thumb.

Patients with tendinopathy often complain of pain in the radial-volar region of the wrist where the tendon passes over the trapezium [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. Pain increases with resisted wrist flexion and radial deviation. Swelling may be present in the area of maximal tenderness. The condition is associated with activities involving frequent wrist flexion, such as basketball and racquet sports.</p><p>Tendinopathy of the flexor carpi ulnaris is uncommon.

Symptoms may result from an overlying ganglion or bursitis, an exterior tendon slipping over this bony prominence, or from osteoarthritic changes at the site. A carpal boss is often misdiagnosed as a ganglion cyst, but cysts are mobile and mucus-filled and therefore relatively soft compared to the fixed, firm, bony prominence of a carpal boss. </p><p>Diagnosis is often made with plain radiographs  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87266" href="/d/graphic/87266.html" rel="external">image 17</a>). A lateral view of the wrist with the forearm in 30 degrees of supination and the wrist in ulnar deviation is best for visualizing a carpal boss. The best treatment for carpal boss remains unclear but management can include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), wrist splinting, or surgical excision. The primary care provider may attempt treatment by splinting the wrist splint in neutral position and prescribing a short course of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication.

The mechanism remains unclear but appears to involve disruption of the blood supply, possibly related to undiagnosed fractures of the lunate, repetitive trauma, or abnormal biomechanical loading patterns at the radiocarpal joint [<a href="#rid31">31-34</a>]. The most common symptoms are dorsal wrist pain with mild swelling. Over time, the pain becomes persistent and is accompanied by crepitation, stiffness, and decreased range of motion.

With progression over months to years, there is increased density in the lunate (Stage 2), followed by bony collapse (Stage 3), and then carpal instability and arthritis (Stage 4). Kienböck disease is similar to other forms of avascular necrosis in that patients often present after the condition has been present for some time. Increased bone density on plain radiographs (seen in Stage 2) appears before signs of bony collapse (seen in Stage 3). Early referral to a hand surgeon is essential.

The mechanism of injury usually involves repetitive resisted wrist extension, such as with rowers and weight lifters, but can occur with any activity that involves a substantial increase in the use of the wrist extensors. Typically, patients present within a few weeks of the onset of symptoms, but delayed presentations may occur. The examiner may note redness, warmth, or crepitation at the site. The patient may describe a “squeaking” sound emanating from the tendon sheaths during repetitive wrist extension. Intersection syndrome is often confused with de Quervain tendinopathy. The distinguishing feature is the location of the pain: intersection syndrome is more dorsal  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86707" href="/d/graphic/86707.html" rel="external">picture 29</a>) while de Quervain’s is more radial  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86708" href="/d/graphic/86708.html" rel="external">picture 30</a>).

In addition, ultrasound allows for dynamic assessment (ie, performing a study while the patient or clinician manipulates the wrist) and examination of the contralateral asymptomatic wrist for comparison. Dynamic imaging may demonstrate pathology, such as tendon subluxation, that may not be detected with static imaging. Other advantages include cost effectiveness, absence of ionizing radiation, accessibility, and the ability to interact with the patient while performing the study. The disadvantages are that it is highly operator dependent and bony detail may not be as good when looking for carpal fractures. </p><p>Ultrasound accurately characterizes masses of the hand and wrist as cystic or solid and can be used to determine the diagnosis for the majority of these lesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96459" href="/d/graphic/96459.html" rel="external">image 16</a>).

The anatomy of the wrist is complex and the differential diagnosis broad. Fortunately, patients with wrist pain generally present with one of several common combinations of symptoms and signs that suggest the diagnosis. By following the basic approach outlined here, clinicians should be able to diagnose and either manage or refer appropriately the great majority of patients with subacute or chronic wrist complaints. The following flow chart provides an overview of our approach to wrist pain diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129676" href="/d/graphic/129676.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H543855"><span class="h2">Determine whether cause is traumatic or nontraumatic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step in determining the cause of subacute or chronic wrist pain is to determine whether the symptoms can be traced to an episode of direct trauma to the wrist. Most often this determination is straightforward based upon the patient's history. General questions to ask about wrist trauma include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Did your symptoms begin soon after an injury?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Describe how you injured your wrist? Where was the impact? What part of the forearm, wrist, or hand was injured?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What limits in wrist function and general activity have been caused by the injury?</p><p></p><p>Some patients with chronic wrist pain may not recall a specific injury, possibly because they never sought medical attention or the event was not memorable. In such circumstances, the clinician may need to ask questions specifically to prompt the patient’s memory. These questions might include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do you remember ever injuring your forearm, wrist, or hand before?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Do you remember “spraining” your wrist but not seeking medical attention at the time?</p><p></p><p>The most common wrist injuries sustained from minor trauma, usually a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH), include scaphoid fracture, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear, and ligamentous injury (eg, scapholunate). However, injuries may be missed initially leading to delayed presentations. Examples of commonly missed injuries include scaphoid or hook of the hamate fractures, ligamentous injuries (eg, scapholunate), and TFCC tears. In these cases, the patient is nearly always able to localize the pain and examination reveals focal tenderness and possibly deformity. Imaging studies make or confirm the diagnosis. </p><p>The first diagnostic imaging studies obtained in most cases are standard plain radiographs, which reveal most fractures and other bony pathology. Physicians experienced with ultrasound often use it to evaluate the wrist. Ultrasound is often helpful for assessing tendon pathology, arthritis, soft-tissue masses, swelling, nerve entrapment, effusion, and bone injury. Additional imaging studies may be needed depending upon the location of symptoms and the primary diagnoses being entertained. As examples, if a scaphoid fracture is suspected despite normal plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is obtained; if a hook of the hamate fracture is suspected despite normal plain radiographs, a computed tomography (CT) scan is preferred.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H969529"><span class="h2">Determine whether nontraumatic pain is from overuse or nerve compression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If no traumatic causes are identified by history, the clinician should next determine whether overuse accounts for the patient’s symptoms. The most common causes of subacute or chronic <strong>nontraumatic</strong> wrist pain are tendon degeneration related to overuse and nerve compression.</p><p>Conditions involving tendon degeneration include extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendinopathy, intersection syndrome, de Quervain tendinopathy, and less commonly tendinopathy involving the common extensor tendons (fourth compartment). Conditions related to nerve compression include carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar neuropathy (ie, Guyon’s canal syndrome). The history and physical examination, along with a basic knowledge of wrist anatomy, are generally sufficient to diagnose these conditions. Nerve compression syndromes generally involve pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the involved nerve, whereas pain from tendon damage increases when the tendon is stressed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83994.html" rel="external">"Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist"</a>.)</p><p>Chronic wrist pain unrelated to overuse or nerve compression may be caused by carpal boss, carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis, Kienböck disease, and ganglion cysts.

Key examination findings include some irregularity (“squaring”) at the CMC joint and pain referred to this area with resisted thumb flexion or extension. Plain radiograph or ultrasound confirms the diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Carpal metacarpal osteoarthritis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Volar (palmar) sided </strong>wrist pain</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</strong> – Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) causes paresthesias and pain in the median nerve distribution (typically involving the thenar eminence, thumb, index, and middle fingers). Symptoms are typically worse at night. Key physical findings include positive Phalen and Tinel’s tests  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68440" href="/d/graphic/68440.html" rel="external">picture 19</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58010" href="/d/graphic/58010.html" rel="external">picture 18</a>).

They may be misdiagnosed initially and often present with chronic pain localized over the hypothenar eminence; swelling may be minimal or absent. An important clinical test is for the examiner to place the PIP of their thumb on the patient’s pisiform and flex their thumb forcefully into the palm, which generally elicits pain if a fracture is present  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86753" href="/d/graphic/86753.html" rel="external">picture 13</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/203.html" rel="external">"Hamate fractures"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Ulnar nerve compression (Guyon’s Canal Syndrome)</strong> – This syndrome presents with hypothenar numbness after prolonged compression of the ulnar nerve during activities such as cycling or racquet sports  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57601" href="/d/graphic/57601.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). Often the physical examination is unremarkable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14172.html" rel="external">"Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and wrist", section on 'Ulnar neuropathy at the wrist'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy </strong>– These subacute causes of wrist pain occur less often than the others; musculoskeletal ultrasound is helpful for diagnosis [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Patients with flexor carpi radialis tendinopathy typically complain of pain in the region of the radial-volar region of the wrist. Pain increases with resisted wrist flexion and radial deviation [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. Swelling may be present in the area of maximal tenderness. Tendinopathy of the flexor carpi ulnaris causes tenderness at the ulnar-volar aspect of the wrist. Tenderness is typically present at the tendon a few centimeters proximal to its insertion on the pisiform [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Pain increases with resisted wrist flexion and ulnar deviation. (See <a class="local">'Flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy'</a> above.)  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dorsal sided wrist pain</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Ganglion cyst</strong> – A ganglion is a soft cystic swelling overlying a joint or tendon sheath that commonly develops at the dorsum of the wrist  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60204" href="/d/graphic/60204.html" rel="external">picture 28</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96459" href="/d/graphic/96459.html" rel="external">image 16</a>). Ganglions can cause pain and their size may increase or decrease depending upon activity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7761.html" rel="external">"Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand", section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Kienböck disease</strong> – Kienböck disease is a progressive collapse of the lunate that develops over years. The most common symptoms are dorsal wrist pain with mild swelling followed by persistent pain, crepitation, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. There may be associated weakness or difficulty grasping heavy objects. The diagnosis is made radiographically. Typically, there is tenderness at the proximal carpal row just distal to Lister’s tubercle. (See <a class="local">'Kienböck disease (avascular necrosis) of the lunate'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Carpal boss</strong> – The carpal boss is a bony prominence that presents like a ganglion on the dorsum of the wrist at the base of the second and third metacarpals, but it is firm rather than cystic and soft. Patients typically complain of pain and restricted motion. The diagnosis is made radiographically  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87266" href="/d/graphic/87266.html" rel="external">image 17</a>). Swelling that is firm and immobile helps differentiate this condition from a ganglion cyst. (See <a class="local">'Carpal boss'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Intersection syndrome</strong> – Intersection syndrome is caused by repetitive resisted wrist extension. It is often confused with de Quervain tendinopathy. The distinguishing feature is the location of the pain: symptoms from de Quervain’s develop along the radial aspect of the wrist  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86708" href="/d/graphic/86708.html" rel="external">picture 30</a>), while the most common area of discomfort from intersection syndrome is the dorsum of the wrist about 2 to 3 cm proximal to the radiocarpal joint in line with the index finger distally  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86707" href="/d/graphic/86707.html" rel="external">picture 29</a>).

(See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/117959.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: General issues in muscle and tendon injury diagnosis and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/139186.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Muscle and tendon injuries of the upper extremity (excluding shoulder)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5769710"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> – The wrist is susceptible to a range of injuries and overuse syndromes. Obtaining a clear history and correlating the history and symptom location with wrist anatomy are important elements of diagnosis. Important elements of the history include mechanism of injury, hand dominance, and occupation and recreational activities. The following flow chart provides an overview of our approach to wrist pain diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129676" href="/d/graphic/129676.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83994.html" rel="external">"Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist"</a> and <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – A systematic examination of the wrist includes inspection, palpation, range of motion, and relevant special tests. It is often helpful to compare affected and unaffected wrists. The history and initial examination findings determine which special tests should be performed. In all cases, a screening neurovascular assessment of the involved extremity should be performed. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomy-based diagnoses</strong> – A useful way to organize the differential diagnosis for subacute and chronic wrist pain is by location. Relatively common and important causes include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Ulnar sided wrist pain</strong>: Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinopathy or subluxation, or triangular fibrocartilage complex injury (see <a class="local">'Ulnar-sided wrist pain'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Radial sided wrist pain</strong>: Scaphoid fracture, scapholunate instability, de Quervain tendinopathy, carpal metacarpal osteoarthritis (see <a class="local">'Radial-sided wrist pain'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Volar sided wrist pain</strong>: Carpal tunnel syndrome, hook of the hamate fracture, ulnar neuropathy (see <a class="local">'Volar-sided wrist pain'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dorsal sided wrist pain</strong>: Ganglion cyst, carpal boss, Kienböck disease of the lunate, intersection syndrome (see <a class="local">'Dorsal-sided wrist pain'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong> – The history and physical examination help to localize the source of pain and narrow the differential diagnosis, but imaging is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. The first diagnostic imaging studies obtained in most cases are standard plain radiographs. Additional imaging studies may be needed depending upon the location of symptoms and the primary diagnoses being entertained. (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to diagnosis</strong> – A systematic approach to diagnosing the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain is provided in the text. Three important steps in making the diagnosis are: determining whether the cause of symptoms is most likely traumatic or nontraumatic; if nontraumatic, determining whether pain stems from an overuse syndrome or nerve compression; and, correlating the history and the location of symptoms and signs. The following flow chart provides an overview of our approach to wrist pain diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129676" href="/d/graphic/129676.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).
