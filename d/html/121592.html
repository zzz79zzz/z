Thus, some neonates will meet criteria for escalation of care but will not ultimately require exchange transfusion. (See <a class="local">'Criteria for exchange transfusion'</a> below.) </p><p>This was demonstrated in a study from the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative that included data on nearly 3,000,000 live-born term and late preterm newborns from 2007 to 2012, of whom 0.1 percent required admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for management of hyperbilirubinemia [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Among newborns admitted to the NICU, 19 percent developed severe hyperbilirubinemia (defined as TSB ≥25 mg/dL [428 micromol/L]), yet only 3 percent required exchange transfusion. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1312518312"><span class="h1">SETTING OF CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Newborns who meet the criteria for escalating care should be managed in an intensive care unit setting (depending on local resources, this may be a neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] or pediatric intensive care unit [PICU]). For patients being seen in the outpatient setting, it is preferable to directly admit to the NICU, if feasible, so that treatment can begin promptly. However, if this cannot be arranged, the patient should be referred to the emergency department at a facility where phototherapy is available. If the newborn cannot be promptly admitted to a NICU, the clinical team caring for the newborn should consult with a neonatologist to help guide management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H305216666"><span class="h1">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H386083474"><span class="h2">Tests to perform</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following laboratory tests should be obtained in all neonates requiring escalation of care for hyperbilirubinemia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Total serum or plasma bilirubin (TSB) and direct (or conjugated) serum bilirubin</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count and reticulocyte count</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Direct antiglobulin test (DAT), if not already performed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum albumin</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type and crossmatch</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity, if not already measured </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3979087713"><span class="h2">B/A ratio</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The bilirubin/albumin (B/A) ratio can be used as an additional factor in determining the need for exchange transfusion; it should not be used alone, but in conjunction with TSB values and other risk factors [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Calculation</strong> – The B/A mass ratio (in mg/g) is calculated as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Using conventional units – Divide the TSB (in mg/dL) by the serum albumin (in g/dL). For example, a newborn with a TSB of 21 mg/dL and a serum albumin of 3 g/dL would have a B/A mass ratio of 7. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Using Système International (SI) units – Divide the TSB (in micromol/L) by the serum albumin (in g/L) and then multiply by a factor of 0.585. For example, a newborn with a TSB of 359 micromol/L and a serum albumin of 30 g/L would have a B/A mass ratio of 7. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The B/A ratio can also be expressed as a molar ratio.

Elevated B/A ratios indicate that most binding sites on albumin are occupied. Further increases in bilirubin can lead to elevated levels of free (unbound) bilirubin, which can cross the blood-brain barrier resulting in neurotoxicity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121543" href="/z/d/graphic/121543.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The B/A ratio at which this occurs differs depending on gestational age (GA; and other risk factors for neurotoxicity)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139425" href="/z/d/graphic/139425.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). In addition, certain medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13136" href="/z/d/drug information/13136.html" rel="external">ceftriaxone</a>) can displace bilirubin from albumin.

These interventions should be started while preparations are made for possible exchange transfusion. In some cases, phototherapy and IV hydration may effectively reduce total serum or plasma bilirubin (TSB) levels such that exchange transfusion can be avoided. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3066738426"><span class="h2">Phototherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the newborn is not yet receiving phototherapy, phototherapy should be started immediately. If the newborn is already receiving phototherapy, efforts should be made to optimize its delivery (eg, maximizing skin exposure, using light sources from above and below the newborn, eliminating any interruptions to phototherapy). Additional details regarding phototherapy are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5063.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm newborns: Initial management", section on 'Initial intervention (phototherapy)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4068743322"><span class="h2">IV hydration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For newborns who meet criteria for escalation of care, we suggest IV hydration. IV hydration is provided with crystalloid fluid (typically 10 percent dextrose with one-quarter normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/z/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a>) at a maintenance rate (ie, approximately 80 mL/kg per day for newborns &lt;48 hours old; 80 to 100 mL/kg per day for those ≥48 hours old). Subsequent adjustments are based on measurement of serum electrolytes. We suggest <strong>not</strong> using colloid infusions such 5 or 25 percent albumin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5065.html" rel="external">"Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns"</a>.)</p><p>Limited clinical trial evidence suggests that IV hydration in addition to phototherapy lowers TSB levels faster and may reduce the need for exchange transfusion [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. In a meta-analysis of seven trials involving 462 newborns with hyperbilirubinemia who were randomly assigned to supplemental IV hydration or no IV hydration, TSB levels at 12 hours were modestly lower in the IV hydration group (mean difference 0.6 mg/dL [10 micromol/L]) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Exchange transfusion rates were also lower in the IV hydration group (6 versus 15 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.71). No newborns in either group developed acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE). The trials included in the meta-analysis had important methodologic limitations, including small numbers, lack of blinding, selective reporting, and limited follow-up. In addition, many of these trials were performed prior to the introduction of blue light-emitting diode-based phototherapy, which is not associated with increased fluid losses. The use of fluorescent- or halogen-based phototherapy devices, which can cause overheating and fluid loss, in these trials may have confounded their results. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5063.html" rel="external">"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm newborns: Initial management", section on 'Light sources and devices'</a>.) </p><p>Based on the available trial data, the certainty that IV hydration hastens resolution of hyperbilirubinemia relative to phototherapy alone is low.

It has been suggested that infusion of albumin one to two hours before the procedure might theoretically allow for removal of more bilirubin by shifting more extravascular bilirubin into the circulation.
