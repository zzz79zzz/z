This usage is not accurate. Most febrile illnesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop distinguishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. FUO refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing.</p><p>The most common causes of FUO in adults will be reviewed here. The evaluation and management of the adult with FUO, and the etiology of FUO in children, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2736.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in adults: Evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5996.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology"</a>.)</p><p>There are myriad causes of classic FUO, and determining an etiology is often difficult because fever is a nonspecific and common finding in many diseases. It has been estimated that over 200 causes of classic FUO have been documented in the literature [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic discusses etiologies of <strong>classic</strong> fever or unknown origin. Other categories of FUO, not discussed in this topic, include health care-associated FUO, FUO in immunocompromised patients, and travel-associated FUO. These categories are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2736.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in adults: Evaluation and management", section on 'Health care-associated FUO'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2736.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in adults: Evaluation and management", section on 'FUO in immunocompromised patients'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2736.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in adults: Evaluation and management", section on 'Travel-associated FUO'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1836033155"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF CLASSIC FUO</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fevers of unknown origin are typically divided into one of four categories. This topic discusses "classic FUO," which is typically defined as a temperature &gt;38.3˚C (100.9˚F) recorded on several occasions for &gt;3 weeks despite appropriate initial inpatient or outpatient evaluation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Some experts have more recently proposed that the temperature threshold be decreased from &gt;38.3˚C to &gt;38.0˚C (100.4˚F) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>Definitions of categories of FUO other than classic FUO are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2736.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in adults: Evaluation and management", section on 'Definitions and categories of fuo'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1597984647"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observational data have led experts to classify causes of classic FUO into five different categories [<a href="#rid1">1,2,4-16</a>]. Meta-analyses have estimated the relative proportion of FUOs caused by diseases in each of these categories [<a href="#rid2">2,4-6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infections (34 to 39 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rheumatologic conditions (20 to 23 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neoplasms (12 to 16 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Miscellaneous causes (6 to 7 percent)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Undiagnosed (20 to 25 percent)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2643068126"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The epidemiology of classic FUO is influenced by factors such as geographic location and patient age [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2838109615"><span class="h2">Changes over time</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As medical care and socioeconomic conditions have changed, some studies have reported that the proportion of FUOs due to infection has steadily decreased  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73878" href="/d/graphic/73878.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,17,18</a>].</p><p>However, comparing studies from different decades may lead to inaccurate conclusions due to advancements in medications (antimicrobials and nonantimicrobials), emergence of new diseases, and changes in diagnostic techniques and the practice of medicine over time [<a href="#rid2">2,17,18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1179622847"><span class="h2">Geographic variation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The causes of classic FUO vary by geographic location, particularly the proportion of FUOs caused by infection [<a href="#rid2">2,4,5</a>].</p><p>Factors that contribute to variation include geographic differences among endemic infections, such as tuberculosis and brucellosis, genetic predispositions to certain diseases, and the financial and medical resources in each locale [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3870541621"><span class="h2">Influence of patient-age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data suggest that the breakdown of causes of FUO varies based on patients' ages. </p><p>Studies have reported that older adults (ie, &gt;65 years old) are more likely than younger adults (&lt;65 years old) to ultimately have an etiology identified, whereas no specific cause of fever is found in a higher proportion of younger adults [<a href="#rid12">12,19,20</a>]. Frequent diagnoses in older adults include giant-cell arteritis, urinary tract infection, and malignancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4227767281"><span class="h2">Effects of climate change</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As the earth warms due to climate change, some experts anticipate changes in the distribution of infectious diseases, including those known to cause FUO [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Pathogens, vectors, and animal hosts propagate in certain climates, dependent upon temperature and humidity. </p><p>Extreme weather events may impact the environmental burden of pathogens; for example, areas affected by flood are at increased risk of waterborne pathogens and pathogens that thrive in unsanitary conditions (eg, enteric fever, leptospirosis), whereas areas affected by increased drought may more easily disperse endemic fungal pathogens (eg, <em>Coccidioidomycosis</em>) into the air.</p><p>Furthermore, climate-related human migration may drive susceptible people into areas with endemic disease and push those with infection into areas where disease is not present. </p><p>It is not uncommon for the epidemiology of infectious diseases to change over time. For example, there are proven instances of infectious organisms entering new locales via cross-country travel of humans, animals, or vectors (eg, COVID-19, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales) [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].<em> </em>For scientists, proving that climate change is the primary cause of changing epidemiology of infectious diseases remains a challenge. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31770231"><span class="h1">INFECTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infections are the most common worldwide cause of FUO, responsible for 34 to 39 percent of cases based on available data [<a href="#rid2">2,4-6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Overview of causes'</a> above.)</p><p>The likelihood of an infectious etiology varies by geography. For instance, in Southeast Asia, approximately half of all FUOs are due to infections, whereas approximately 30 percent of FUOs in Europe are from infection [<a href="#rid2">2,4,5</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, infectious causes vary geographically. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2416970283"><span class="h2">Generalized infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Generalized infections present diagnostic challenges because they have nonspecific presenting features. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H767895426"><span class="h3">Tuberculosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most case series, tuberculosis (TB) is among the top three causes of classic FUO [<a href="#rid2">2,4-6</a>]. Data suggest that TB is the top cause of FUO in Europe (responsible for 16 percent of cases), Southeast Asia (32 percent of cases), and the Western Pacific (18 percent of cases). </p><p>Extrapulmonary TB is more likely to cause FUO than pulmonary TB, which is usually evident on chest radiography. Extrapulmonary TB can manifest in different regions of the body, including lymph nodes, liver, bone marrow, pleura, pericardium, bone, joints, central nervous system, adrenal glands, genitourinary tract, and other systems. Typically, tissue biopsy or sampling of bodily fluid is necessary to make the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8001.html" rel="external">"Tuberculous lymphadenitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7658.html" rel="external">"Bone and joint tuberculosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1238.html" rel="external">"Abdominal tuberculosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8003.html" rel="external">"Urogenital tuberculosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8009.html" rel="external">"Central nervous system tuberculosis: An overview"</a>.)</p><p>Miliary TB, another form of TB, is due to ongoing hematogenous spread of TB organisms and is characterized by numerous small bilateral lung nodules with, in some cases, simultaneous involvement of organs outside the lungs. Like extrapulmonary TB, diagnosis of miliary TB requires confirmation of the organism in tissue biopsy or bodily secretions. Acid-fast staining and positive cultures are less likely to be positive in patients with miliary TB, and multiple samples are often necessary to confirm the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8024.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of miliary tuberculosis"</a>.)</p><p>Of note, the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10029" href="/d/drug information/10029.html" rel="external">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) lack sensitivity and specificity in patients with any form of active TB, especially miliary TB [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. While a positive test increases the likelihood of active TB, it does not confirm the diagnosis; likewise, a negative test does not rule out active TB. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111683.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults", section on 'All patients'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8024.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of miliary tuberculosis", section on 'Clinical approach'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3872480296"><span class="h3">Mononucleosis-like syndromes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Often, classic FUO is due to unusual presentations of common illnesses, such as common viral infections. Many patients with common viral infections will report close contact with sick individuals.</p><p>The most common causes are organisms that cause mononucleosis-like syndromes (ie, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)</strong> – EBV is the classic cause of mononucleosis and typically infects teenagers and young adults, although it can infect older patients as well. In addition to fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat, it also commonly causes headache, persistent severe fatigue, and splenomegaly. Lymphadenopathy of the posterior cervical nodes is most common, although any nodes can be enlarged. Some patients present without pharyngitis and are described as having the "typhoidal form" of illness. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Characteristic lab results primarily include lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. Rapid diagnosis can be achieved by testing for heterophile antibodies (ie, the "Monospot" test), but this test can be negative in 10 to 30 percent of patients, particularly in those with the typhoidal form of illness. EBV infection in patients with negative heterophile antibody tests can be confirmed by testing for EBV-specific antibodies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8318.html" rel="external">"Infectious mononucleosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute HIV syndrome</strong> – Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can cause symptoms similar to those of EBV-associated mononucleosis. It is discussed further below. (See <a class="local">'Acute HIV syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute cytomegalovirus infection</strong> – Patients with acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) often present with fever, headache, and malaise without pharyngitis or enlarged cervical lymph nodes. They are less likely to have splenomegaly, may not have atypical lymphocytes, and may be more likely to have elevated aminotransferases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8289.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent adults", section on 'CMV mononucleosis'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Diagnosis of acute CMV is hampered by suboptimal tests. Serologic tests lack specificity for acute illness, whereas antigen and molecular tests may detect viral shedding that is not necessarily indicative of symptomatic infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8291.html" rel="external">"Overview of diagnostic tests for cytomegalovirus infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute toxoplasmosis</strong> – <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>is a less common cause of mononucleosis-like illness than EBV, CMV, and HIV. It is a parasitic infection that causes symptoms and signs similar to other causes of mononucleosis; lymphadenopathy can persist for weeks. Mild atypical lymphocytosis may be present. Main risk factors are ingestion of undercooked meat in resource-abundant countries, exposure to contaminated water sources in resource-limited countries, and exposure to cat feces.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis is made by serologic testing with immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody tests and/or acute and convalescent IgG antibody tests. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120887.html" rel="external">"Toxoplasmosis: Acute systemic disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3028897174"><span class="h3">Acute HIV syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the early stages of HIV infection, patients may present with an unexplained febrile illness consistent with mononucleosis. Early recognition of HIV infection is important because it prevents further transmission and allows early treatment, which affords long-term benefit to the patient. Features suggestive of acute HIV include fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, myalgia, and headache. The presence of painful oral ulcers, rash, and relevant sexual exposures should increase suspicion of acute HIV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87682" href="/d/graphic/87682.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86984.html" rel="external">"Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Patients may or may not report risk factors, such as recent sexual activity or injection drug use, but the diagnosis should be considered in all patients with mononucleosis-like illness because not all patients reveal their risk factors. In patients with compatible symptoms, diagnosis can be confirmed by a positive HIV viral load or antigen test coupled with a negative HIV antibody test. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86984.html" rel="external">"Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2501760926"><span class="h3">Brucellosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data suggest that brucellosis is the most common cause of FUO in the Eastern Mediterranean region and is the second most common cause in the Western Pacific region [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Brucellosis is endemic in the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, Central Asia, China, the Indian subcontinent, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Mexico and Central and South America  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121902" href="/d/graphic/121902.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3140.html" rel="external">"Brucellosis: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The primary risk factor for brucellosis is consumption of unpasteurized animal products, especially unpasteurized dairy products (eg, raw mild, soft cheese, butter). Clinical manifestations may include persistent fever and malaise, arthralgia/arthritis, back pain, epididymitis or orchitis, hepatosplenomegaly, elevation of liver enzymes, and hematologic abnormalities. A presumptive diagnosis can be made via serologic tests, but cultures of tissue or bodily fluids is often necessary. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31702102"><span class="h3">Infective endocarditis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Endocarditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in most patients with FUO, especially since it can be usually diagnosed with blood cultures and because it is associated with a high mortality if undiagnosed. Specific risk factors increase the likelihood, including prior endocarditis, known valvular or congenital heart disease, the presence of a prosthetic heart valve, and injection drug use. FUO with a new or changed murmur suggests the infection, but other presentations, such as stroke or bilateral lung nodules, can occur from embolic events. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2143.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected left-sided native valve endocarditis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2149.html" rel="external">"Right-sided native valve infective endocarditis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2138.html" rel="external">"Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Most, but not all patients, will have positive blood cultures and the diagnosis can usually be confirmed by echocardiograph. The most common cause of blood-culture negative endocarditis is prior antimicrobial therapy, although organisms associated with culture-negative endocarditis include <em>Coxiella burnetiid</em> (Q fever), <em>Tropheryma whipplei</em> (Whipple's disease), <em>Brucella</em>, <em>Mycoplasma</em>, <em>Chlamydia</em>, <em>Histoplasma</em>, <em>Legionella</em>, and <em>Bartonella</em> [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Additionally, <em>Haemophilus</em> spp, <em>Actinobacillus</em>, <em>Cardiobacterium</em>, <em>Eikenella</em>, and <em>Kingella</em> (the so-called HACEK group) historically caused culture-negative endocarditis, although microbiologic isolation of these organisms has substantially improved.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H460383316"><span class="h3">Enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Enteric fever is most prevalent in impoverished, overcrowded areas with poor access to sanitation. The highest incidence occurs in south-central Asia, Southeast Asia, and southern Africa. The disease is spread by contaminated food or water or sharing space with an infected individual. </p><p>Patients with enteric fevers typically present with fever and chills and may have relative bradycardia (lack of expected increase in heart rate during fever), but this finding is neither highly specific nor sensitive. During the second week of illness, the illness typically progresses to include abdominal pain. As the disease further progresses, hepatosplenomegaly and a rash ("rose spots") may develop; in some patients, intestinal perforation can occur.</p><p>Leukopenia may be a distinguishing feature, and increased transaminases are common and a useful diagnostic clue.
