         Growth impairment during early infancy, a period of substantial cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy, can have permanent detrimental effects. Abnormalities in growth during this time period may persist into adulthood, especially in patients who were preterm infants.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preterm infants are at risk for poor growth while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and after discharge from the NICU. They must be closely monitored and may require interventions to promote better growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Growth in the preterm infant, including monitoring of growth and managing growth impairment while in the NICU and after discharge, will be discussed here. Enteral and parenteral nutrition for preterm infants are discussed separately. (See

         Weight increases by 208 g/week from 28 weeks gestation to 6 months of age. After birth, infants typically gain 30 g/day until 3 months of age and 20 g/day between 3 and 12 months of age.

         Curves used to track growth of preterm infants are not ideal. Growth curves for very low birth weight infants that reflect neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) practices common during the 1990s have been reported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, these curves do not necessarily describe optimal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once they regain their birth weight (BW), the growth of preterm infants is targeted to the following goals based upon the estimated intrauterine growth from historical cohort studies of live births of infants of varying gestational age (GA) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         However, this practice has resulted in inadequate growth, as most low BW infants have weights that are below the 10
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile at the time of discharge [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,6
         </a>
         ]. In addition, growth through gestation and early infancy is not constant and the above rates appear to be accurate for limited time periods [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. There are also often periods of slower growth that occur during episodes of infection or feeding intolerance that need to be compensated by accelerated growth during other time periods [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, calculations of growth can be greatly affected by the exact method of calculation, something that is often overlooked when comparing different published studies [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. As a result, although available evidence supports a minimum weight gain of 15 g/kg per day, which we use along with most centers, this minimal goal may not always be appropriate and targeting a higher goal of up to 20 g/kg per day may be more suitable for infants who are between 23 and 36 weeks postmenstrual age [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An alternative approach has been proposed that assessment of growth should be based on the growth of preterm infants with normal fetal development and little short-term morbidity [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, available data using this approach are very limited and do not reflect long-term outcomes. Further studies are needed to establish appropriate growth targets in preterm infants to determine the optimal approach.

         In the last decade, the number of high quality neonatal growth charts has increased greatly. These include the Olsen, Bertino, and Fenton growth charts, which use advanced mathematical modeling approaches such as the lambda-mu-sigma method (LMS) that allow the calculation of precise Z-scores and centiles [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. As the number of charts has increased, so have questions about which ones should be used and when. Based on the available data, we continue to prefer the use of the Olsen and Bertino charts in our center. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5356.html" rel="external">
          "Measurement of growth in children", section on 'Use of Z-scores'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The selection of growth chart used depends on local practice and preference. Based on the available charts, we suggest the following based on the age of the preterm infant:

         Up to 36 weeks gestation – The Olsen  (

          figure 2
         </a>
         ) and Bertino charts are the best growth charts to assess appropriate for gestational age (AGA), small for gestational age (SGA), or large for gestational age (LGA) status at all GAs [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. They perform relatively poorly for growth monitoring for preterm infants beyond 36 weeks of age.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Between 36 to 50 weeks corrected age (10 weeks post-term), the Fenton chart is the best growth chart to assess longitudinal growth in preterm infants over this period [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         After four to eight weeks post-term, the World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts for normal children can be used. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5356.html" rel="external">
          "Measurement of growth in children", section on 'Infants 0 to 2 years'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         However, despite these charts, growth monitoring remains challenging between 36 and 44 weeks corrected GA. For infants greater than 44 weeks corrected GA, the preterm infant is being compared with the term infant who has already undergone normal postnatal weight loss. For the infants below 36 weeks corrected age, the growing preterm infant (who has already undergone normal postnatal weight loss) is often compared with the newborn preterm who has not undergone normal postnatal weight loss. The Fenton chart smooths these two groups together, and as a result, upwards crossing of centile during these transition periods may not reflect true catch-up growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Olsen  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90443" href="/z/d/graphic/90443.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90444" href="/z/d/graphic/90444.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) and Bertino charts are based on large cohorts of newborn infants, and after excluding pregnancies with conditions likely to affect fetal growth, have constructed references for the BW of newborn infants across a wide GA range [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. As a result, they are optimally suited to determine whether babies are born LGA, SGA, or AGA.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, the Olsen and Bertino charts are not representative of the growth of preterm infants. These charts based on the BW have a sigmoid shape, with the gain in weight with gestation flattening out at older GAs. This may be due in part to developing placental insufficiency at the end of gestation, but part is an artifact as GA becomes more upwardly censored at higher GA. So, for example, for infants presumed to be 34 weeks GA, a similar number are probably greater than 34 weeks and less than 34 weeks gestation. However, at a higher GA of 40 weeks, more infants are probably truly less than 40 weeks than truly greater than 40 weeks gestation (as fewer infants are born at &gt;40 weeks gestation than &lt;40 weeks gestation). This causes the curve of BW against GA to flatten at both the higher and lower extremes of gestation. This flattening near term is not reflected in the growth of preterm infants, because their growth does not slow at this time point. As a result, these curves are less well suited to the longitudinal growth monitoring of preterm infants as they approach their expected term date at 36 weeks gestation.
        </p>
        <p>
         To overcome this limitation, in the Fenton charts the BW cohorts were "smoothed" into reference charts of term-born infants  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70389" href="/z/d/graphic/70389.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90267" href="/z/d/graphic/90267.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). Although this method has been criticized, the Fenton charts have been validated as a growth monitoring tool in preterm infants [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. However, this smoothing approach means that they perform poorly in classifying newborn near-term and term infants as being AGA, SGA, or LGA. As a result, after four to eight weeks post-term, the WHO growth charts should be used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two additional reference charts have been published. However, both are limited by the narrow range of GAs that are covered, which limits their usefulness in tracking growth.

         Consortium published reference charts for preterm infants with GA between 24 and 33 weeks, based on data collected from centers from eight different global locations (Brazil, Italy, China, India, the United Kingdom, Kenya, Oman, and the United States) and with diverse ethnic backgrounds [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. The number of infants was substantially fewer for this international reference than the other two that were based in the United States (Olsen) and Italy (Bertino). In addition, there remain concerns that fetal growth parameters may differ based on ethnicity and that population-based growth references for infants with the same genetic and environmental backgrounds should be used [

         Weight and head circumference charts for preterm infants with GA between 22 and 29 weeks were developed using data from the Vermont Oxford Network [

         There is limited evidence that poor growth determined using fetal growth references (eg, Fenton or Olsen curves) was more strongly associated with subsequent development outcome than the use of reference charts from the INTERGROWTH-21

         Postnatal growth for the preterm infant is primarily monitored as weight gain, because it is more reliable and reproducible than measurements of length and head circumferences. Changes in length and head circumference also are inadequate measures during short time frames, whereas weight gain can be accurately measured on a day-to-day basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, weight gain is expressed in a number of ways (g/kg/d, g/d, or change in Z-scores), making it challenging to compare growth rates from different studies and also resulting in clinical practice variation [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The easiest and probably best clinical measure of weight is expressed in g/kg/d using this equation, which is used in our center:
        </p>
        <div class="formulaContainer">
         <div class="formula">
          <p class="bulletIndent1">

        </div>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Variability is less the longer the time between the two time points, as the difference in weight usually increases, while the error in weight measurements remains the same. The optimal interval over which to measure weight gain is probably five to seven days [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         Both increased nutritional requirements due to stress (eg, episodes of sepsis) and inadequate nutritional intake contribute to the poor growth of hospitalized preterm infants [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21-23

         ]. Inadequate intake can occur with either enteral or parenteral nutrition [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Immature gastrointestinal function limits the advancement of enteral feedings, while poor tolerance of intravenous lipids and glucose limits the use of parenteral nutrition. As a result, in preterm infants, nutrient intakes often fail to meet the recommended dietary intakes, resulting in rapid accruement of protein and energy deficits [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The risk and extent of poor weight growth increase with decreasing gestational age (GA) and are most severe in extremely low birth weight infants (BW &lt;1000 g).
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational studies of large cohorts of preterm infants have reported improvement of growth, but there remains a substantial proportion of very low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g) at hospital discharge [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24-26
         </a>
         ]. These results demonstrate the need for greater protein and energy intake on a body-weight basis in the preterm infant compared with term infants. Continued efforts to improve intake are required to ensure adequate growth for the preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A more detailed discussion on enteral nutrition and feeding for the preterm infant to maintain adequate growth is found elsewhere. (See

         The nutritional goal for most preterm infants during hospitalization is for an energy intake of 120 kcal/kg per day  (

         In some NICUs, a cue-based approach to in-hospital feeding based on recognizing the satiety cues from the infant has been adopted for more preterm infants who can feed orally. Limited data suggest that this infant-driven feeding practice shortens the length of time for infants to attain full feedings and reduces length of stay [

          28,29

However, it is not clear whether this method of feeding will improve overall growth, or reduce the number of infants diagnosed with poor oral feeding or the need for orogastric or nasogastric feeds after discharge. Nevertheless, further investigation of this feeding method is warranted to see if there is any additional benefit of cue-based feeding over the traditional feeding based on a fixed time schedule.

         Prior to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge, infants should have a nutritional evaluation, and a feeding plan should be developed. This should account for factors that interfered with growth in the NICU and provide a baseline for serial monitoring of weight, length, and head circumference after discharge. Additionally, an assessment should be made of the home environment, including eligibility for government nutrition or medical assistance programs, as lack of social support may be associated with growth failure (eg, poor weight gain).
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to discharge, the infant should usually be able to consume ad libitum quantities of human milk or formula. Less commonly, fluid intake may be limited at prescribed levels, or tube feeding (or other artificial means of feeding) is used. Whatever the feeding plan is, appropriate growth should be demonstrated on the proposed discharge feeding regimen while the infant is hospitalized. The target volume generally is one that supports a weight gain of at least 15 g/kg per day or higher. (See

         There are few data regarding the specific nutrient intakes required in preterm infants after discharge. The overall goal is to achieve the body composition and rate of growth of a normal fetus/infant of the same postmenstrual age during the first entire year of life [

         Growth parameters include the infant's weight, length, and head circumference and should be monitored on a weekly to biweekly basis for the first four to six weeks after hospital discharge. After this initial period of close observation, infants who are growing normally can be monitored every month and then every two months.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corrections for gestational age (GA) should be made for weight through 24 months of age, for stature through 40 months of age, and for head circumference through 18 months of age. We recommend using the Fenton preterm infant growth chart until the infant is 44 to 48 weeks postmenstrual age  (

         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32
         </a>
         ]. There is a 10-week transition period when both charts can be used simultaneously and Z-score values can be compared. (See

          'Growth chart'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Biweekly or monthly follow-up visits should continue for infants with slow weight gain who remain below the third percentile on a standard growth curve when they have reached 40 postmenstrual weeks, or who have chronic health problems (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). Close monitoring should continue until a steady adequate growth pattern is established [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Infants who fall off their growth curve are growing suboptimally (ie, failing to thrive due to inadequate weight gain) and should be evaluated and treated as soon as the poor growth is identified. Delays in instituting treatment simply worsen the degree of growth failure and increase the amount of catch-up growth that will subsequently be required to achieve normal growth. (See

         Infants who are extremely short may need further evaluation for growth retardation, including consultation by a pediatric endocrinologist. Referral is based on the extent of the shortness, parental concern, and whether catch-up growth has occurred. (See

         Slow head growth is associated with developmental delay.

         For infants who receive formula, it remains uncertain whether the use of nutrient-enriched formula is beneficial after hospital discharge [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,35-37
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, the decision whether or not to use a nutritional enriched formula should be made as part of the discharge planning process of formula-fed preterm infants. In our institution, we recommend enriched formula for infants with weights below the 10th percentile for age and who were born with BWs below 1500 g. We also recommend changing to enriched formula in those infants who initially received standard formula if they fail to maintain adequate growth or fail to "catch up" after hospital discharge. In our practice, we typically use enriched formula for preterm infants until they are six months of age post-term or until they have achieved adequate catch-up growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The commercially available enriched formulas compared with standard formulas are calorically denser (75 kcal/100 mL versus 67 kcal/100 mL) and have a higher content of protein, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and vitamins A, E, and D. In infants who receive standard formulas, additional vitamin D supplementation and iron may be required through the first year of life to meet the needs of preterm neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) graduates [
         <a href="#rid30">

        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review of studies evaluated growth and neurodevelopmental outcome in infants who received nutrient-rich formula versus those who received standard full-term formula [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. The quality of evidence was graded as moderate because of major potential bias due to the lack of allocation concealment and incomplete follow-up. The study found inconsistent results on the benefit of "postdischarge" formula (caloric density 74 kcal/100 mL) compared with standard formula on growth at 12 and 18 months of age postterm. However, there was evidence that the use of "preterm" formula (caloric density 80 kcal/100 mL), which is generally only available for in-hospital use, resulted in higher rates of weight gain at 12 to 18 months postterm.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is the author's view that the balance of the evidence favors a small, but significant, growth advantage to enriched formulas after discharge. However, whether these benefits are sustained and whether they improve or worsen long-term health is unclear. An alternate approach is to provide enriched formulas to preterm infants who do not maintain adequate growth or fail to "catch up" after hospital discharge, although this approach has not been systematically studied.

         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, maintaining human milk feeding of the preterm infant after hospital discharge should remain the goal due to the many non-nutritional advantages of human milk feeding. The choice of whether, how, and how long to supplement human milk-fed infants needs to be individualized based on the infant's own risk factors, prior and ongoing growth, and ability of the parents to carry out the suggested regimens. Some regimens (eg, fortification of expressed human milk) require significant effort with collection of pumped breast milk and addition of nutrients, and may be beyond some families to implement successfully. Use of unfortified human milk, with appropriate growth monitoring, remains a valid alternative for many preterm infants although growth may be poorer. However, if growth is inadequate, two or three feeds daily of a postdischarge enriched formula may be provided [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,40
         </a>
         ]. Post-discharge formula also may be used if the human milk supply is inadequate. There is no evidence to suggest how long fortified human milk feeds should be given, but the author's personal practice is to continue this practice until six months after the estimated date of term delivery or confinement (EDC). Growth monitoring should ensure that growth in weight and length are proportional. If excessive weight is gained compared with length, or if there is upwards crossing of weight-for-length centiles, consideration should be given to reducing nutritional fortification if infants are received enriched formulas or fortified human milk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Human milk-fed preterm infants should receive iron after two weeks of age and vitamin D supplementation when the infant reaches 1500 g, as these two nutrients are inadequately supplied by human milk alone [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Exclusively human milk-fed infants appear to be at risk for osteopenia of prematurity, and biochemical evaluation will often detect an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase after discharge. Infants who receive non-fortified human milk have calcium and phosphorus deficiency and reduced bone mineral content [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         Some preterm infants will struggle to maintain adequate enteral caloric intake due to poor oral feeding from developmental problems, oral aversion, or chronic medical problems. In particular, infants who were intubated and mechanically ventilated for a long time period may have difficulty with oral feeding, in part because of abnormal development of suck and swallow rhythms [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43

         In rare cases, infants with oral motor dysfunction may benefit from nasogastric or orogastric tube feeding while awaiting developmental improvement in the coordination required for oral feeding.

         Although it is established that poor growth is a common problem in infants with BPD, there has only been one randomized controlled trial to study the efficacy of nutrient-enriched formula in affected patients. In this study of 60 infants with BPD, patients were randomly assigned to one of two different 30 kcal/oz formulas until three months corrected age. Infants receiving protein and mineral-enriched formula had better growth than control infants at three months corrected age. However, there was no difference in growth between the two groups at 12 months corrected age [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Whether this means that the benefits to the formula were transient, or whether the difference is dependent upon continued administration of nutrient-enriched formula beyond three months corrected age is not clear.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our institution, the nutritional management of these infants is highly individualized, especially in those with severe BPD. Fluid intake is largely determined by the baby's respiratory status. Enriched formulas or fortified human milk can be modified to meet the age-appropriate nutritional intakes of these infants with higher nutrient needs than preterm infants without chronic disease [

         Greater weight gain before reaching term appears to be associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcome. This was illustrated in a study of 613 infants (GA below 33 weeks) that demonstrated greater weight gain, BMI, and head growth before 40 weeks postmenstrual age (ie, term) were associated with higher Bayley Mental and Psychomotor Developmental Indexes (MDI/PDI) scores at 18 months corrected age [

After four months corrected age, there was no association between any growth parameter and cognitive testing.

         Preterm infants are often significantly underweight at the time of hospital discharge. At discharge, they remain at increased nutritional risk and merit close growth monitoring after hospital discharge. (See

         Enriched formula may improve the growth of preterm infants and is a reasonable option for formula-fed babies. For infants who were born with birth weights below 1500 g (very low birth weight infants), we suggest using enriched formula versus standard formula for infants with weights below the 10
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile for age at the time of hospital discharge or until full feeds are established (

          Grade 2B

         After hospital discharge, exclusively human milk-fed preterm infants are at increased risk for suboptimal growth compared with formula-fed infants. If there is suboptimal growth, we suggest that infants receive two or three supplemental feedings of enriched formula daily (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The long-term goal is to maintain human milk feeding in these infants. (See

          'Human milk-fed infants'

         Human milk-fed preterm infants should also receive iron and vitamin D supplementation, as these two nutrients are inadequately supplied by human milk alone. (See
         <a class="local">

         </span>
         For formula-fed preterm infants, we suggest that they receive an enriched formula until six months of age postterm or until they have achieved adequate catch-up growth (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C

         Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are at increased risk of growth failure after hospital discharge. Protein and mineral-enriched feeds may provide short-term advantages in growth. In our practice, the feeding of these infants needs to be individualized before hospital discharge to ensure adequate growth within the fluid intake limits imposed by the chronic lung disease. (See

          'Bronchopulmonary dysplasia'
