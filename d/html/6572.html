Initial trauma management in the unstable child is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY AND INJURY CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For this review, the stable pediatric trauma patient refers to an injured child who initially has normal or near normal vital signs, normal vital functions (airway, breathing, circulation, mental status), and no readily apparent critical injury. It is imperative for the trauma provider to use normative values for children as opposed to adults when assessing vital signs. Normal vital signs change with age in children. In general, heart and respiratory rates are higher than in adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097" href="/z/d/graphic/78097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and blood pressure is lower. The 5<sup>th</sup> percentile systolic blood pressure for age can be approximated by the following formula for children 1 to 10 years of age:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>Systolic pressure (5<sup>th</sup> percentile) = 70 mmHg + 2 X (age in years)</p></div></div><p>Many seriously injured children, who ultimately require hospitalization and/or surgical intervention, initially appear stable. It is incumbent on the emergency provider to thoroughly evaluate initially stable appearing traumatized children and to identify those at high risk for serious injury based on mechanism and physical findings  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424" href="/z/d/graphic/60424.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293" href="/z/d/graphic/57293.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H425775666"><span class="h2">Injury classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traumatic injuries can range from minor to life-threatening. Several methods for measuring severity of injury exist. In order to appropriately triage the management of the trauma patient, one useful method to categorize injuries uses the following parameters (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6459.html" rel="external">"Classification of trauma in children"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Injury extent</strong> – Multiple trauma is defined by apparent injury to two or more body areas. Localized trauma involves only one anatomic region (eg, head and neck, chest and back, abdomen, extremities) of the body. Sometimes the extent of injury may be obvious; at other times this may not be readily apparent, and the clinical picture may evolve over time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Injury type</strong> – The expected injuries differ based on whether they occur as a result of blunt trauma (eg, fall, motor vehicle collision [MVC]) or penetrating trauma (eg, gunshot, stabbing, or shrapnel from explosion).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Injury severity</strong> – The mechanism of injury and physical examination findings are useful in the determination of severity. Assessment of severity will dictate the initial management and disposition of the injured child [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. High-risk trauma mechanisms predict patients who are more likely to be unstable or become unstable and, along with vital signs and physical findings, are often used to guide prehospital transport decisions and to initiate evaluation by a trauma team in hospital trauma centers  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424" href="/z/d/graphic/60424.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293" href="/z/d/graphic/57293.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57153" href="/z/d/graphic/57153.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6459.html" rel="external">"Classification of trauma in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">BLUNT TRAUMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blunt injury accounts for approximately 90 percent of all pediatric trauma. When blunt force is applied to a child's small body, multisystem trauma occurs frequently. However, the majority of injuries are mild to moderate in severity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Initial evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of the pediatric patient with a history of mild or moderate blunt trauma begins with the primary and secondary surveys according to the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/z/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65952" href="/z/d/graphic/65952.html" rel="external">table 6</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The stable pediatric trauma patient should have a normal primary survey with the possible exception of tachycardia caused by age-appropriate anxiety and crying or mild lethargy (Glasgow coma scale ≥14)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/z/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">table 7</a>).</p><p>During the secondary survey, the emergency provider determines the injury extent (multiple trauma or isolated trauma), injury type (blunt or penetrating), and injury severity based on all physical findings.</p><p>The primary and secondary surveys may be truncated in the setting of trivial trauma or obviously isolated trauma (eg, struck on the knee by a baseball, twisted ankle, or fall on an outstretched arm). All other children should undergo a complete physical examination to ensure that subtle findings of significant injury are not missed.</p><p>Based on the initial brief history and physical assessment, injuries in each anatomic region in children with blunt trauma can be classified as mild (eg, isolated bruise), moderate (eg, head trauma with loss of consciousness), or severe (eg, liver laceration after blunt trauma)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57153" href="/z/d/graphic/57153.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). The severity of injuries may be estimated as a guide to management. This preliminary estimate is based upon the amount of force and mechanism of injury, the physical examination findings, including the vital signs, and evidence of superficial versus internal injuries. Further diagnostic evaluation depends upon the clinical assessment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H165891447"><span class="h2">Approach by injury location</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3739419866"><span class="h3">Head trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most children evaluated in the emergency department (ED) for blunt head trauma have sustained a minor injury and require no further intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127071.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in children (≥2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>A clinical decision rule identifying those at low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury has been derived and validated in a large, multicenter cohort and is shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477" href="/z/d/graphic/58477.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). Low-risk patients who do not undergo neuroimaging should meet all of these criteria. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6559.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in infants and young children (&lt;2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Clinical decision rules'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to neuroimaging for stable infants and children with minor head trauma who do <strong>not</strong> meet low-risk criteria for significant traumatic brain injury and further discussion of clinical decision rules are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6559.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in infants and young children (&lt;2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Approach'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6559.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in infants and young children (&lt;2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Clinical decision rules'</a>.)</p><p>For the large majority of infants and children with minor head trauma, management is based upon clinical findings rather than results of neuroimaging. For the few patients with clinically important traumatic brain injury, specific management is determined by the type of injury. Prompt neurosurgical consultation should be obtained in the patients with the following clinically important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBI) or skull fractures:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Parenchymal brain injury or intracranial hemorrhage detected by computed tomography (CT) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6534.html" rel="external">"Intracranial subdural hematoma in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6519.html" rel="external">"Intracranial epidural hematoma in children"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depressed, basilar, or widely diastatic skull fracture (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6563.html" rel="external">"Skull fractures in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Basilar skull fractures'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6563.html" rel="external">"Skull fractures in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Depressed skull fractures'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Deteriorating clinical condition (eg, Glasgow coma scale ≤13 or rapidly decreasing) regardless of neuroimaging results (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6566.html" rel="external">"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children: Initial evaluation and management"</a>)</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, almost all infants and children who have had isolated minor head trauma can be safely discharged following evaluation. Observation is still important even in discharged patients because signs and symptoms of traumatic brain injury may arise and warrant prompt return to the ED for reevaluation. Thus, clear instructions should be provided and the presence of responsible caretakers who can return in a timely manner, if necessary, should be assured. The clinician should also determine, based upon the clinical scenario (eg, age and symptoms of child, time since injury, time of day, home distance from hospital, and perceived quality of caregiver observation), whether emergency department or hospital observation is necessary and, if it is necessary, how long observation should last. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93336.html" rel="external">"Minor head trauma in infants and children: Management", section on 'Discharge instructions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93336.html" rel="external">"Minor head trauma in infants and children: Management", section on 'Minor head trauma'</a>.)</p><p>The assessment and management of concussion in children and adolescents is discussed separately.

Otherwise, the patient should undergo cervical spine motion restriction and evaluation and treatment for cervical spine injury as shown in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51439" href="/z/d/graphic/51439.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6329.html" rel="external">"Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p>Clinically cleared and previously healthy patients with mild injury mechanisms (eg, nine-year-old seat-belted passenger in a low speed motor vehicle collision [MVC]) and normal physical examination findings warrant no further specific management.</p><p>If the patient has a predisposition to cervical spine injury (eg, Down syndrome, Klippel Feil syndrome, Morquio syndrome, Larsen syndrome) or an underlying illness (eg, hemophilia) that may result in delayed complications, any clinical or radiographic findings suggestive of cervical spine or cord injury warrant further evaluation and early consultation with the appropriate specialist (eg, orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, or hematologist) is encouraged.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Thoracic trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to chest trauma in the hemodynamically stable patient is provided in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59720" href="/z/d/graphic/59720.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>). A patient with a history of minimal trauma to the chest (eg, a six-year-old punched by a classmate) with normal vital signs, breathing, and only superficial chest wall/skin injuries is unlikely to require radiologic imaging and may be discharged home.</p><p>The presence of abnormal vital signs (including oxygen saturation), a history of moderate thoracic trauma as defined by the amount of force involved (eg, a 15-year-old struck by a "fastball"), significant bony tenderness, or abnormal breath or cardiac sounds suggest potential intrathoracic injury. Patients with these findings warrant additional evaluation for potential life-threatening thoracic injury (eg, pulmonary contusion, cardiac contusion, and pneumothorax)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59720" href="/z/d/graphic/59720.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6568.html" rel="external">"Thoracic trauma in children: Initial stabilization and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6557.html" rel="external">"Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6569.html" rel="external">"Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Abdominal trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unlike penetrating trauma, which usually results in wounds that are apparent upon inspection, injuries caused by blunt abdominal trauma must be suspected from historical information, particularly the mechanism of injury, and careful physical examination. Repeated assessments are helpful to identify developing intraabdominal injuries over time when the mechanism of injury is concerning, particularly with perforations of the bowel as seen in lap belt injuries.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism of injury</strong> – Mechanisms of trauma that are associated with intraabdominal injury include high speed motor vehicle collision (MVC), especially without restraint or with seat belt but not shoulder strap usage, and falls from a height greater than 20 feet  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293" href="/z/d/graphic/57293.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). However, serious intraabdominal injury, especially splenic laceration or hematoma, can occur with seemingly trivial abdominal trauma to the left upper quadrant. For this reason, even abdominal trauma sustained as a result of minimal force (eg, a two-year-old struck by a ball) requires a thorough physical examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional findings</strong> – A clinical decision rule for the identification of children at very low risk for intra-abdominal (IAI) blunt injuries requiring acute intervention, defined as intra-abdominal injury associated with death, therapeutic intervention at laparotomy, angiographic embolization, blood transfusion for anemia, or intravenous fluids for &gt;2 nights has identified the following predictors of those at low risk (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Low-risk rule for intra-abdominal injury'</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Glasgow coma scale ≥14</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No evidence of abdominal wall trauma or seat belt sign</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No abdominal tenderness</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No complaints of abdominal pain</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No vomiting</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No thoracic wall trauma</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No decreased breath sounds</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who meet all criteria have an approximately 0.1 percent risk of an IAI and typically do <strong>not</strong> warrant extensive laboratory testing or abdominal CT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Low-risk rule for intra-abdominal injury'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Potential indications for laboratory evaluation and abdominal CT in children who do not meet these criteria or have other concerning findings after sustaining blunt abdominal trauma are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Approach'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a>.)</p><p>Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a rapid ultrasound examination of four abdominal locations (right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, subxiphoid region, and pelvis). Use of FAST in children with a clinical impression of low risk for IAI after initial evaluation does <strong>not</strong> appear to improve clinical outcomes and has low sensitivity for IAI when compared with abdominal CT [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. In the stable patient, the presence of intraperitoneal fluid on FAST typically indicates hemorrhage secondary to an intra-abdominal organ injury that should be examined further by an abdominal CT with intravenous contrast. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'e-FAST (extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma)'</a>.)</p><p>Pelvic radiographs add little to the evaluation and are not recommended in alert and hemodynamically stable patients unless the physical examination reveals pelvic tenderness and/or instability or the urinalysis shows hematuria [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast is the preferred imaging modality for the definitive evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in hemodynamically stable children. CT is sensitive and specific in diagnosing liver, spleen, and retroperitoneal injuries. CT is less sensitive in detecting injuries of the pancreas, intestinal tract, bladder, and lumbar spine. Based upon a systematic review of observational studies that reported outcomes on over 9000 children, asymptomatic children with a negative abdominal CT are very unlikely to have intraabdominal injuries [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Caregivers of children with a normal abdominal CT who are being discharged home should be instructed to seek medical care if the child develops worsening abdominal pain or vomiting, which has the potential to occur subacutely with intestinal tract injury [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

In the stable patient, the severity of the injury is primarily determined by the characteristics of the weapon and the location of the wound or wounds.
