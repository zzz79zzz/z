         Dyspnea, or breathing discomfort, is common during pregnancy. It is usually a physiologic result of pregnancy itself but can be caused by new or underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the normal changes in the respiratory system in pregnant people and physiologic dyspnea of pregnancy, as well as initial considerations for the differential diagnosis of nonphysiologic dyspnea during pregnancy and immediately postpartum. The definition, pathophysiology, and general approach to evaluation of acute and chronic nonphysiologic dyspnea in adults are reviewed in detail separately:

         Distinguishing physiologic dyspnea of pregnancy from other causes requires an understanding of the normal cardiovascular and pulmonary changes that occur during pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. The most striking normal cardiovascular changes in pregnancy are increased blood volume  (

          figure 1

        </p>
        <p>
         The normal pulmonary changes (described in the following sections) result in compensated respiratory alkalosis, with a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) and a higher partial pressure of oxygen (PO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) compared with the nonpregnant state. The lower PCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         supplies a diffusion gradient, which may help the fetus eliminate waste from aerobic metabolism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Interestingly, healthy patients carrying twins appear to have similar respiratory function as those with a singleton pregnancy [

         Functional residual capacity (FRC) decreases by approximately 20 percent during the latter half of pregnancy, due to a decrease in both expiratory reserve volume (ERV) and residual volume  (

         Variable changes in vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (TLC) occur, but they are generally small and probably not clinically significant.

         Airway function and flow rates are preserved during pregnancy, as reflected by an unchanged forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and an unchanged FEV1/FVC ratio.

         Resting minute ventilation rises by nearly 50 percent at term. This is primarily due to a larger tidal volume (increased up to 40 percent), whereas the respiratory rate remains essentially unchanged [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The increase in ventilation is greater than the corresponding increase in oxygen consumption (approximately 20 percent)  (

        <p>
         Higher progesterone levels during pregnancy are probably responsible for the rise in ventilation above that explained by the enhanced metabolic requirements. Progesterone is a stimulant of respiration and respiratory drive, and its concentration gradually rises from approximately 25 ng/mL at 6 weeks to 150 ng/mL at term [

         Maternal oxygenation is preserved during pregnancy. In fact, maternal PaO

         is generally increased because of hyperventilation, ranging from 106 to 108 mmHg in the first trimester to 101 to 104 mmHg in the third trimester [

         The mechanism is not entirely clear. Because it initially occurs while the uterus is still relatively small, it cannot be attributed solely to upward pressure on the diaphragm. Progesterone-induced hyperventilation is likely to be at least partially responsible, perhaps due to the increase in ventilation above the level needed to meet the rise in metabolic demand. Clinical observations are consistent with this hypothesis. In one observational study, dyspnea during pregnancy correlated with a low partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ), and the individuals most likely to experience dyspnea were those who had relatively high baseline (ie, nonpregnant) PaCO

         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Studies at 38 weeks of gestation showed a slight but statistically significant increase in septal and posterior wall thickness and pulmonary artery pressure in those with dyspnea. There were also echocardiographic changes suggesting subtle diastolic dysfunction. However, the values for pregnant patients with dyspnea were not outside of the normal range, and whether these patients with significant dyspnea were representative of those with less severe dyspnea of pregnancy is not known.

         When a pregnant or recently pregnant patient reports dyspnea, distinguishing between underlying disease (eg, asthma)  (

         ), a new problem (eg, pulmonary embolism, peripartum cardiomyopathy, infection), and progesterone-induced hyperventilation (dyspnea of pregnancy) can be a difficult diagnostic problem [

         ].

        <p>
         A key principle is that dyspnea of pregnancy is an isolated finding; it is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         accompanied by other signs and symptoms such as cough, wheezing, fever, tachypnea, pleuritic or other chest pain, hemoptysis, sputum production, hypoxemia, tachycardia, irregular heart rhythm, or immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions (eg, urticaria). It typically begins in the first or second trimester and gradually progresses. Imaging, pulse oximetry, and laboratory test results are normal for pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The differential diagnosis is also influenced by the stage of pregnancy. In the first half of pregnancy, the differential diagnosis, other than dyspnea of pregnancy, is similar to that in nonpregnant patients. Later in pregnancy (especially the third trimester) or postpartum, pregnancy-related etiologies, such as preeclampsia with severe features, peripartum cardiomyopathy, pulmonary or amniotic fluid embolism, and sepsis, should also be considered.

          Is the patient known to have underlying asthma or other pulmonary disease?
         </strong>
         – The most common underlying disorder potentially causing dyspnea in females of child-bearing age is asthma. There is no predictable effect of pregnancy on preexisting asthma, as approximately equal percentages of patients experience worsening, improvement, or no change in the course of their asthma during pregnancy. Pregnant patients with mild asthma can often be managed by their primary care clinician. Those with moderate to severe asthma, or a less common underlying pulmonary disease, ideally should be managed by a pulmonary specialist and/or a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. (See

          Is the patient known to have underlying heart disease?
         </strong>
         – The most common underlying heart diseases with the potential to cause dyspnea during pregnancy are congenital heart disease and valvular heart disease. Dyspnea may be worse at night or when lying down. Pregnant patients with underlying heart disease should be managed by a cardiologist and often by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist as well. (See

          Pulmonary embolism
         </strong>
         – In addition to the sudden onset of dyspnea, other common findings suggesting pulmonary embolism are tachypnea and pleuritic chest pain, which do not occur with normal dyspnea of pregnancy. Heart rate may increase above the elevated baseline rate of normal pregnancy. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is often low with acute pulmonary embolism, but normal oxygen saturation does not exclude this diagnosis. (See

         <strong>
          Acute upper airway obstruction
         </strong>
         – Acute dyspnea from upper airway obstruction is a symptom of anaphylaxis and is often accompanied by other symptoms of an acute IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (eg, flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, tachycardia, hypotension). A history of exposure to a causative agent  (

          Wheezing
         </strong>
         – Wheezing indicates airflow obstruction and, in the reproductive age group, is most suggestive of underlying asthma or acute bronchitis.

Other less common causes of wheezing include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, extrathoracic disease (eg, anaphylaxis or vocal cord edema or paralysis), or other intrathoracic disorders affecting airway patency. These discussions are presented in detail elsewhere.

         – Clues to the need for an urgent evaluation include heart rate &gt;120 beats/minute, respiratory rate &gt;24 breaths/minute, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ) &lt;95 percent, use of accessory respiratory muscles, difficulty speaking in full sentences, stridor, asymmetric breath sounds or percussion, diffuse rales, diaphoresis, neck or substernal chest pain, cyanosis, hemoptysis, depressed or agitated mental status, and oropharyngeal swelling.

         <strong>
          Initial approach
         </strong>
         – The history and physical examination lead to accurate diagnoses in most patients with dyspnea. For patients in whom additional information is needed to make a diagnosis, but are not thought to have a pulmonary embolus, chest radiography and/or pulmonary function testing are typically the first tests obtained  (

          table 4
         </a>
         ). Hematocrit or hemoglobin should also be checked to assess whether moderate or severe anemia may be causing or contributing to dyspnea. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial laboratory and imaging tests'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Additional testing
         </strong>
         – Additional testing can include imaging for patients with suspected pulmonary embolus  (

          algorithm 1

         ), or brain natriuretic peptide levels or echocardiography for patients with a suspected cardiac cause of dyspnea. (See
