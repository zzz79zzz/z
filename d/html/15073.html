Postoperative intravenous maintenance fluid therapy ensures adequate organ perfusion, prevents catabolism, ensures electrolyte- and pH-balance, and may be all that is required for patients who undergo surgical procedures that do not significantly alter the hemodynamic milieu. Typically, such procedures are associated with a small volume of blood loss (&lt;250 mL), a short course of anesthesia and surgery (&lt;3 hours), a small volume of intravenous fluid administration (&lt;30 mL/kg), and little to no extravascular fluid shift in patients without significant organ dysfunction.</p><p>However, in many cases, postoperative patients with extensive traumatic or surgical tissue injury, burns, critical illness, or sepsis require more complex resuscitative fluid therapy in addition to maintenance therapy to compensate for preoperative and intraoperative losses, the stress response to surgery, the underlying disease state, ongoing fluid and blood loss. Such complex fluid management is often needed for patients who undergo surgical procedures that result in significant blood loss (&gt;500 mL or 7 mL/kg) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], fluid shifting out of the vascular space ("third-spacing"), large-volume intravenous fluid administration (&gt;30 mL/kg), or hemodynamic instability [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>The prescription of maintenance and resuscitative fluids in postoperative surgical patients is reviewed here. The management of electrolyte abnormalities and nutritional support in the perioperative period are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106524.html" rel="external">"Overview of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2880.html" rel="external">"Overview of perioperative nutrition support"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104221.html" rel="external">"Postoperative parenteral nutrition in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Intraoperative fluid therapy is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14942.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative fluid management"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1331954772"><span class="h1">PHYSIOLOGIC STRESS RESPONSE TO SURGERY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The stress response to traumatic or surgical tissue injury is a primal collection of biochemical pathways designed to facilitate survival following a major insult. The "fight or flight" response promotes expansion of the blood volume, glucose availability, perfusion of vital organs, and inflammation. This stress response is triggered by entry into a major body cavity (eg, chest, abdomen, joint, cranium), significant tissue disruption (eg, severe burn wounds, long bone fracture, penetrating gunshot wound, pancreatitis), significant blood loss (&gt;500 mL or 7 mL/kg), hemodynamic instability, and sepsis.</p><p>Some devices and treatments used in surgery may also incite a massive inflammatory response. As an example, extracorporeal bypass uses an external circuit through which blood is forced for gas exchange and circulation while the patient undergoes cardiac surgery. Blood contact with artificial bypass tubing incites cytokine release, activation of the coagulation cascade, and the production of nitric oxide [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This inflammatory response may lead to vasodilation, deranged coagulation, systemic capillary leak, and systemic organ dysfunction. Another example is aggressive cancer treatment using heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), which commonly results in an inflammatory response marked by supranormal fluid exudation, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and coagulopathy [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Derangements in physiology, intravascular volume, and coagulation associated with HIPEC commonly require aggressive fluid resuscitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1625.html" rel="external">"Extracorporeal life support in adults in the intensive care unit: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121546.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for cytoreductive surgery with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3471303490"><span class="h2">Hormonal mediators</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hormonal mediators of the stress response include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vasopressin – Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland in response to elevated plasma osmolality, low circulating blood volume, and stress. This results in water retention by the kidney, which expands the vascular volume. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aldosterone – The renin-angiotensin axis responds to volume contraction by stimulating aldosterone secretion in the adrenal gland. Aldosterone increases sodium and water retention by the kidney, thereby expanding the vascular volume.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cortisol – The hypothalamic-pituitary axis responds to stress by stimulating cortisol release from the adrenal gland. This promotes gluconeogenesis and muscle breakdown and results in hyperglycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Catecholamines – Epinephrine and norepinephrine are released from the adrenal gland in response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation, resulting in vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and catabolism. This combination leads to increased cardiac output, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cytokines – Acute phase reactants (eg, interleukins 1 and 6) generate a local inflammatory response at the site of injury, facilitating healing at sites of tissue disruption [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p></p><p>The stress response to tissue injury helps the body to compensate for hypovolemia. However, complications of the stress response can occur. As an example, aldosterone release leads to acute potassium wasting and secondary hypokalemia. If not appropriately treated, severe postoperative hypokalemia can result in arrhythmia. Similarly, cortisol and catecholamines contribute to hyperglycemia, which is associated with complications of wound healing in postoperative patients, including infection, dehiscence, and nonhealing. Furthermore, the systemic release of inflammatory mediators may result in local and/or systemic capillary leak, tissue injury, and systemic organ dysfunction (eg, acute renal failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome). </p><p>Distinguishing hypovolemia from the stress response in the postoperative patient can be challenging. In the past, manifestations of the stress response, including tachycardia, hypotension, and oliguria, were attributed to hypovolemia and inadequate fluid resuscitation. For this reason, postoperative fluid resuscitation was focused on resolving these physiologic derangements by administering large volumes of fluid. Such aggressive fluid resuscitation resulted in complications associated with volume overload, contributing to morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>].</p><p>Our understanding of the stress response to surgery has evolved. In a 2016 statement on sepsis, the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recognized that a stress response exists as a spectrum of organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In the absence of infection (eg, pancreatitis), an exaggerated stress response can result in a similar degree of organ dysfunction. As such, organ dysfunction (ie, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, or cardiomyopathy) in the postoperative patient may not reflect inadequate fluid resuscitation; rather, such dysfunction may be a manifestation of a pathologic stress response to the underlying disease or to surgery [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. For this reason, new protocols, such as the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol, are emerging to limit the fluid therapy in surgical patients and may include "permissive oliguria" in some cases [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H945124557"><span class="h1">FLUID LOSS AFTER SURGERY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fluid loss in the postoperative period varies widely with the type of procedure performed, the condition of the patient at the time of surgery, the underlying disease for which the procedure was performed, and the severity of the stress response. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1478800851"><span class="h2">Bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bleeding should always be considered in postoperative patients with hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, or pallor. However, these manifestations are late, occurring only after blood loss is in excess of 15 percent of the patient's blood volume  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107655" href="/z/d/graphic/107655.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). While fluid administration is appropriate to support the patient, blood products are often required to correct the acute blood loss anemia. In the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, 1 L of fluid is indicated for trauma patients requiring resuscitation to restore organ perfusion; thereafter, in cases of bleeding, balanced transfusional support is encouraged [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112610.html" rel="external">"Intraoperative transfusion and administration of clotting factors"</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, a return to the operating room is indicated for exploration and control of hemorrhage at the surgical site. In cases of occult bleeding, imaging may be needed to identify the bleeding source. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1035924462"><span class="h2">Drainage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gastrointestinal drainage systems (eg, nasogastric tube) may evacuate large volumes of fluid during or following a surgical procedure (eg, small bowel obstruction)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107239" href="/z/d/graphic/107239.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Similarly, surgical entry into the chest (ie, pleural fluid from a chest tube), abdomen (ie, ascites from abdominal drains), or urinary system (ie, urine) may lead to the rapid evacuation of a large volume of fluid. For fluid evacuation in excess of one liter, hypovolemia and electrolyte derangement may result if the fluid is not sufficiently replaced to restore normal perfusion. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4005841940"><span class="h2">Third-spacing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Third-spacing refers to the process of capillary leak and extravasation of protein-rich serum into the interstitial spaces of the soft tissues (eg, skin, fat, muscle), organs, deep space cavities (eg, chest, abdomen), or retroperitoneum. It typically occurs during the first 72 hours following major surgery and is associated with a heightened stress response [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Third-spacing into the soft tissue results in edema, whereas fluid that leaks from the peritoneal or pleural surfaces generates ascites or pleural effusion. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large nonanatomic cavities, such as those created from extensive subcutaneous dissection or following drainage of an infected pancreatic pseudocyst, can result in large-volume third-spacing into the newly created potential space. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spaces that are created during surgery (eg, the hernia cavity that remains following ventral hernia repair), in which the tissues are not approximated, can result in postoperative seroma. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reperfusion following an episode of ischemia, such as in cases of arterial occlusion, result in an intense local inflammatory response and extensive tissue edema, which can lead to compartment syndrome.</p><p></p><p>Hypoalbuminemia contributes to third-spacing; it is theorized that the resultant intravascular oncotic pressure, resulting from hypoalbuminemia, contributes to the fluid shifting. Some fluids contain higher concentrations of albumin, such as ascites, which may impact hemodynamics in a more impressive way. As an example, in a post hoc analysis of 31 patients involved in a trial to assess intravenous fluid administration following cytoreductive surgery, the evacuation of malignant ascites in excess of 500 mL caused greater hemodynamic instability and was associated with a larger fluid resuscitation compared with those in whom less than 500 mL ascites was drained [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2298.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1314990761"><span class="h2">Insensible losses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Insensible<strong> </strong>(evaporative) loss can be related to prolonged exposure during laparotomy or thoracotomy, or prolonged exposure of burn wounds during skin grafting. Older studies estimated that the losses from open abdominal exposure were 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/hour; however, the amount varies with the degree of organ exposure and the severity of the illness. Minimally invasive approaches are associated with less evaporative loss. Postoperatively, insensible losses can also occur through large open wounds, such as an open abdomen or burn wounds, and with persistent postoperative fever.</p><p>Insensible loss associated with ventilator support (intraoperative, postoperative) is limited.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2501608345"><span class="h1">FLUID RESUSCITATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of postoperative fluid resuscitation is to restore organ perfusion [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Through the administration of intravenous fluid, a deficit in intravascular volume is sufficiently replaced to restore organ perfusion. In some cases, blood transfusion is also necessary to achieve these goals. </p><p>Despite advances in critical care, there is no way to directly measure intravascular volume [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. For this reason, we continue to rely on markers of inadequate perfusion to guide us in identifying hypovolemia. Any patient who demonstrates hemodynamic instability (ie, tachycardia, hypotension), end-organ dysfunction (eg, alteration in mental status, oliguria [&lt;0.5 mL/kg]), lactic acidosis, or base deficit in the postoperative period should be considered for fluid resuscitation. </p><p>Postoperative fluid resuscitation begins with the identification of clinically impactful fluid loss resulting in hypovolemia, which may be due to any of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preoperative fluid deficit (eg, bowel preparation-associated diarrhea) or fasting-associated deficit (eg, prolonged inanition prior to intestinal surgery).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraoperative sensible and insensible fluid losses.

(See <a class="local">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ongoing fluid loss related to the underlying condition (eg, septic shock, pancreatitis), which can be due to tissue (third-spacing) or external (eg, surgical drain, nasogastric tube) losses. (See <a class="local">'Third-spacing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Drainage'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1112784206"><span class="h2">Estimate the fluid deficit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, fluid resuscitation was achieved by estimating and replacing the intravascular fluid deficit. However, the estimation of a patient's fluid deficit is an inexact science; by this method, many patients receive too much fluid. In simple cases, replacing some or all of the deficit is sufficient to complete resuscitation. In complex cases involving physiologic derangement (eg, hypotension, tachycardia), acute organ dysfunction (eg, acute kidney injury, sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy), or systemic illness (eg, vasodilation due to septic shock), resuscitation may be more complex. For this reason, resuscitation is focused on restoring normal perfusion rather than replacing an estimated volume deficit. </p><p>Blood collected from the operating field through closed suction evacuation is often readily apparent and measurable; however, some of this blood may have been collected and returned to the patient using autotransfusion technology. The estimate of the volume of blood lost on surgical sponges may also be difficult since the amount of estimated blood varies with the sponge size, sponge material, and degree of sponge saturation (ie, volumes range from a few mL to 100 mL per saturated sponge). In addition, the amount on a sponge may be overestimated as blood may be mixed with ascites or urine. Conversely, blood loss can be underestimated, as blood may also be lost on surgical gowns, drapes, and the operating room floor. Occult blood loss will not have been accounted for. As an example, a significant retroperitoneal hematoma due to arterial cannulation may not be apparent until much later, as the patient develops symptoms (eg, pain, ileus) or becomes hypotensive.</p><p>In hypovolemic patients, it may not be possible to reliably calculate the fluid deficit. Instead, it is a common practice to compare the physiologic parameters associated with hypovolemia to those associated with hemorrhage  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107655" href="/z/d/graphic/107655.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). As an example, with &lt;15 percent circulating blood volume loss, the heart rate and blood pressure should be normal. If a patient demonstrates tachycardia or hypotension, it is likely that their volume deficit is greater than 15 percent. For a 70 kg individual, a 15 percent deficit would correspond to approximately 750 mL fluid deficit. While this method is not well supported with literature and is imprecise, it provides a good starting point. For this reason, the volume of intravenous fluid administered as a bolus (referred to as a fluid challenge) is often 500 mL to 1000 mL [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1138385098"><span class="h2">Measure ongoing fluid losses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to replacing any postoperative fluid deficit, ongoing losses from drainage tubes must be accounted for. Provided the surgical drains are functioning properly, the volume of loss can be measured directly. We monitor drain output frequently; when it exceeds 400 mL in 8 hours (&gt;50 mL/hour), fluid replacement is initiated to minimize fluid deficits and secondary hypovolemia, until the drain output subsides. Alternatively, we may begin replacing the output in a scheduled fashion (eg, 1 L every 12 hours), assuming the observed loss will continue at the same pace. These replacement protocols (hourly, every six hours, or intermittent bolus) can be revised several times a day, depending on the trend in output.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H340526809"><span class="h2">Volume of replacement fluid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the fluid deficit has been estimated and ongoing losses are measured, the total volume of replacement fluid can be determined. For hemodynamically stable patients, ongoing fluid losses should be evaluated and adjusted daily; fluid needs should be assessed two or three times daily in critically ill patients. </p><p>The postoperative patient can be expected to require a volume that is up to three times the estimated fluid deficit. As much as two-thirds of administered intravenous crystalloids are expected to shift out of the vascular space within hours of administration due to capillary leak, which correlates with the magnitude of the stress response to surgery. For patients with normal organ function, the fluid deficit is typically replaced in a ratio of 1:1, meaning that 1 L of fluid loss is replaced with 1 L of fluid replacement. Greater amounts with ratios as high as 3:1 may be necessary in those with a severe stress response to surgery (eg, after necrosectomy for necrotizing pancreatitis). Lower amounts (eg, 0.5 mL:1 mL) are used in those expected to receive a large volume of other fluids, such as medications or blood products, and in those who are not expected to tolerate excessive fluid volume (eg, recovery after kidney transplant). In the REstrictive versus LIbEral Fluid therapy (RELIEF) trial, 2983 patients with risk factors for complications (ie, &gt;70 years of age, heart disease, diabetes, renal dysfunction, morbid obesity) were randomly assigned to restrictive (ie, zero balance) versus liberal fluid therapy during and after abdominal surgery [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of pulmonary edema or duration of mechanical ventilation, but those assigned to a restrictive protocol had a higher rate of acute kidney injury (8.6 versus 5.0 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.71 95% CI 1.29-2.27) and need for replacement therapy (0.9 versus 0.3 percent; HR 3.27, 95% CI 1.01-13.8). The rate of surgical site infection was also increased (16.5 versus 13.6 percent; HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.45), but the incidences of other infectious complications (eg, sepsis, anastomotic leak, pneumonia) were no different. At one year, disability-free survival was no different between the groups (81.9 versus 82.3 percent). These findings suggest that a modestly liberal intraoperative and postoperative fluid regimen is needed to maintain renal perfusion in high-risk patients. For other subsets of patients, their postoperative physiology may be the reason that fluid replacement will be poorly tolerated. An example is the patient who undergoes pneumonectomy, whose remaining lung must acutely accommodate an entire blood volume. In such patients, smaller amounts of fluid are often used for replacement; permissive oliguria is often preferable to volume overload-associated pulmonary edema.</p><p>Ongoing gastrointestinal or other losses are generally replaced with a volume equal to the loss. These losses can be replaced periodically (eg, every six hours). Alternatively, a fluid replacement protocol can be employed to keep up with losses on an hourly basis once a goal vascular volume is achieved. As an example, during kidney transplantation, the patient is volume-loaded during surgery until the intravascular system is replete. Thereafter, each hour after surgery, the amount of fluid lost is measured and replaced using an equal volume of intravenous fluid during the following hour. In this way, the intravascular volume is maintained, and a fluid deficit is avoided. If large-volume losses are anticipated, the maintenance fluid goal rate can be increased temporarily.

In the setting of acute blood loss, more rapid transfusion may be needed to treat a patient in shock. Emergency rooms, trauma bays, intensive care units, and operating rooms have ready access to a rapid transfuser, which permits the rapid transfusion of warmed fluid and blood products at high rates (300 to 500 mL/minute).

Normal perfusion is achieved when the end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle generates an adequate stroke volume. To achieve normal organ perfusion, blood volume must be restored to 80 to 85 percent of normal blood volume.</p><p>Although some clinical parameters and bedside examination may be helpful for assessing the adequacy of perfusion, laboratory measurements (ie, serum base deficit and serum lactic acid) and adequate intracardiac filling by echocardiography are better measures of adequate central volume. Approximately one-half of hemodynamically unstable patients will remain fluid responsive at the end of their initial resuscitation, further strengthening the argument to use endpoints of resuscitation rather than fluid responsiveness [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. If a patient becomes unresponsive to fluid replacement, further fluid administration should be reconsidered to avoid complications of volume overload. </p><p>Since normal organ perfusion can be achieved without complete replacement of the estimated volume deficit for most patients, ongoing clinical assessment of the adequacy of organ perfusion is essential. In relatively healthy individuals who have not sustained large-volume blood or fluid loss, normalization of heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, and mental status mark the return of normal end-organ perfusion. A 45° passive leg raise in a recumbent patient can be helpful for evaluating fluid responsiveness, which is defined as an increase in stroke volume by more than 10 percent [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. For the average adult monitored with a noninvasive cardiac output monitor, a passive leg raise is equivalent to a fluid bolus of approximately 300 mL (4 mL/kg). In one study of 72 elderly surgical patients, a passive leg raise correlated with a stroke volume rise of 10 percent in most patients who were fluid responsive. [<a href="#rid40">40</a>] </p><p>Serum lactic acid, base deficit, and central venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) are biochemical end-products of perfusion that are often used to confirm adequacy of end-organ perfusion in patients demonstrating complex physiology (eg, concurrent sepsis and vasodilatory shock). Trending values every four to eight hours is helpful. When a patient develops hypovolemia, impaired organ perfusion leads to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid. Lactic acid is buffered by base; it consumes the base, thereby creating a base deficit. Similarly, underperfused tissues will extract a greater percentage of oxygen than is normal, resulting in a decreased SvO<sub>2</sub>. As blood volume is restored, these parameters should trend toward normal. However, resolution of lactic acidosis is highly variable in its time course. Outcomes of surgical patients with lactic acidosis have not been as well studied as in the medical patient population [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. However, lactic acidosis exceeding 4.0 mmol/L has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in emergency room patients with infection [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Serum lactic acid levels must be interpreted with caution in patients with liver dysfunction, who may not clear lactic acid as quickly compared with those who have normal liver function. Acute liver dysfunction can be observed in a variety of surgical settings (eg, sepsis, trauma, transplant). For patients with persistently elevated lactic acid and SvO<sub>2</sub>, in spite of adequate fluid resuscitation, further evaluation is warranted. </p><p>Estimates of central blood volume, including central venous pressure, the change in central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure are not good estimates of central blood volume [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Several meta-analyses have demonstrated the lack of evidence to support their use as endpoints of resuscitation [<a href="#rid43">43-45</a>]. These are being abandoned in favor of goal-directed therapy, using biochemical markers (discussed in the preceding paragraph) or functional estimates of central volume by echocardiography to establish real-time intracardiac hemodynamics [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>].

In such patients, the fluid goal is typically decreased by 50 to 75 percent, and, in some cases, permissive oliguria is accepted. Restrictive protocols have also been used after pneumonectomy, liver resection, and in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) settings with variable results. The most common downside to restrictive strategies used in the postoperative settings appears to be hypovolemia-associated hypotension and acute kidney injury. In a composite study of 1031 patients who underwent thoracotomy, a restrictive fluid strategy was associated with a higher incidence of composite complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, bronchopleural fistula) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Maintenance fluids</strong> – Maintenance fluids maintain hydration, electrolyte, and acid-base status and avoid catabolism in postoperative patients who cannot tolerate oral or enteral intake. (See <a class="local">'Maintenance fluid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stress response to surgery</strong> – The extent to which fluids administered intravenously in the postoperative period remain in the intravascular space depends on many factors, including the severity of the stress response to surgery. The stress response to surgery is triggered by (see <a class="local">'Physiologic stress response to surgery'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Entry into a major body cavity</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant tissue disruption </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant blood loss (&gt;500 mL or 7 mL/kg)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hemodynamic instability</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe infection </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Estimating fluid losses </strong>– For fluid resuscitation, the type and volume of fluid that is lost guides the choice, volume, and rate of replacement. The fluid deficit is determined by estimating preoperative and intraoperative losses and subtracting the volume of fluid and blood given during the surgery. Ongoing gastrointestinal and other losses should be considered. (See <a class="local">'Estimate the fluid deficit'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endpoints of fluid resuscitation</strong> – The goal of fluid resuscitation is normal organ perfusion, which is achieved when the end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle generates an adequate stroke volume. To achieve normal organ perfusion, blood volume must be restored to 80 to 85 percent of normal blood volume. Physiologic markers of adequate perfusion include normalization of heart rate and blood pressure in healthy patients but may be unreliable in critically ill patients. (See <a class="local">'Endpoints of fluid resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serum markers of adequate perfusion include lactic acid, base deficit, and central venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>). Adequate intracardiac filling can be measured with echocardiography. As blood volume is restored, these parameters should trend toward normal. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If a patient becomes unresponsive to fluid replacement, fluid therapy should be reconsidered to avoid complications of volume overload. For patients who do not respond appropriately to fluid challenge or have a persistently elevated lactic acid and SvO<sub>2</sub>, in spite of adequate fluid resuscitation, further evaluation in a closely monitored setting is warranted to identify bleeding or other complications of surgery (eg, acute renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fluid selection</strong> – Crystalloid solutions remain the fluid of choice for replacement and maintenance fluid therapy following surgery. (See <a class="local">'Fluid selection and rate'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Replacement fluids</strong> – For fluid replacement, isotonic or hypertonic fluids are used because their sodium content facilitates volume expansion  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107900" href="/z/d/graphic/107900.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), maintains serum osmolarity, and retains water in the vascular space. The choice is governed by the composition of the fluid that is lost. Resuscitative fluids are commonly administered as successive intravenous boluses (3.5 to 14 mL/kg aliquots) over 30 to 60 minutes until the desired response is observed (eg, improved urine output, improved mentation, normalizing base deficit). Rapid onset hypothermia can occur when large volumes of room-temperature fluid are administered. If this is anticipated, we suggest using a Level 1 rapid transfuser, which warms the fluid as it is infused. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Maintenance fluids</strong> – For maintenance fluid therapy, isotonic or hypotonic solutions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107900" href="/z/d/graphic/107900.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) with or without additives (eg, dextrose, potassium) are used to maintain normal acid-base status, electrolytes, and volume status. For postoperative patients with normal organ function, a volume of maintenance fluid between 1 and 1.5 mL/kg/hour will meet requirements. Adjustments may be required to account for organ dysfunction, intravenous medications, or nutritional therapies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Caloric support</strong> – In the absence of a shock state or hyperglycemia, dextrose can be added to maintenance fluid to provide a minimal number of calories (up to 500 calories per day) to stimulate basal insulin secretion and prevent catabolism. However, after five days muscle breakdown will occur unless nutritional support, preferably via enteral access, is instituted. (See <a class="local">'Fluid selection and rate'</a> above and <a class="local">'Monitoring and adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Enteral intake should be established before maintenance fluids are titrated down or discontinued. Some patients may continue to require a modified amount of intravenous fluid until improved enteral intake is demonstrated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For those patients who do not tolerate enteral intake, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> may be indicated. The parenteral nutrition rate is increased as maintenance fluid is decreased in equal volumes to maintain the goal infusion rate per hour over several hours. </p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Schulman S, Kearon C, Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.
