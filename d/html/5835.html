The majority are benign, including inflammatory lesions or follicular adenomas, but up to 25 percent are malignant.</p><p>The thyroid gland in children is particularly susceptible to irradiation and carcinogenesis, which may explain why children with thyroid cancer tend to present with advanced disease. Compared with adults, children with thyroid cancer display a greater frequency of lymph node metastases and distant metastases at the time of diagnosis and higher rates of recurrence. Despite these characteristics, children with thyroid cancer generally have a good prognosis.</p><p>The evaluation of a child presenting with a thyroid nodule and an overview of the treatment of thyroid cancer are discussed in this topic review. Congenital and acquired goiter and thyroid cysts are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5844.html" rel="external">"Approach to congenital goiter in newborns and infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120705.html" rel="external">"Approach to acquired goiter in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid nodules</strong> – In a study of 5179 schoolchildren between the ages of 11 and 18 years conducted in the southwestern United States, thyroid nodules detectable by palpation were present in 1.8 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In a study of 440 schoolchildren aged 5 to 18 years in Athens, Greece, thyroid nodules were present in 5.1 percent by ultrasonography [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. By contrast, a survey of nearly 300,000 infants and children around Fukushima intended to document the baseline rate of nodules around the time of the 2011 nuclear accident reported that only 0.76 percent had nodules larger than 5 mm detected by ultrasound examination [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The differences in the prevalence of thyroid nodules among these three populations may be explained by different genetic makeup or environmental risk factors (such as iodine sufficiency) or variation in ultrasound technique or interpretation. In a group of children without suspected thyroid disease who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest, thyroid nodules were detected in 1.4 percent, which is much lower than the rate of unsuspected thyroid nodules detected on CT in adults [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Thyroid nodules increase in prevalence during adolescence: In the Fukushima study, nodules larger than 5 mm were present in 0.3 percent of children under age 15 years but in 1.7 percent of those age 15 to 19 years [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The prevalence of thyroid nodules is equal in females and males prior to 10 years of age, but nodules are approximately twice as common in females as in males after this age, perhaps because of pubertal effects that are not well understood.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malignant thyroid tumors</strong> – Most thyroid nodules in children are benign, but the percentage of nodules harboring cancer in children is higher than the rate of 5 to 15 percent in adults. Rates of malignancy among pediatric nodules evaluated clinically by ultrasound range from 19 to 34 percent [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. In a study that used a standardized diagnostic process for thyroid nodules, the rate of cancer was 19 percent in children, compared with 12 percent in adults [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, the malignancy rate appears to be lower (4 to 6 percent) in nodules discovered incidentally on ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging performed for other indications [<a href="#rid4">4,10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in children is increasing worldwide [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A large registry study reported a total of 1806 pediatric patients (&lt;20 years of age) diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 1973 and 2013, with an annual incidence of 0.60 cases per 100,000 population [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The annual incidence was 0.48 cases per 100,000 person-years in 1973 and increased to 1.14 cases per 100,000 in 2013. The annual percent change rose gradually between 1973 and 2006 and then increased sharply to 9.56 percent between 2006 and 2013. Another study reported a similar 3 to 4 percent increase between 1984 and 2010 for children, adolescents, and young adults [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. This increase appears to be a result of both enhanced detection and a true increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prepubertal children with thyroid cancer tend to have more advanced disease at presentation compared with adolescents and adults [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. This was illustrated in a review of 540 children from nine large centers, in which 71 to 90 percent of the children had cancer that spread to regional lymph nodes, 20 to 60 percent had extracapsular extension (some with invasion of the trachea), and 30 percent had involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Distant metastases are usually in the lungs or, rarely, in the bones or brain [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4053482027"><span class="h1">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1169671265"><span class="h2">Benign lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of thyroid nodules in children are benign (see <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above).

One-quarter of these are "follicular variant," a subtype of PTC. A "noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features" (NIFTP), previously referred to as a noninvasive follicular-variant PTC (FVPTC), was renamed NIFTP to highlight its indolent behavior and &lt;1 percent recurrence rate. These neoplasms are considered benign, but they have malignant potential, and surgical excision is required to confirm that they are noninvasive.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)</strong> – Follicular carcinoma accounts for 8 to 9 percent of pediatric thyroid cancers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)</strong> – Medullary carcinoma accounts for 4 percent of pediatric thyroid cancers but a higher proportion in young children [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

However, a minority of patients have specific risk factors for thyroid cancer, including ionizing radiation or a genetic predisposition.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ionizing radiation is the most common nongenetic risk factor for thyroid cancer in children. Young children (eg, younger than 10 years of age) are particularly susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of irradiation.</p><p>Most cases are related to exposure to external irradiation for treatment of nonthyroidal malignancies, including Hodgkin lymphoma or other tumors of the head and neck, or conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For children with this exposure, the increased risk for developing thyroid nodules and/or cancer continues into adulthood [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>]. Other cases are related to exposure due to nuclear accidents. As examples, follow-up of residents &lt;18 years of age living in Belarus at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear accident (April 1986) showed a nearly fourfold increase in risk of having neoplastic thyroid nodules and the risk increased with the dose of radiation exposure and with younger age at exposure [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The pathogenesis of radiation-induced thyroid cancer is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7059.html" rel="external">"Radiation-induced thyroid disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Genetic predisposition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thyroid cancer is included in several familial cancer syndromes and a nonsyndromic form. Children with a thyroid nodule and a family history of one of these disorders are at increased risk for malignancy. For children with a family history of these disorders but no thyroid nodule, screening recommendations are discussed in the linked topic reviews.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Syndromic forms</strong> – Several familial cancer predisposition syndromes are associated with thyroid cancer. All children with thyroid cancer should be evaluated for clinical features that would suggest these syndromes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130398" href="/d/graphic/130398.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), and children with such a family history should be evaluated for thyroid cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2Fentry%2F611731&amp;token=87jLzclRwWxNoI%2BQq5Gg7wXqocDMmtJOR127Cv9VWaB1vnB6wTqpNc0%2FngqnEoYP&amp;TOPIC_ID=5835" target="_blank"><i>APC</i></a> (adenomatous polyposis coli)-associated polyposis syndromes, including Gardner syndrome, are characterized by familial adenomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and a predisposition to papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and several other tumors [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The risk of associated thyroid cancer approximates 10 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], but thyroid cancer usually presents in adulthood. In a report of 129 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, 8.5 percent had PTC, all of whom were female and between 18 to 47 years of age [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. In a case series of 37 children with familial adenomatous polyposis who underwent ultrasound screening, thyroid cancer was diagnosed in two female patients (9 percent) between 17 to 19 years of age but not in any male patient [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. <em>APC</em>-associated PTC frequently has a distinct histopathology (cribriform morular variant), and this variant of PTC should prompt evaluation for a germline <em>APC</em> variant.

Scintigraphy should be performed using iodine-123 (123-I) as the tracer. If the nodule is autonomous (hyperfunctioning or "hot"), it is seen as an area of increased uptake, with absent or suppressed uptake in the remainder of the gland. A serum TSH &lt;0.3 mIU/L at the time of scintigraphy generally ensures that uptake is suppressed in the surrounding thyroid tissue and permits optimal evaluation of nodule autonomy [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. In our experience, children with borderline low TSH in whom an autonomous nodule is suspected can be treated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12550" href="/d/drug information/12550.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> (50 to 75 mcg daily) for one to two weeks to suppress TSH further prior to scintigraphy.</p><p>The majority of autonomous nodules are benign, and FNA generally is not required.

Rarely, a hyperfunctioning nodule may harbor papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) or follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>], so FNA should be considered in the presence of atypical features such as solid parenchyma or abnormal lymph nodes on ultrasound or extrathyroidal uptake on scintigraphy.

Simple cysts are almost always benign. In any child with a thyroid nodule, images should also be obtained to assess the morphology of the cervical lymph nodes. Benign nodes are elongated with a fatty hilum, whereas abnormal nodes may be rounded, lack a fatty hilum, or contain calcifications or cystic spaces.

These systems are useful for assessing suspicious sonographic features but may not be directly applicable in the pediatric population, in part because their recommended size criteria for performing FNA in adults (≥1 to 1.5 cm) may not be appropriate in a growing child whose thyroid gland may normally be one-half the size of that of an adult. In particular, one series found that ACR-TIRADS missed or delayed the diagnosis of 22 percent of pediatric thyroid cancers, primarily those that were below the ACR-TIRADS size thresholds for FNA or sonographic follow-up or those that had few suspicious features [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].

For nodules with this cytology, we generally recommend repeating the FNA in three to six months because repeat cytology may be benign in 25 to 30 percent of cases [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] and benign cytology on repeat FNA is associated with a relatively low risk of malignancy (one of nine patients in one study) [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

Moreover, the negative predictive value of molecular testing in children is unknown; therefore, a "benign" or "negative" result from a molecular test should not be relied upon to exclude malignancy in a child and such nodules should be managed based on cytology and clinical factors.

Neck dissection (central and/or lateral) should be performed using a compartment-based approach in any compartment with clinically evident lymph node metastasis. Total thyroidectomy has long been the recommended initial surgical procedure because PTC in children is bilateral in 35 to 45 percent of cases [<a href="#rid58">58,59</a>] and this feature may not be detectable on preoperative imaging [<a href="#rid59">59-61</a>]. In addition, bilateral thyroid resection has been associated with lower rates of disease recurrence compared with unilateral resection in some studies. In an observational study of long-term outcomes for children with PTC, the incidence of disease recurrence was 25 percent among children who underwent bilateral lobar resection compared with 65 percent for those who underwent unilateral lobectomy [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. Similarly, in another retrospective study of 235 pediatric patients with PTC who were treated at a single center between 1973 and 2002, patients who underwent total or near-total thyroidectomy (n = 172) had fewer local recurrences compared with those who underwent more limited surgical treatment (n = 63; 0.6 versus 17 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].

Administration of iodine-containing contrast for CT must be considered carefully since it will delay potential radioactive iodine therapy. If abnormal lymph nodes are identified in a location that is amenable to surgery, surgical excision may be a reasonable treatment option.

It also improves the sensitivity of post-treatment surveillance with Tg. In a retrospective study of 235 pediatric patients with PTC who were treated at a single center between 1973 and 2002, patients treated with radioactive iodine (n = 174) had fewer recurrences compared with those who did not receive radioactive iodine (n = 61; 0.6 versus 18 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. After adjusting for other variables, radioactive iodine therapy remained a strong independent predictor of recurrence, with more than tenfold increased risk among patients who were not treated with radioactive iodine (odds ratio 11, 95% CI 1.3-95). The efficacy of radioactive iodine is also supported by indirect evidence from studies in adult patients with intermediate- and high-risk PTC. These data are discussed separately.

In intermediate- or high-risk patients who maintain an excellent response for five years after initial treatment, the initial TSH target range may be relaxed to 0.5 to 2 mIU/L.</p><p>Residual or recurrent disease is suggested by elevations in Tg. In a patient who has undergone thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine therapy, a nonstimulated serum Tg concentration ≥1 ng/mL or a TSH-stimulated Tg concentration ≥10 ng/mL likely reflects persistent or recurrent disease. Nonstimulated Tg ≥0.2 ng/mL or TSH-stimulated Tg ≥1 ng/mL is indeterminate for persistent disease. Suspicious ultrasonographic findings may also reveal persistent or recurrent disease. Patients with these findings should undergo studies to identify the location and extent of the residual or recurrent disease. Helpful studies include ultrasound examinations, 123-I radioisotope scans, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Treatment options include surgical excision of disease in localized lymph nodes or radioactive iodine treatment. Clinical judgment is required since some children may have evidence of "low-burden" persistent or recurrent disease yet do well with monitoring alone.</p><p>The presence of Tg antibodies (TgAb) may complicate the interpretation of serum Tg levels. In one study, 41 percent of children with thyroid cancer had positive TgAb, which disappeared in nearly one-half of the cohort within one to two years [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. There is some evidence that the TgAb level can be used as a surrogate estimate of serum Tg (eg, a falling TgAb level is reassuring, whereas a rising level may correlate with disease recurrence) [<a href="#rid81">81</a>].

For minimally invasive FTC, lobectomy usually is curative. If a widely invasive FTC is diagnosed, patients then undergo completion thyroidectomy to facilitate radioactive iodine scintigraphy and treatment. If FTC metastasizes, it is more likely by a hematogenous than lymphatic route. Thus, postoperative staging typically includes a 123-I whole-body scan. Metastases occur most commonly to the lung.
