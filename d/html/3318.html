Knowledge of this anatomy is essential in the prevention of urinary tract injury during gynecologic surgery. The primary approach to prevention is careful surgical dissection and knowledge of the position of urinary tract structures within the surgical field.</p><p>The prevention of urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery, primarily hysterectomy, will be reviewed here. The identification and management of urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery and hysterectomy are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3276.html" rel="external">"Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3311.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy: Abdominal (open) route", section on 'Avoiding ureteral injury'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H197820157"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ureteric injuries (recognized and unrecognized) and bladder injuries at benign gynecologic surgery are significant causes of morbidity and mortality.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3352358060"><span class="h2">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The overall rate of urinary tract injury associated with pelvic surgery in women ranges from 0.3 to 4 percent [<a href="#rid1">1-6</a>]. In a study of a large health care database including over 223,000 patients between 2007 and 2011, 81 percent of whom underwent hysterectomy for benign indications, ureteral injury occurred in less than 1 percent of patients (0.78 percent) and was unrecognized in 62 percent of cases [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Bladder injury is approximately three times more common than ureteral injury [<a href="#rid1">1,6,7</a>]. Up to 2.4 percent of patients may require concomitant urologic intervention after hysterectomy-related injury to the urinary tract [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Recognized and unrecognized ureteric injuries at the time of benign hysterectomy are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The incidence is so low that a particular surgeon may experience no or only a few cases of urinary tract injury in their career. However, because of the morbidity, mortality, and costs, prevention of injury is ideal. If an injury occurs despite every effort to avoid one, intraoperative diagnosis and management, with additional clinician help as needed, is preferred to postoperative recognition for minimizing postoperative sequelae and optimizing patient outcomes.

The expected thermal spread from devices ranges from 2 to 22 mm. In a systematic review of 90 studies, electrosurgery was the most common cause of ureteral injury (33 percent), while lysis of adhesions was the most common cause of bladder injury (23 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. There is no standard time course for presentation of thermal injuries.

While there was no significantly increased risk of acute renal failure or death for recognized ureteral injuries compared with no injuries, unrecognized injury was associated with a nearly 24-fold increased risk of acute renal failure and 40 percent increased odds for death [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional adverse outcomes</strong> – Multiple other large health care and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database studies confirm that complex urinary tract injuries after benign hysterectomy result in significantly longer hospital stays, renal insufficiency, renal failure, transfusions, wound complications, readmissions, repeat surgeries, and increased health care costs compared with patients without injuries [<a href="#rid4">4,11,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased risk of vaginal fistula</strong> – When bladder injuries present postoperatively, genitourinary fistulas appear to be the most common presentation (74 of 76 in one series) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

In a retrospective review of patients undergoing hysterectomy, those with two or more prior cesarean births had an eightfold increased risk of incidental cystotomy compared with those without prior cesarean birth (OR 8.55, 95% CI 3.98-18.36) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In multivariate analysis, the risk was highest in patients with four prior cesarean deliveries.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Procedure and route</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urinary tract injury occurs almost exclusively in major gynecologic surgery that involves surgical dissection in proximity to the ureters or bladder. Minor procedures (eg, hysteroscopy) or tubal surgery are rarely associated with this type of complication. Procedure type and route of surgery (ie, vaginal, laparoscopic, robot-assisted, or abdominal) impacts risk of a urinary tract injury. These factors are in turn influenced by the surgical indication, underlying pathology, degree of anatomic distortion, and surgeon experience. Rates of urinary tract injury by route of hysterectomy are reviewed separately.

This setup also facilitates performing cystoscopy more easily, with better visualization of the entire bladder. </p><p></p><p>In our practice, we place all patients in boot type stirrups and use a Bookwalter retractor for all open cases. This keeps our entire team (surgeon, surgical assistants, scrub, and circulating nurses) familiar and efficient with the equipment set-up and optimal use to get the best exposure. We take care to not use deep retractors in thin patients (eg, pressure on psoas muscle and compression injury of femoral nerve below this). We also loosen and retighten the retractors about every one to two hours as an additional measure to try to prevent nerve injury.
