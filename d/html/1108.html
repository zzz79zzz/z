Normal physiologic changes associated with pregnancy, combined with pathophysiologic processes unique to pregnancy, predispose women to develop stroke during pregnancy and the puerperium.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the relationship between pregnancy and cerebrovascular disorders. Other neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4838.html" rel="external">"Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3990576238"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1818294233"><span class="h2">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnant or recently pregnant women develop stroke (incidence 30 per 100,000 pregnancies) more frequently than their nonpregnant counterparts (annual incidence, 10.7 per 100,000 women of reproductive age) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Data from a population-based registry in Finland suggest that the incidence of stroke during pregnancy or puerperium has increased over time; in the study, the incidence rose by more than two-fold from the initial five-year period (1987 to 1991) compared with the last five-year period (2012 to 2016) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2606842771"><span class="h2">Highest risk periods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The third trimester of pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with a marked increase in the relative risk and a small increase in the absolute risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage; the highest risk is during the puerperium [<a href="#rid3">3-8</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of strokes occur in the antepartum period, 40 percent occur proximate to delivery, and 50 percent occur postpartum and after discharge [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Although data are inconsistent, the incidence of stroke during the antenatal period alone, excluding stroke during the puerperium, may be similar to the incidence in nonpregnant women of childbearing age [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The increased relative risk of stroke in the postpartum period was illustrated in a review of female hospital discharges from central Maryland and Washington, DC for the years 1988 and 1991 that determined the magnitude of the effect of pregnancy (including spontaneous and induced abortions) on stroke risk [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. For cerebral infarction, the relative risk was 0.7 during pregnancy (a nonsignificant difference) but increased to 8.7 in the postpartum period (within six weeks of a live birth or stillbirth). For intracerebral hemorrhage, the adjusted relative risk was 2.5 during pregnancy but increased to 28.3 in the postpartum period. For both types of stroke, which occurred with equal frequency, the excess risk during the postpartum period was 8.1 strokes per 100,000 pregnancies.</p><p>Similar findings were reported in a large study from France [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and in an analysis from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of all pregnancy-related discharges in the United States from 2000 to 2001 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Major risk factors and mechanisms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Important physiologic and pathophysiologic alterations are associated with an increased risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes during pregnancy. These include changes in cardiovascular hemodynamics, coagulation factors, and hemoconcentration, accompanied by endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and impaired cerebrovascular tone [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>A number of complications of pregnancy can present as either a stroke or a stroke-like event, including the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preeclampsia/eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) (see <a class="local">'Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome/postpartum cerebral angiopathy (see <a class="local">'RCVS/postpartum angiopathy'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebral venous thrombosis (see <a class="local">'Cerebral venous thrombosis'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypercoagulable state (see <a class="local">'Hypercoagulable state'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Peripartum cardiomyopathy (see <a class="local">'Peripartum cardiomyopathy'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Amniotic fluid embolism (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1591.html" rel="external">"Amniotic fluid embolism"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gestational trophoblastic disease (see <a class="local">'Gestational trophoblastic disease'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>Other risk factors for stroke related to pregnancy include cesarean delivery, gestational hypertension [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and peripartum infection [<a href="#rid3">3,11,12</a>].</p><p>The risk factors for stroke in pregnancy also include the risk factors for nonpregnant patients, such as hypertension, smoking, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, inherited thrombophilia, arterial disease, certain types of heart disease, hyperlipidemia, paradoxical emboli, arterial dissection, substance abuse, age over 35 years, migraine with aura, and being from a Black population [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>].</p><p>Women with essential thrombocythemia (primary thrombocytosis) are also at increased risk for thromboembolic events during pregnancy [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Risk factors and causes of cerebral venous thrombosis and intracranial hemorrhage in pregnancy are reviewed in greater detail below.

The main advantages of CT are widespread access and speed of acquisition. However, MRI is safe during all trimesters of pregnancy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4791.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and lactating patients", section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>). In addition, MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of early infarction, small infarcts, cerebral venous thrombosis, and structural lesions (eg, cavernous malformations) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1085.html" rel="external">"Neuroimaging of acute stroke", section on 'CT or MRI for initial imaging?'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The neuroradiographic abnormalities of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome are often apparent on head CT but are best depicted by MRI using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4835.html" rel="external">"Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome", section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Note that a small subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be missed by both CT and MRI, especially as the time from SAH onset to imaging study increases. Lumbar puncture may be needed to make the diagnosis of SAH in such patients. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1130.html" rel="external">"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Use of contrast agents</strong> – Iodine and gadolinium-based contrast agents are avoided in pregnancy, if possible.

These levels are considered safe, as there is <strong>no</strong> evidence of an increased risk of fetal anomalies, intellectual disability, growth restriction, or pregnancy loss from ionizing radiation at doses less than 5000 milliradians. The abdomen should be shielded from radiation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4791.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and lactating patients", section on 'Fetal risks'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H463164319"><span class="h2">Cardiac studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography should be obtained in patients with embolic infarctions.

Additional studies may be useful in select patients.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong> – Testing for sickle cell disease is warranted if there is suspicion for the diagnosis. Despite newborn screening, some adults with sickle cell disease may be undiagnosed. The diagnosis of sickle cell disease is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7113.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypercoagulable testing</strong> – We obtain a laboratory evaluation for an inherited or acquired thrombophilia for women presenting with a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack during pregnancy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Molecular genetic testing for inherited thrombophilias (antithrombin deficiency, prothrombin G20210A, factor V Leiden, protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency) can be done anytime. For patients who are pregnant or were recently pregnant, nonmolecular laboratory testing (eg, activated protein C resistance ratio, functional assay for protein C, free protein S antigen assay, antithrombin-heparin cofactor assay) ideally should be delayed until three months or more following delivery.

The immediate goal of reperfusion therapy is to restore blood flow to the regions of brain that are ischemic but not yet infarcted. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115775.html" rel="external">"Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intravenous thrombolysis</strong> – Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8478" href="/z/d/drug information/8478.html" rel="external">alteplase</a> is indicated for patients with acute ischemic stroke who meet eligibility criteria outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462" href="/z/d/graphic/71462.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), provided that treatment is initiated within 4.5 hours of clearly defined symptom onset. We agree with the 2019 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines, which state that intravenous alteplase administration may be considered in pregnancy when the anticipated benefits of treating moderate or severe stroke outweigh the anticipated increased risks of uterine bleeding [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Eligible patients should be treated as quickly as possible within the appropriate 3- or 4.5-hour time limit after careful discussion of the potential risks and benefit [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>].

Potential risks include the maternal hemorrhage with thrombolysis, possibly resulting in premature labor, placental abruption, and/or fetal demise [<a href="#rid10">10,26</a>]. Hemorrhage during parturition or cesarean delivery is a particular risk with thrombolytic therapy if the patient goes into labor or operative delivery is required [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Based on its molecular weight, alteplase is not expected to cross the placenta; it is unknown if alteplase is present in breast milk. There are no data regarding teratogenicity in humans, but no such risk was found in animal studies [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanical thrombectomy</strong> – Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for selected patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by an intracranial large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation who can be treated within 24 hours of the time last known to be well.

This was illustrated in a review of 441 women with a history of ischemic stroke (373 with arterial ischemic stroke and 68 with cerebral venous thrombosis); during a mean follow-up of five years, there were 13 recurrent arterial ischemic strokes and no recurrences of cerebral venous thrombosis [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. The overall risk of recurrence was 1 percent at one year and 2.3 percent at five years. The risk of recurrence during pregnancy or the puerperium was 1.8 percent (not significantly different from outside pregnancy), but the relative risk of recurrence was significantly higher during the postpartum period (risk ratio 9.7, 95% CI 1.2-78.9).

(See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – All patients with suspected acute stroke require an urgent evaluation. An imaging study of the brain is an essential component of the evaluation. A head computed tomography (CT) scan is both informative and readily available.
