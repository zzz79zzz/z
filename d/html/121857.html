The overall prevalence of clinically evident DVT after acute stroke is 1 to 10 percent [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>]. The prevalence of asymptomatic DVT is even higher. In the largest observational report, which evaluated 5632 immobile patients with acute stroke using duplex ultrasound, DVT was detected within 10 days of enrollment in 11 percent, and within 30 days in 15 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. DVT development may occur as early as the second day after stroke onset and has a peak incidence between two to seven days [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Patients with hemiparesis are predisposed to DVT development, and the degree of paresis confers a graded risk of DVT [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In a report that included 542 patients with DVT and a weak leg, the DVT was ipsilateral to the weak leg in 73 percent, contralateral in 11 percent, and bilateral in 16 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, the presence of a DVT on the nonparetic side suggests the presence of DVT on the paretic side [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. Additional important risk factors for DVT include advanced age, high stroke severity, and immobility [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3649299990"><span class="h2">Pulmonary embolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary embolism, often unassociated with clinically recognized DVT, accounts for 13 to 25 percent of early deaths after stroke and is the most common cause of death at its peak occurrence approximately two to four weeks after stroke onset [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The incidence of pulmonary embolism in the first few months after stroke ranges from 1 to 3 percent [<a href="#rid4">4,10-12</a>]. The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H441186277"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO VTE PREVENTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4036129144"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is indicated for all patients with acute stroke and restricted mobility. The approach to VTE prevention differs according to the type of stroke.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2366627109"><span class="h2">Approach in acute ischemic stroke</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Based upon the evidence presented below, we suggest VTE prophylaxis with thigh-length intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), starting at admission, for patients within 72 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset who have restricted mobility. (See <a class="local">'Intermittent pneumatic compression'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to IPC, we suggest pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis for select patients within 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset who have restricted mobility. Exceptions include patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke who are being treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and patients receiving full-dose heparin or oral anticoagulation for another indication. Options for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis include subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9407" href="/z/d/drug information/9407.html" rel="external">enoxaparin</a> 40 mg daily, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9319" href="/z/d/drug information/9319.html" rel="external">dalteparin</a> 5000 units once daily, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10009" href="/z/d/drug information/10009.html" rel="external">tinzaparin</a> 4500 units once daily, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10060" href="/z/d/drug information/10060.html" rel="external">nadroparin</a> 3800 units once daily if weight ≤70 kg, or 5700 units once daily if &gt;70 kg), or subcutaneous low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> (5000 units two to three times daily). This recommendation applies only to patients for whom the assessed benefit of anticoagulation is thought to outweigh the risk of bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Low-dose heparin anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach to VTE prevention is modified according to individual circumstances; common situations include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>After intravenous thrombolysis</strong> – For patients who <strong>are treated</strong> with intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke, IPC should be started on admission, while anticoagulation should be delayed until 24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16134.html" rel="external">"Intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke: Therapeutic use", section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No intravenous thrombolysis</strong> – For patients who are <strong>not treated</strong> with intravenous thrombolysis, IPC should be started on admission, and low-dose heparin (LMW or unfractionated) can be added for patients who are not being treated with DAPT for minor stroke.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>On dual antiplatelet therapy</strong> – For patients with a TIA or minor stroke (ie, a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score ≤3) who are receiving short-term DAPT with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>, it is reasonable to use IPC alone and avoid anticoagulation for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis. The indications for DAPT in acute ischemic stroke are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1082.html" rel="external">"Early antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack", section on 'Efficacy of DAPT'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Already on anticoagulation</strong> – For patients who are receiving oral anticoagulant therapy at the time of acute ischemic stroke, IPC is started on admission. Low-dose heparin (LMW or unfractionated) can be used for VTE prophylaxis (after 24 hours following intravenous thrombolysis) during the interval when full-dose oral anticoagulation is stopped, which is often done to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic infarct during the acute phase stroke. There is no need for concomitant low-dose heparin for VTE prophylaxis if oral anticoagulation is continued, and no need for VTE prophylaxis once oral anticoagulation is restarted and has achieved a therapeutic level. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1082.html" rel="external">"Early antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack", section on 'Limited role of early anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindication to anticoagulation</strong> – For patients with a contraindication to any anticoagulation (eg, gastrointestinal or other major systemic bleeding, or symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic infarction), IPC is used alone for VTE prophylaxis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H123282269"><span class="h2">Approach in intracerebral hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IPC is the mainstay for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and should be started on admission [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Intermittent pneumatic compression'</a> below.)</p><p>Once intracranial bleeding has stopped, some experts add low-dose LMW or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> after one to four days from ICH onset for patients with lack of mobility [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The risk of hematoma expansion may be increased in certain settings (eg, contrast extravasation ["spot sign"] on initial CT angiography, poor control of hypertension, large hematoma volume), which may weigh against the use of anticoagulation. (See <a class="local">'Low-dose heparin anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2980480972"><span class="h2">Approach in subarachnoid hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and decreased mobility, IPC is started on admission and prior to aneurysm treatment. Heparin (LMW or unfractionated) can be added once the aneurysm is secured for patients who continue to have restricted mobility. (See <a class="local">'Intermittent pneumatic compression'</a> below and <a class="local">'Low-dose heparin anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2595197257"><span class="h2">Duration of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most cases, we continue VTE prophylaxis for acute stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) for the duration of the acute and rehabilitation hospital stay, or until the patient becomes fully ambulatory [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Once patients become fully ambulatory, mechanical and pharmacologic interventions of VTE prevention are generally stopped. However, the definition of ambulatory is subjective; patients who have prolonged periods of immobility in between ambulatory periods should probably continue VTE prophylaxis.</p><p>The optimal duration of VTE prophylaxis is uncertain, as the clinical trials have generally employed prophylaxis for two weeks, and longer periods of treatment are not well studied in patients with stroke. A subgroup analysis of one randomized trial suggested that longer-term prophylaxis (eg, up to six weeks) with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9407" href="/z/d/drug information/9407.html" rel="external">enoxaparin</a> reduced the risk of VTE and increased the risk of major bleeding [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H522832113"><span class="h1">INTERVENTIONS FOR VTE PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Effective options for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute stroke and limited mobility include intermittent pneumatic compression devices and low-dose anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin. For patients with acute stroke capable of walking, early and frequent ambulation may be encouraged in addition to mechanical and pharmacologic interventions, although there is no direct evidence that this approach is effective for preventing VTE.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3076915049"><span class="h2">Intermittent pneumatic compression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest VTE prophylaxis with thigh-length intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), starting at admission, for most patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. (See <a class="local">'Approach to VTE prevention'</a> above.)</p><p>IPC is effective for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention in immobilized patients with acute stroke and has few clinically important side effects. Supporting evidence comes from the open-label multicenter CLOTS 3 trial, which randomly assigned over 2800 immobile patients within the first three days of admission for acute stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) to treatment with thigh-length IPC or no IPC [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Treatment was continued for at least 30 days or until the patient regained mobility, was discharged from the hospital, or could not tolerate continuation; the median duration was 9 days. At 30 days, there was a significant reduction in the rate of DVT in the femoral or popliteal veins (ie, proximal DVT) for the IPC compared with the no IPC group (8.5 versus 12.1 percent, absolute risk reduction 3.6 percent, 95% CI 1.4-5.8; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.84). In addition, the IPC group had significantly lower rates of symptomatic DVT (proximal or calf veins) and any DVT (symptomatic or asymptomatic, proximal or calf). In the subgroup of 322 patients with hemorrhagic stroke, IPC was associated with reduced risk of proximal DVT at 30 days (6.7 versus 17 percent; OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.75). No major adverse events were associated with IPC treatment, but the IPC group had a significantly higher rate of skin breaks (3.1 versus 1.4 percent). Approximately one-third of patients in both groups received either anticoagulant prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation.</p><p>The effectiveness of IPC for VTE prevention in patients on anticoagulation is not firmly established. The 2019 PREVENT trial included 2003 critically ill patients, 80 percent of whom were medical intensive care unit patients, and found that the addition of IPC for at least 18 hours a day to unfractionated or LMW heparin did not reduce the rate of ultrasound-detected deep venous thrombosis (3.9 versus 4.2 percent) or symptomatic pulmonary embolism (0.8 versus 1.0 percent) or death from any cause (26 percent each) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. By contrast, a 2016 meta-analysis found moderate-quality evidence that combining IPC and pharmacologic prophylaxis decreased the incidence of VTE in hospitalized patients when compared with IPC alone or pharmacologic prophylaxis alone [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In addition, a 2013 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating hospitalized patients found that IPC plus pharmacologic prophylaxis provided an additive benefit for DVT prevention compared with IPC alone (relative risk reduction 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.91) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>The 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, which were published prior to the CLOTS 3 trial, had found only indirect evidence from other populations, mainly postoperative patients, showing that IPC was associated with reduction in DVT of approximately 50 percent compared with no treatment [<a href="#rid16">16,22</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Administration</strong> – There are several types of intermittent pneumatic compression devices (eg, multichamber versus monochamber, pressure applied sequentially or uniformly, whole leg versus calf only). It is not known what type is optimal for VTE prevention in stroke patients. The CLOTS 3 trial cited above used a multichamber device that applied sequential pressure to the entire leg [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Less than total compliance by patients and caregivers can limit the effectiveness of IPC, so strict adherence should be encouraged for patients with limited mobility.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> – IPC is contraindicated in those with overt evidence of leg ischemia caused by peripheral vascular disease, and in those with leg ulcerations, dermatitis, severe leg edema, or confirmed DVT. It should not be started in patients who have already been at bed rest or immobilized without VTE prophylaxis for more than 72 hours since stroke onset, since IPC may cause a newly formed clot to dislodge.
