In asymptomatic patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) on computed tomography (CT) scans is a well-validated measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. Indeed, the presence of CAC should prompt consideration of aggressive risk factor modification for primary prevention of ASCVD events (including myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, and death from coronary heart disease [CHD]).</p><p>The indications for and approach to obtaining a CAC score, along with the diagnostic and prognostic implications of CAC scoring, will be reviewed here. </p><p>The use of multidetector CT and other modalities for noninvasive coronary angiography are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5308.html" rel="external">"Cardiac imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance in the adult"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2940316301"><span class="h1">WHAT IS CAC?</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1851978274"><span class="h2">Pathophysiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CAC occurs concomitant with the progression of atherosclerotic plaque and is thought to result from smooth muscle cell apoptosis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. CAC begins as microscopic calcifications (0.5 to 15 micrometers), and these can grow into larger calcium sheet-like deposits (ie, &gt;3 mm). Most CAC occurs in the intimal layer of the coronary artery, although in some cases it occurs in the medial layer of the blood vessel. Medial vessel calcification is more commonly seen in renal disease, hyperparathyroidism, and other noncoronary conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7222.html" rel="external">"Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>The earliest form of CAC appears as intimal thickening under microscopic imaging, whereas the calcification at later stages is usually clustered deep within the lipid core of a plaque near the internal elastic lamina of the coronary artery. The center of an atherosclerotic plaque does not always contain calcific deposits. The pattern and extent of calcification does not have a linear correlation with the size of an atherosclerotic plaque or its necrotic core. As such, the presence and extent of CAC can predict the presence of coronary artery stenoses, but in general it is a better marker of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis than it is of disease severity. </p><p>Younger patients tend to have more noncalcified plaque than older patients [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H830715493"><span class="h2">CAC quantification</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Agatston method </strong>– On breath-hold electrocardiogram (ECG) gated CT scans done for the purpose of CAC quantification, CAC is most commonly quantified using the Agatston method. Typically, a 2.5 to 3.0 mm slice thickness CT dataset is used to calculate the Agatston score. The area of calcified atherosclerosis (defined as an area with at least 1 mm<sup>2</sup> with a CT density &gt;130 Hounsfield units [HU] [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]) is multiplied by a density weighting factor. Then, CAC is summed for the entire coronary artery tree. Other methods of quantifying CAC that do not account for lesion density, such as volume or mass scores, may have higher reproducibility, but are less validated for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and rarely used clinically.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most studies evaluating the predictive value of CAC have used absolute values of the Agatston score, which sums the area and density of the CAC. Anatomic features such as number of vessels involved and presence of proximal coronary artery disease add to the Agatston score in predicting major coronary heart disease (CHD) events [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. These measures may enable refinement of models using CAC to stratify patients for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A number of studies have used the following definitions to relate the CAC score to coronary plaque burden: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>0 Agatston units – No identifiable disease</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>1 to 99 Agatston units – Mild disease</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>100 to 399 Agatston units – Moderate disease</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>≥400 Agatston units – Severe disease</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incidental CAC</strong> – Incidental CAC can be found on non-gated chest CT scans that are obtained for other reasons (ie, lung cancer screening). We describe incidental CAC in a semi-quantitative manner in order to fully inform providers and patients of ASCVD risk and to guide preventive strategies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Our approach is consistent with the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) and Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR); they recommend that the presence, severity, and extent of CAC be reported in all non-contrast chest studies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Correlation with Agatston score – There is high correlation between ECG-gated and non-gated Agatston scoring. Non-gated scans are not typically reconstructed at 2.5 to 3.0 mm slices and may be acquired at variable kVp, making formal Agatston scoring impractical. However, several methods of assessing CAC severity using ordinal scores have been shown to correlate to Agatston scoring and have prognostic importance. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Scoring incidental CAC – There is not adequate data upon which to base a recommendation on what type of scoring method to use for assessment of CAC on non-gated chest CT. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Possible methods are summarized below:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>An Agatston score may be calculated on non-gated CT scans using software. Moderate to high correlations between Agatston scores in gated and non-gated scans in the same people have been shown. We prefer to use this method for incidental CAC scoring.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A visual estimation requires the least effort and equipment but has not been well studied (ie, subjective assignment of none, mild, moderate, or severe CAC would correlate with Agatston scores of 0, 1 to 99, 100 to 399, and &gt;400 as described above).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Ordinal scoring is semi-quantitative and uses a simple integer score. For example, one such scoring system assigns absent, mild, moderate, or severe CAC scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 to each coronary artery studied (corresponding to CAC of 0, 1 to 99,100 to 333, and &gt;400, respectively). In this system, mild CAC may be assigned if the CAC is present in less than one-third of the coronary arteries assessed. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H524681870"><span class="h2">CAC percentiles and calculators</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following the results of CAC scoring, providers may compare a patient's CAC score to patients of similar age, sex, and ethnicity using the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mesa-nhlbi.org%2FCalcium%2Finput.aspx&amp;token=5yLNPmHjkOhvnhOBCCm6DGbsKzYJEzQHgscvVx6yIwxHxym4vsSFVW6x42WbLOfhWb8rfHWyVrITdElX7CAcpg%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5297" target="_blank">Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) calculator</a>. This calculator can be used in people 45 to 84 years of age who do not have diabetes or known CVD. Using the percentiles and other information from the MESA calculator can help guide treatment decisions; this information may also help providers convey risk to their patients regarding the amount of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis compared with their peers. This information may also motivate patients to make important therapeutic lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and willingness to take preventive therapies (statins, antihypertensive agents, etc) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The MESA calculator was derived from a study of 6110 participants from the MESA who did not have diabetes or CVD and who underwent CAC scans and Agatston scoring [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. These participants were between 45 and 84 years of age, and identified themselves as White, African American, Hispanic American, or Chinese American. The current tool is thus applicable only for these four race/ethnicity categories and within this age range.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cac-tools.com%2F&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLHNdBTnFnVpMNBPNgNsdcXjhaSc18sY%2FW%2FwP6Gh%2FAw4R&amp;TOPIC_ID=5297" target="_blank">online calculator</a> is available for CAC comparisons in younger patients, ages 30 to 45 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This calculator was derived from pooled data on 19,725 patients from three cohorts (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults [CARDIA], the CAC consortium, and the Walter Reed Cohort). The majority of patients were either Black or White, and thus the calculator allows for calculation of age- and race-specific percentiles of CAC for these two groups of patients. </p><p></p><p>The absolute CAC score is the primary driver of short-term risk. For example, a younger patient with a CAC of 40 is at low short-term risk but high lifetime CVD risk if this score places them in the category of &gt;75<sup>th</sup> percentile for their age and sex; a patient with CAC &gt;400 is at high CVD risk regardless of the time horizon.</p><p>The prevalence of CAC in specific race/ethnic groups and in the context of other social determinants of health are described in more detail below. (See <a class="local">'Race-ethnicity'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2150854792"><span class="h2">Accuracy for detecting coronary artery disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In both males and females, CAC detected by CT is highly sensitive for the presence of ≥50 percent angiographic stenosis, but only moderately specific, especially in individuals over 60 years of age [<a href="#rid10">10-15</a>]. In a review of 16 studies, the sensitivity and specificity of CAC for angiographic stenosis (≥50 percent diameter stenosis) detection were 91 and 49 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Both sensitivity and specificity for the presence of ≥50 percent angiographic stenosis vary with the amount of CAC; as CAC increases, sensitivity falls but specificity increases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2718464903"><span class="h1">IMAGING CAC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Advantages of CAC imaging compared with invasive coronary angiography or coronary CT angiography (CCTA) include minimal requirements for patient preparation, no requirement for iodinated intravenous contrast, and relatively low effective radiation doses.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient preparation – CAC scoring may be performed without any patient preparation. Unlike for invasive coronary angiography or CCTA, patients do not need an intravenous catheter, intra-arterial catheter, beta blockers, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a>, or other medications, nor does CAC scoring require iodinated contrast or fasting. Patients should ideally be able follow instructions asking them to hold their breath for typically three to five seconds and to lie still during scan acquisition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Imaging acquisition – The CAC scan is a rapidly acquired, prospective, ECG-triggered, non-contrast CT image of the heart. Initially validated using electron beam CT, contemporary CAC scoring is now performed using multidetector CT scanning systems. Overall, the image acquisition for a CAC scan differs from that of a chest CT done for other indications (eg, lung cancer screening). (See <a class="local">'Incidental CAC'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiation dose – CAC scans should be performed in accordance with contemporary professional society guidelines. The acquisition of the CAC scan should have an effective radiation dose of no more than 1 mSv; this dose is comparable to that of screening mammography (approximately 0.8 mSv) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. CAC scans can be accurately performed using contemporary dual-source CT scanners using prospective high-pitch helical acquisition at an even lower radiation dose (&lt;0.4 mSv) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], and CAC scoring using iterative reconstruction techniques may allow for even further dose reductions. Performing CAC using 100 kVp rather than 120 kVp also results in significant dose reduction, but requires modification of the Hounsfield units (HU) threshold for CAC detection in order to perform accurate Agatston scoring and is therefore not routinely performed [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2621022341"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL UTILITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two primary uses of screening for CAC include prediction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and selection of patients for treatment with aggressive ASCVD risk factor modification (ie, statin therapy). </p><p>These suggested uses of CAC scoring, including any therapy based on the results of the CAC scan, are generally in agreement with those of professional societies [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2737119607"><span class="h2">Prediction of ASCVD risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CAC scores are usually interpreted in conjunction with other ASCVD risk scoring to guide therapeutic decisions. Various risk calculators and methods of risk assessment are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114029.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ASCVD risk scoring</strong> – Categories of ASCVD risk based on risk calculators are a common way of assessing patient risk. One such set of categories is presented below: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low-risk – Less than 5 percent 10-year ASCVD risk</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Borderline elevated risk – 5 to 7.4 percent 10-year ASCVD risk</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate risk – 7.5 to 10 percent 10-year ASCVD risk</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>High-risk – 10 percent or greater 10-year ASCVD risk</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Very high-risk – 20 percent or greater 10-year ASCVD risk</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incremental benefit of CAC </strong>– Studies have shown that CAC is accurate in predicting future ASCVD. A CAC score can also add incremental value when used in addition to validated risk calculators (eg, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA] pooled cohort equation, Framingham Risk Score, Joint British Societies, etc) [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The prognostic implications of CAC have now been demonstrated in the prospective Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In MESA, CAC was measured in 6814 asymptomatic males and females without baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Participants were followed for 3.8 years for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) death and nonfatal coronary events. Compared with patients who have a CAC score of 0, hazard ratios (HR) for a coronary event were 7.7 for those with a CAC between 101 and 300 and 9.7 for those with CAC &gt;300. </p><p></p><p>Among patients in the CAC consortium cohort, a retrospective multicenter study of 66,636 asymptomatic patients without known CVD, 4.3 percent of patients had a CAC score of &gt;1000. These patients had an increase in CVD-related mortality (ie, from myocardial infarction or revascularization) compared with lower CAC scores [CAC scores of 0 (HR 5.0, 95% CI 3.92-6.48); 1 to 399 (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.43-2.18); and 400 to 999 (HR 3.09, 95% CI 2.41-3.97)] [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Patients with CAC &gt;1000 also had increases in all-cause mortality compared with lower CAC scores.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comparison with other ASCVD risk enhancers </strong>– The serum concentration of biomarkers, including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), have predictive value for CVD in a variety of clinical settings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1469.html" rel="external">"Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome", section on 'Elevation in the general population'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1484.html" rel="external">"C-reactive protein in cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, in asymptomatic patients, the absence of CAC (CAC = 0) has been shown to be the strongest "negative risk factor" as compared with normal or negative values of multiple other novel risk markers, to include carotid intima-medial thickness (CIMT), absence of carotid plaque, family history, ankle brachial index, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), albuminuria, family history, and hsCRP. This "power of zero" provides the strongest degree of individual "de-risking" available (ie, when compared with other traditional and other novel biomarkers)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef122812" href="/z/d/graphic/122812.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">CAC is a stronger predictor of cardiac risk than most other serum biomarkers, including hsCRP. In a study of 1286 patients, the log of CAC increased the C-statistic for cardiac events, whereas multiple biomarkers including hsCRP, interleukin-6, myeloperoxidase, BNP, and plasminogen activator-1 did not [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The C-statistic is a statistical measure of how well a predictor(s) can discriminate between an event (eg, cardiac event) or non-event. In the MESA study, CAC was compared with hsCRP, CIMT, ankle brachial index, brachial flow-mediated dilation, and family history of CHD in 1330 individuals without diabetes [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Each of the individual markers improved the C-statistic over Framingham Risk Score, but CAC demonstrated the highest increment. The net reclassification improvement with CAC for incident CHD was far superior to any of the other markers. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3292451374"><span class="h2">Treatment based on risk reclassification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Obtaining a CAC score in specific patient groups can often help us decide in whom we would recommend more aggressive lifestyle or pharmacologic therapy for CVD risk factor modification including statin therapy. </p><p>Many patients who would not be considered high risk may have a high CAC score that would warrant consideration for statin therapy.
