         Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening condition defined by impaired synthesis and release of adrenocortical hormones. It can be caused by a variety of disorders that interfere with the production of adrenocortical hormones, including abrupt withdrawal of glucocorticoid medications or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

         The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency will be discussed in this topic review. Other aspects of adrenal insufficiency are discussed in separate topic reviews:

         <strong>
          Primary adrenal insufficiency
         </strong>
         results from disease that is intrinsic to the adrenal cortex (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in children is classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). (See

         <strong>
          Central adrenal insufficiency
         </strong>
         is characterized by lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation of cortisol production. Central adrenal insufficiency can be caused by either pituitary disease that impairs production of ACTH (secondary adrenal insufficiency) or by interference with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from the hypothalamus (tertiary adrenal insufficiency) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56675" href="/z/d/graphic/56675.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The most common cause is chronic, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Other patients have congenital or acquired hypothalamic or pituitary disease that causes multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies including ACTH deficiency. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5815.html" rel="external">

         The signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency vary depending on what class(es) of hormone are deficient and the severity of the defect(s). The adrenocortical hormones are divided into glucocorticoids (eg, cortisol), mineralocorticoids (eg, aldosterone), and adrenal androgens (eg, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone). In primary adrenal insufficiency, any or all of these hormones may be deficient. Patients with secondary, or central, adrenal insufficiency do not have mineralocorticoid deficiency or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-related hyperpigmentation.

         In general, clinical findings of children with untreated primary adrenal insufficiency are often nonspecific and include fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Additional symptoms depend upon the specific hormones affected (

         The skin hyperpigmentation is most conspicuous in areas exposed to pressure (eg, elbows and knees, palmar creases, axillae) and in mucosal membranes (tongue, palate, gingival borders), and scars. In individuals with darker skin phototypes, the hyperpigmentation may be most apparent in the gingival borders and mucus membranes. The hyperpigmentation is due to increased production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which is triggered by the cortisol deficiency. POMC is a prohormone that is cleaved into equimolar amounts of the biologically active hormones ACTH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and beta-endorphin. The elevated MSH results in increased melanin synthesis, causing hyperpigmentation.

Clinical findings of adrenal androgen deficiency in postpubertal individuals can be subtle and include decreased or absent axillary and pubic hair and decreased libido in females. Clinical findings are unusual in pubertal and adult males because most of their androgen production occurs in the testes. Prepubertal children with adrenal androgen deficiency are asymptomatic.

          Clinical presentation and features

         – Many patients with adrenal crisis due to primary adrenal insufficiency have features of both glucocorticoid deficiency and mineralocorticoid deficiency. The features of glucocorticoid deficiency may include vomiting, fever, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia. The features of mineralocorticoid deficiency may include headache, dizziness, electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia), and hypotension [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         Young infants with CAH (typically due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency) may be identified by newborn screen and/or atypical genital appearance (46,XX females) or may first present with adrenal crisis, which typically develops within the first two weeks of life. An adrenal crisis in this setting is rare in areas where newborn screening for CAH is routinely performed. Uncommon causes of adrenal crisis in neonates include adrenal hypoplasia congenita and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. Early diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency before the onset of circulatory collapse is imperative. (See

         ). However, cortisol may not rise, because chronic lack of ACTH stimulation impairs the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol in response to acute ACTH administration. Patients with recent-onset central adrenal insufficiency (duration four to six weeks) may have sufficient adrenal sensitivity to respond to ACTH stimulation as the adrenal cortex is not atrophied. In these patients, a low-dose protocol is more likely to help distinguish between primary and central adrenal insufficiency [

         In clinical practice, it is not usually necessary to determine whether ACTH deficiency is due to a secondary (pituitary defect) versus tertiary (hypothalamic defect) cause. The clinical presentation as well as the treatment would be the same. However, if the clinician wishes to distinguish patients with tertiary adrenal insufficiency (eg, due to a hypothalamic injury), a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test could be used. In patients with tertiary adrenal insufficiency, plasma ACTH levels will rise in response to CRH. In those with secondary adrenal insufficiency (or in the rare circumstance of a defective CRH receptor), there will be no CRH-stimulated rise in ACTH secretion.

          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Adrenal insufficiency is suspected on the basis of clinical symptoms, which may include fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Additional symptoms can be categorized based upon the specific hormones affected (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66355" href="/z/d/graphic/66355.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency often have signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency, including hypotension, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities, and may present in adrenal crisis (

          Classification
         </strong>
         – Primary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disease of the adrenal cortex. Central adrenal insufficiency is caused by impaired production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland or of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Initial laboratory testing
         </strong>
         – A provisional diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency can be made if laboratory testing reveals inappropriately low cortisol secretion when tested in the morning (ie, 6 to 8 AM) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51607" href="/z/d/graphic/51607.html" rel="external">

         above.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Other static tests (unstimulated levels) may be included in the initial evaluation depending on the patient's clinical features (

          Electrolytes, glucose, and renin
         </strong>
         – For all patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency to identify electrolyte abnormalities caused by mineralocorticoid deficiency (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia) or cortisol deficiency (isolated hyponatremia), which may require urgent management. Plasma renin activity (PRA) or direct renin may be included for selected patients with high risk for mineralocorticoid deficiency.

          Stimulation testing
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually confirmed by serum cortisol responses to a rapid intravenous
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13183" href="/z/d/drug information/13183.html" rel="external">
          ACTH stimulation test

          table 6
         </a>
         ). Cortisol results during this test are abnormal for either primary adrenal insufficiency or chronic central adrenal insufficiency (wherein sustained lack of endogenous ACTH stimulation leads to adrenal atrophy). Results of this test may be normal in recent-onset central adrenal insufficiency. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test'

         </a>
         is not always necessary. If basal serum cortisol is low and the patient has strong clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hyperpigmentation, electrolyte abnormalities, or other pituitary hormone deficiencies), the clinician may decide that this combination of findings is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and initiate treatment.

          Further evaluation

         Children with primary adrenal insufficiency should have a full evaluation for CAH. This is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in children, with the severe forms usually presenting during infancy. If CAH is excluded, patients should be evaluated for other forms of primary adrenal insufficiency (

         Children with central adrenal insufficiency have deficient ACTH secretion from the pituitary due to pituitary dysfunction or deficient release of CRH from the hypothalamus (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56675" href="/z/d/graphic/56675.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The most common cause is chronic, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, which causes reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, with risk of adrenal crisis during the suppression phase. In clinical situations unrelated to prior use of glucocorticoids, other pituitary hormones also should be measured.
