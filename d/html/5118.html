         Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) refers to the delivery of positive pressure ventilation through a noninvasive interface (eg, nasal mask or pillows, face mask, or mouthpiece), rather than an invasive interface (ie, endotracheal tube, tracheostomy).
        </p>
        <p>
         Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is commonly used to assist ventilation in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency due to a variety of chronic neuromuscular and chest wall diseases. The practical aspects of initiating NIV in this population are discussed here. Selecting suitable patients for chronic NIV use, follow-up of chronic NIV during the adaptation phase, and aspects of NIV use in

         In most patients, we initiate NIV for nocturnal use (ie, during sleep). However, the initial trial is often begun during daytime hours while the patient is awake so they can be acclimated to the procedure before using it during sleep, unless the patient is an inpatient or in a sleep laboratory. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial trial'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with severe chronic respiratory failure, there may be an additional need for several hours of NIV while awake with breaks for select periods (eg, meals).
        </p>
        <p>
         In those with progressive disease, the need for NIV may slowly advance to a point where NIV is required for almost 24 hours a day. NIV at this level may be maintained for a significant length of time, at which point we typically discuss and make a decision regarding the inevitable need for tracheostomy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4389.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for nocturnal NIV is that patients with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall disorders have worsening alveolar hypoventilation during sleep compared with ventilation when awake. In addition, nocturnal NIV has the potential to prevent further deterioration of sleep quality in this population.

         In the US, the initial process of applying NIV usually takes two to four hours and occurs mostly in an outpatient setting. Choosing among these settings depends upon several factors including the severity of respiratory failure, preferences of the patient, and presence of any suspected or actual coexisting sleep disorder. Regardless of the setting, appropriate use of NIV is dependent upon expert staff who ensure the provision of a comfortable snug-fitting interface with minimal air leaks, appropriate initial settings, and follow-up that comprises several visits, frequent check-ins, and adjustment in settings (if needed).

         <strong>
          Outpatient setting
         </strong>
         – For most patients with chronic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular or chest wall diseases, we initiate NIV as an outpatient. Patients best suited to outpatient initiation include those with mild or early respiratory failure who are not anxious and in whom no sleep disorder is suspected.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         An initial trial can occur in the home, clinician's office, or medical supply company office. Most often this will occur in the patient's home with the assistance of therapists from a durable medical equipment company. Education and a brief trial of NIV is commenced during daytime hours under the direct supervision of skilled personnel (eg, respiratory therapist or nurse).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Once an interface and ventilator is selected and the patient is comfortable, an NIV trial with titration of settings is then begun. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Interfaces (masks)'
         </a>
         below and

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         There is a paucity of data that supports this approach. One study reported a similar improvement in gas exchange and quality of life among patients who had NIV initiated at home using telemonitoring compared with patients who had NIV initiated as an inpatient [

          Sleep laboratory
         </strong>
         – For patients with suspected or known concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other sleep disorder, we suggest in-laboratory polysomnography with NIV titration. The rationale for this approach is that polysomnography is required to ensure elimination of apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory-related arousals from the underlying sleep disorder, and also to augment ventilation associated with chronic hypoventilation from the underlying neuromuscular or chest wall disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, if in-laboratory polysomnography is not readily available, the laboratory lacks the appropriate experience of adjusting ventilation for neuromuscular disease, or the patient has a preference for avoiding the sleep laboratory (eg, some patients with advanced neuromuscular disease have difficulty adapting to an in-laboratory environment), then initiation of NIV should not be delayed while waiting for a sleep study. In such cases, NIV may be initiated in the outpatient or inpatient setting, and subsequently be evaluated in the laboratory or home setting if problems are encountered (eg, poor efficacy, residual sleepiness). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5123.html" rel="external">
          "Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Adaptation and follow-up after initiation"

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Our approach varies from that of the 2011 NIV Titration Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). The AASM recommended that in most patients with neuromuscular disorders (even if an underlying sleep disorder is not suspected), the initial titration of NIV should occur in a sleep laboratory, rather than at home, to optimize pressure settings in addition to comfort [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Their rationale is that titration in the laboratory with careful analysis of effort and flow, and adjustment of trigger sensitivity, rise time and inspiratory time may help mitigate patient-ventilator asynchrony that may occur when patients with neuromuscular disease are initially placed on NIV [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, this recommendation is based on expert opinion, and evidence is lacking to demonstrate the superiority of this approach over home initiation.

          In-hospital setting

         – In Europe, in-hospital initiation has been preferred by many clinicians. In the US, this is uncommonly practiced. One small, randomized trial found no advantage of initiation during a few days of hospitalization compared with initiation at home with frequent visits from trained nurses [

         In most patients with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall disorders in whom NIV is chosen, a nasal mask is the preferred interface  (

         Templates are available to assist with mask sizing. In general, we select the smallest mask that fits comfortably.
        </p>
        <p>
         An important aspect of mask fitting is setting the strap tension. Generally, we select the least amount of strap tension that does not allow excessive leak but protects the skin from irritation and breakdown.

         If nasal masks are not suitable or cannot be tolerated, several alternatives are available. (See

         – We prefer standard nasal masks for chronic NIV applications since they can effectively deliver nocturnal NIV and are generally well tolerated by patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Standard nasal masks are clear plastic dome-shaped devices that fit over the entire nose and have a soft rubber or silicone cuff to maintain an air seal  (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most patients successfully adapt to standard nasal masks. However, some masks are uncomfortable because of poor fit (eg, nasal or facial deformity) or excessive mask pressure on the nose. In such patients, alternatives include "gel masks" that use a soft gel or foam in the sealing gasket or "minimasks" that seal underneath the nose and cover only the entrance of the nares .

         – Nasal pillows (or prongs) or a nose cradle may be preferred by patients who are unable to tolerate a nasal mask due to nasal discomfort (or ulceration). Nasal pillows consist of soft rubber cones that are inserted directly into the nostrils, thereby exerting no pressure on the nasal bridge  (

         One issue that can occur with nasal masks is air leak via the mouth (eg, patients with mouth weakness). If this is noted during the initial trial, a chin strap may be placed to facilitate mouth closure and improve the delivery of positive pressure to the lungs. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients with significant air leak in whom a chin strap is not helpful, we consider an oronasal mask (ie, a mask that covers the nose and mouth  (

        </p>
        <p>
         However, in patients with neuromuscular weakness, certain safety issues are a concern. Upper extremity strength needs to be sufficient to allow the patient to access quick-release straps for rapid removal of the mask in the event of an emergency (eg, vomiting, secretion buildup) or power failure. We also ensure that an oronasal mask with an anti-asphyxia valve is used. An anti-asphyxia valve opens in the event of blower device failure; without an anti-asphyxia valve, rebreathing could occur and asphyxiate the patient.

         Full-face masks that cover the entire face with the upper border going across the forehead and the lower border between the chin and lower lip spare the bridge of the nose and allow mouth breathing. They may also allow vocalization to a greater degree than standard oronasal masks. Thus, in some patients who have problems with nasal comfort or obtaining a good seal with the standard oronasal mask, or for patients who have a strong preference for vocalization, we consider a full-face mask. Similar to oronasal masks, concerns regarding cautious use in patients with upper extremity weakness also applies. (See

Mounting the ventilator on a wheelchair and suspending the mouthpiece on a gooseneck stand allow the patient to remain mobile and simultaneously have access to positive pressure as needed (also called "sip and puff" ventilation). A mouthpiece can also be strapped onto the face for use during sleep, although many patients switch to a nasal (or oronasal) mask at night.

         In patients with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular or chest wall disorders, we suggest positive pressure ventilation delivered through a pressure-limited device. Volume-limited ventilators are an alternative for those who do not tolerate pressure-limited devices or need an assured volume.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who cannot tolerate pressure- or volume-limited ventilation or who need more prolonged or intermittent support during the day, we consider using a hybrid ventilator. Hybrid devices have sophisticated alarms and monitoring and can deliver volume-assured pressure support (VAPS) that automatically modulates pressure to achieve a target tidal volume.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, regardless of whether a volume- or pressure-limited device is used, the initial priority should be to achieve patient comfort and acceptance rather than any particular level of improvement in gas exchange.

          Pressure-limited ventilators

         – Portable pressure-limited ventilators that deliver bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel PAP) are the ventilator device of choice  (

         Pressure-limited ventilators deliver both a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP); the difference between the two determines the delivered tidal volume  (

         One advantage of pressure-limited ventilation is its ability to maintain inspiratory airflow on a breath-by-breath basis to compensate for air leaks, which are common with NIV, particularly when it is administered via a nasal mask [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Pressure-limited ventilators have sensitive flow triggers for cycling between inspiratory and expiratory pressures, matching patient breathing efforts closely. However, the presence of large air leaks may also impair the ability of pressure-limited ventilators to sense patient inspiratory or expiratory flows, leading to asynchrony.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most devices also provide a spontaneous (S)-, timed (T)-, or spontaneous/timed (S/T) backup mode; the S/T mode is most commonly used. The use of a backup respiratory rate that approximates the patient's spontaneous breathing rate assures ventilator inspiratory triggering during large leaks or potential periods of apnea.

         Hybrid ventilators are capable of delivering several modes of ventilation (eg, volume- or pressure-limited ventilation) as well as mouthpiece ventilation and have both invasive and noninvasive applications.

         Hybrid ventilators may also be required when patients need a more complex form of ventilation such as average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) and intelligent volume-assured pressure support (iVAPS); these modes of ventilation target an average minute volume determined by setting a target tidal volume and backup rate. Both modes have algorithms that adjust inspiratory pressure to assure the target volumes are met.

         The goal of initial settings is to provide a modest amount of ventilatory support while allowing the patient to become acclimated to NIV  (

         ). Typically, patients are started on bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel PAP) ventilation delivered via a standard nasal mask. Volume-cycled ventilation and average or intelligent volume-assured pressure support ventilation (AVAPS, iVAPS) are less commonly used initial modes and are more likely to be used if bilevel PAP ventilation fails or is poorly tolerated. To improve acceptance, we prefer to initiate NIV using low initial pressures, which can then be subsequently increased to a desired level once the patient becomes acclimated. The settings and titration modules provided in the algorithm are suggested as an initial guide only  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef138401" href="/z/d/graphic/138401.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2

         ); for comfort, some patients may even need lower than usual initial settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         For all modes, a backup respiratory rate is usually set at two to four breaths per minute below the patient's spontaneous rate. This is particularly important in patients with neuromuscular disease who have weak respiratory muscles and therefore may not be capable of spontaneously triggering the ventilator reliably while asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also find it helpful to set a high trigger sensitivity, which makes it easier for the patient to transition from exhalation to inhalation.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the same reason, we generally set a longer than usual inspiratory time for patients with neuromuscular disorders (ie, 33 to 50 percent of the total respiratory cycle time). In contrast, patients with concomitant airway obstruction usually prefer a shorter inspiratory time and longer time for exhalation. Patients with chest wall disorders may not need adjustment in the trigger sensitivity or inspiratory time.

         When the patient is being monitored in the sleep laboratory (ie, with polysomnography and capnography), additional targets include elimination of any apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory-related arousals from OSA, as well as augmentation of ventilation associated with chronic hypoventilation from the underlying neuromuscular or chest wall disorder.

         For patients who are anxious about NIV, we sometimes initiate the trial during the daytime using a diversion, such as watching television, which can facilitate adaptation.

        <p>
         If the patient is very claustrophobic, it may be helpful for them to feel the pressure with their hand first, then hold the mask over their face for a few minutes rather than using the straps right away. This allows the patient to remove and reapply the mask quickly during those first few minutes and gives the patient a sense of control. Once the patient can tolerate the mask, the straps should be attached for effective ventilation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although typically avoided, in rare instances when patients have a high level of anxiety, a low dose of benzodiazepine may help ease the initial transition to NIV.

         – Oximetry is generally measured during the initial trial. There is a lack of consensus on whether and how to monitor carbon dioxide levels during initiation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Baseline measurements, oxygenation, and gas exchange monitoring'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Initial settings and titration
         </strong>
         – Initial settings vary depending on the mode selected. Titration during the trial increases the degree of support to target improved symptoms and a tidal volume that ranges between 6 and 10 mL/kg ideal body weight/minute. The appropriate preparatory steps, initial stings, and titration for the selected mode are provided in the algorithms  (

         ). In all modes, expiratory positive airway pressure or positive end-expiratory pressure is not typically titrated (unless the patient has OSA), and a backup respiratory rate is usually set at two to four breaths per minute below the patient's spontaneous rate. (See

         <strong>
          Trial adjustments
         </strong>
         – With the patient at 30 degrees or more, the trial begins, and ventilator settings titrated  (

         ). The patient is reassured, and the mask and straps are readjusted as needed to reduce leakage of air from the mask, using the least strap tension necessary. (See
         <a class="local">

          Trial duration and follow-up
         </strong>
         – The trial may last one to two hours (outpatient setting) or overnight (inpatient or sleep laboratory setting). In most patients, we prescribe NIV at the tolerated settings discovered during the trial. We instruct patients to use NIV each night for at least a few hours, or as long as possible. Further adjustments are subsequently made during follow-up visits a few weeks later, as indicated by symptoms, gas exchange, and patient tolerance. (See
