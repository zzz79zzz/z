         Any patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) presents a major management challenge, and this challenge is further complicated when the patient is carrying a fetus at or beyond the limit of viability. For example, delaying delivery to transfuse a pregnant patient with DIC who is bleeding heavily may not be in the best interest of a fetus with a category III heart rate tracing, whereas performing an emergency cesarean delivery on a pregnant patient with DIC may not be in the pregnant patient's best interest. Even in the setting of fetal demise, labor and vaginal delivery of a pregnant patient with DIC carries the potential for catastrophic hemorrhage.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the management and prognosis of pregnant women with DIC. Clinical findings, etiology, and diagnosis of DIC in pregnancy are discussed separately (see

         In the obstetric setting, most patients with DIC are intrapartum and have severe uterine bleeding. Resuscitation aims to treat the condition that caused the DIC, achieve euvolemia, normalize tissue oxygen delivery, and resolve acidosis and coagulopathy. This is achieved by appropriate fluid therapy and transfusion (using a 1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets), warming the patient, and providing appropriate airway and ventilatory management. Multiple techniques for controlling uterine bleeding are available after the fetus has been delivered. (See

         Many interventions are implemented concurrently. They are appropriate in acutely ill patients with suspected DIC even if the diagnostic evaluation is in progress and the diagnosis is uncertain.

         If a fetal demise is identified or the fetus is clearly under the limit of viability, then the entire focus of management becomes the optimal care of the mother. The limit of viability is defined as the stage of maturity that would ensure a reasonable chance of survival without severe deficits.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Determining the limit of viability is desirable so that futile interventions that are costly and painful can be avoided in a fetus/neonate who does not have the possibility of a reasonably favorable outcome. However, deciding on a threshold of viability is challenging since it remains uncertain which extremely preterm infants, particularly those born at 22, 23, and 24 weeks of gestation, have a reasonable chance of survival without severe deficits. The short- and long-term morbidity from preterm birth, the intensity of care required, and the likelihood of survival at various gestational ages are discussed in detail separately. (See

         If the fetus is alive and at a gestational age above the limit of viability, the fetal heart rate typically shows a category III tracing in pregnancies complicated by severe bleeding since maternal hemodynamic instability results in poor placental perfusion and suboptimal fetal oxygenation. In these cases, the maternal and fetal risks and benefits of immediate delivery for fetal indications versus delaying delivery to initiate maternal resuscitation need to be weighed. Involving the neonatology and anesthesia services can help when discussing these issues with the patient or the patient's legal guardian. (See

         Although not highly accurate, blood loss can be estimated by collection in a volumetric container and by weighing pads/towels used to soak up the blood. In cases of severe abruption with concealed hemorrhage, the magnitude of blood loss can be estimated and monitored using a combination of parameters, including hourly assessment of changes in fundal height, clot volume on ultrasound examination, urine output, and serial hemoglobin/hematocrit assessment.

         The cornerstone of therapy is to identify the underlying disorder leading to DIC and initiate appropriate treatment for that disorder. Obstetric etiologies of DIC  (

          table 1A

         ) usually are readily identified by history, physical examination, and ultrasound findings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Delivery is a key component in management of all obstetric etiologies of DIC because termination of pregnancy leads to resolution of the obstetric disorder that initiated DIC.

         Crystalloid (with or without colloid) and/or blood products, when available, are infused to support blood pressure (systolic ≥90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure ≥65 mmHg) and achieve/maintain urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg/hour.

         The best approach to fluid resuscitation remains controversial. The trauma literature favors the use of blood and blood products as the initial volume expander in cases of massive hemorrhage. The rationale is that large volumes of crystalloid will dilute the red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and coagulation factors that are present and thereby potentially worsen bleeding. Thus, in a situation of severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) with ongoing bleeding, transfusion of type O, D-negative uncrossmatched blood (switching to type-specific or crossmatched RBCs when available) along with platelets and cryoprecipitate (or lyophilized fibrinogen and/or fresh whole blood, if available) may be preferable to infusing a large volume of crystalloid.

         Blood is rapidly administered to actively bleeding patients. In massive hemorrhage, rapid transfusion of blood components and avoiding associated hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia are essential for ensuring adequate tissue perfusion and for preventing the combination of acidosis, coagulopathy, hypothermia, and electrolyte abnormalities, which is often lethal ("lethal quad").

         In most instances, preparation of fully typed and crossmatched RBCs requires at least 20 minutes. For patients who are actively bleeding, the clinician can begin transfusion immediately using type O, D-negative RBCs, if necessary, and then switch to type-specific or crossmatched RBCs when available. Initially, type AB FFP (or thawed plasma, either D-positive or negative) can be used when plasma transfusion is necessary prior to obtaining type-specific FFP. (See

Many massive transfusion protocols recommend transfusion of FFP, platelets, and RBCs in a ratio of 1:1:1.

         The optimal hemoglobin concentration for pregnant patients who are about to deliver has not been determined and likely depends on patient-specific factors, such as the expected blood loss during delivery, baseline hemoglobin level and rate of fall, and presence of medical comorbidities. The overall risk of mortality increases as the hemoglobin concentration decreases; some experts have suggested a minimum hemoglobin of 7 g/dL for pregnant patients receiving massive transfusion with an overall treatment target of 8 to 10 g/dL in patients with ongoing severe PPH [
         <a href="#rid4">

         Our goal in massive obstetric hemorrhage is to maintain the hemoglobin ≥7 and as high as 8 to 10 g/dL because pregnant patients with DIC have ongoing blood loss that will further increase at the time of delivery and because equilibration generally results in a fall in hemoglobin. This is likely to require transfusions matched to the estimated blood loss rather than waiting for the results of laboratory testing, depending on the turnaround time for the hemoglobin or hematocrit. A lower hemoglobin level (7 versus 8 to 10 g/dL) is acceptable after the patient has delivered, is no longer actively bleeding, or is hemodynamically stable. In cases of severe, ongoing hemorrhage, we use a 1:1:1 ratio (units of FFP to platelets to RBCs). This is based on data from other populations showing improved outcomes compared with other ratios. Lower ratios of FFP to RBCs may result in a greater risk of dilutional coagulopathy. (See

         Six units of red blood cells at 4°C will reduce the body temperature of a 70 kg adult by 1°C. This heat loss can be additive with the evaporative heat loss associated with an open abdomen or other body cavity which, by itself, can lead to a 1°C decrease in core temperature in 40 minutes. Thus, 10 units of cold blood products and an hour of surgery can lead to a 3°C drop in core temperature and hypothermic coagulopathy.

         Hypothermia results in sympathetic stimulation with increased myocardial oxygen consumption, particularly if shivering occurs, which may lead to myocardial ischemia. Other adverse consequences of hypothermia include coagulopathy, decreased platelet function, and increased mortality.

The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic Trial found that TXA (1 gram in 10 minutes IV followed by a second dose of 1 gram in 10 minutes if bleeding is still ongoing after 30 minutes) reduced death due to bleeding by 20 to 30 percent in patients with PPH (especially when administered within three hours of delivery) and was not associated with an increase in adverse effects [

This may include a gynecologic oncologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, obstetrician, and/or general surgeon. If interventional radiology services are available, they should be notified of the possible need for their services as well. The obstetric, anesthesia, and surgical team members should communicate with each other regarding the volume and rate of blood loss, site(s) of bleeding, quality of clot formation, and response to techniques used for control of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).

          Operating room

         – It is important to keep the operating room warm (80°F) during resuscitation. Surgery in patients with a very high potential for massive blood loss is best performed in a hybrid delivery-operating room to provide the ability to embolize and/or place an aortic balloon. A bleeding patient should only be removed from the operating room to an interventional radiology suite if the patient has been adequately resuscitated, is hemodynamically stable, and has blood and blood products available to maintain perfusion and reverse coagulopathy.

         If uterine bleeding remains brisk and maternal hemodynamic status is deteriorating despite initial surgical interventions and blood component replacement, we use a Penrose drain or urinary catheter as a uterine tourniquet. The drain is placed as low as possible around the lower uterine segment without incorporating the urinary bladder, and then the two ends are pulled in opposite directions and as tightly as possible around the corpus to mechanically occlude the vascular supply. A second or third tourniquet can also be applied, as needed. The tourniquet can be held in place with a clamp  (

         ). This procedure markedly reduces blood loss and allows time for the anesthesia team members to catch up with transfusion requirements. When the patient is hemodynamically stable, the tourniquet is removed, and the surgical procedure is completed. The abdomen is closed in a standard fashion. (See

          Pelvic packing

         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. To abort the cycle, the pelvic bleeding needs to be acutely controlled. In some cases, this can be achieved by tightly packing the area using a pelvic pressure pack or lap sponges [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. If the abdomen is packed as a temporizing effort, the abdominal wound, including the fascia, is left open and a pressure dressing is applied. We have also used towel clips to temporarily reapproximate the skin/subcutaneous tissue.

         It is prudent to place a large bore drain to alert the team to any ongoing massive bleeding, as the abdomen may need to be opened and repacked or some other intervention attempted. The recently pregnant abdomen will never provide sufficient pressure to tamponade a major bleed; thus, this should not be regarded as an option.

         It is unwise to move an acutely unstable patient with temporarily controlled bleeding, or uncontrolled bleeding, from the operating room. If possible, the patient should be kept on the operating room table under anesthesia with all resources ready for immediate reopening of the abdomen. It is better to monitor these fragile, unstable patients in the operating room for several hours rather than transfer them back to an intensive care unit where surgical facilities are not available.

         Hysterectomy is a last resort in patients who wish to preserve childbearing capacity, but should not be delayed when less aggressive interventions fail to quickly control hemorrhage. Delaying hysterectomy allows ongoing loss of blood and coagulation factors and increases the frequency of serious complications (eg, kidney failure, acute lung injury, neurologic dysfunction). (See

         <strong>
          Transfusion
         </strong>
         – Hemodynamically stable patients with DIC are at risk of developing severe bleeding due to depletion of coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia. When an early stage of DIC is suspected, a falling fibrinogen level that is still within the normal range should prompt replacement therapy, typically with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9082" href="/z/d/drug information/9082.html" rel="external">
          fibrinogen concentrate
         </a>
         or cryoprecipitate (if available). Although fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be used, it will require a significantly larger volume (&gt;10 times) to replace fibrinogen compared with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. If the fibrinogen level is &lt;200 mg/dL in a situation where bleeding is not active but anticipated (eg, patients with preeclampsia with severe features or a concealed abruption), the author believes that it is essential to administer fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate to increase the fibrinogen level to over 300 mg/dL, given the higher normal baseline fibrinogen level in pregnancy and the desire to maintain the fibrinogen level well-above the danger zone in these patients mg/dL. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Other blood products should be readily available and used as appropriate for the amount of bleeding. Transfusion is usually appropriate in obstetric patients with DIC since they have, or are at high risk for, massive bleeding and they are likely to experience obstetric events associated with bleeding (eg, cesarean birth, episiotomy, genital tract lacerations). Thresholds for transfusion of blood products are listed above. (See

          Timing of delivery
         </strong>
         – Decision-making regarding timing of delivery in hemodynamically stable patients depends on the expected course of the underlying cause of DIC. For example, prompt delivery via induction of labor or cesarean birth is indicated in acute obstetric DIC  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130588" href="/z/d/graphic/130588.html" rel="external">
          table 1A
         </a>
         ) since termination of pregnancy leads to resolution of the obstetric disorder that initiated DIC. In contrast, chronic DIC (eg, in a twin pregnancy with single twin demise) usually does not require prompt delivery and is managed medically, as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131147.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In very rare cases where the mother with acute nonobstetric DIC is responding appropriately to resuscitation with blood products and the fetal heart rate (FHR) tracing is normal, there is no compelling need for immediate delivery via induction of labor or cesarean birth. Instead, the clinical focus is on reversing or eliminating the cause of DIC and reducing the risk of maternal bleeding and thrombosis.

         If the fetus is dead or has a very poor prognosis (eg, gestational age less than 22 to 23 weeks of gestation, lethal or life-threatening congenital abnormality, preterminal FHR tracing), the goal is minimizing maternal morbidity and mortality. In many, but not all, cases, this means avoiding cesarean birth because of the risk of uncontrollable hemorrhage from surgical incisions and lacerations.

         Delivery is initiated, as removal of the products of conception removes the trigger for DIC in many obstetric cases and causes the myometrium to contract (uterine involution), thus addressing both the major source and the major site of hemorrhage. In the second trimester, dilation and extraction is a good option for rapid uterine evacuation if the clinician is skilled in this procedure. Otherwise, and in the third trimester, labor should be induced if it has not already ensued or should be augmented if it is not progressing rapidly.

         In some cases of attempted induction of labor in patients with DIC complicating abruption, uterotonic agents appear to be less effective at initiating and sustaining labor. If the fetus is dead and in a cephalic presentation, the cervix is sufficiently dilated to allow access to the fetal head, and an experienced operator is available, then attachment of Willett forceps (or a specifically designed cephalic perforator such as the Groote Schuur Hospital perforator) enables traction on the decompressed fetal head and vaginal delivery [

         Given that PPH, blood transfusion, and prolonged surgery are all risk factors for venous thromboembolism, in a stable patient with normal coagulation tests and who is not at high risk for reoperation, adding prophylactic heparin (or equivalent) 24 hours after surgery is also a reasonable option.

          Mortality

         – Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a major contributor to maternal mortality. Rates of DIC-related maternal mortality vary widely and recent figures are not available [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,31,32
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, approximately 20 to 25 percent of maternal deaths are related to hemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, all of which can be associated with coagulopathy [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. As in nonpregnant individuals, mortality depends on the ability to reverse the underlying cause as rapidly as possible.

          Morbidity
         </strong>
         – DIC in a pregnant patient often leads to severe obstetric hemorrhage and its sequelae (see

          "Overview of postpartum hemorrhage", section on 'Outcome'
         </a>
         ). However, most patients with DIC due to pregnancy-related complications rapidly improve with delivery and treatment of coagulopathy. In cases complicated by severe liver dysfunction, however, resolution of DIC can take as long as four to five days postpartum because the liver is the source of most coagulation factors and the site for clearance of D-dimer [

         <strong>
          Blood products
         </strong>
         – For patients with heavy bleeding, we order a minimum of 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 dose of platelets (either 4 to 6 whole blood-derived platelet units or 1 platelet apheresis), and 10 bags of cryoprecipitate (two pools of 5 units), and begin transfusion of blood products prior to receiving initial laboratory results. We transfuse pRBCs, FFP, and platelets in a ratio of 1:1:1 in cases of severe hemorrhage. This ratio is expected to reduce the risk of dilutional coagulopathy. (See

          Fibrinogen

         – In a pregnant patient with active bleeding and a fibrinogen level &lt;300 mg/dL, fibrinogen is replaced to achieve a level ≥300 mg/dL, which is considered the minimum level necessary to safely ensure adequate coagulation in pregnancy. (See

         The concentration of fibrinogen in a unit of FFP is low, and successful reversal of a very low fibrinogen level is unlikely unless a concentrated form of replacement fibrinogen is used.

         – Cesarean birth is required if the mother is hemodynamically unstable despite vigorous transfusion. It is desirable, but not always possible, to correct or improve the clotting abnormality prior to cesarean birth. If a cesarean birth must be performed urgently, pRBCs, FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate should be available in the operating room and administered as indicated. (See

          Key elements
         </strong>
         – Hemodynamically stable patients with DIC are at risk of severe bleeding due to depletion of coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia. Although it is not possible to reliably predict which patients will have massive bleeding, blood products should be readily available and used as is appropriate for the amount of bleeding. Transfusion is usually appropriate in obstetric patients since they have, or are at high risk for, massive bleeding and they are likely to require an invasive procedure. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hemodynamically stable patients'
         </a>
         above.)

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If the fibrinogen level is &lt;200 mg/dL in a situation where bleeding is not active but anticipated (eg, patients with preeclampsia with severe features or a concealed abruption), it is essential to administer

         or cryoprecipitate to increase the fibrinogen level to over 300 mg/dL. (See

          Route of birth
         </strong>
         – If the fetus is viable, cesarean birth is performed for standard indications, otherwise a vaginal birth is preferable. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Viable fetus with nonreassuring fetal status or contraindication to vaginal birth'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Viable fetus with reassuring fetal status and no contraindication to vaginal birth'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If the fetus is nonviable, the goal is minimizing maternal morbidity and mortality. In the second trimester, we suggest dilation and extraction (D&amp;E), rather than induction, if clinicians skilled in performing D&amp;E are available (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Otherwise, and in most third-trimester cases, we favor supporting the mother with crystalloid (with or without colloid) and blood products and inducing or augmenting labor. In experienced hands, a destructive procedure that reduces the diameter of the fetal head may expedite vaginal delivery and avoid need for a hysterotomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonviable fetus'

         <strong>
          Uterine tourniquet
         </strong>
         – For uterine bleeding after placental extraction that persists despite standard measures, we suggest using a Penrose drain or urinary catheter as a uterine tourniquet (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This procedure markedly reduces blood loss and allows time to catch up with transfusion requirements. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Delivery'

         <strong>
          Role of hysterectomy
         </strong>
         – Even though hysterectomy is considered a last resort in patients who wish to preserve childbearing capacity, it should be performed promptly if continued bleeding persists despite other preventive measures. These patients can enter a lethal downward spiral characterized by hypothermia, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of hysterectomy'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Maternal stabilization
         </strong>
         – If hysterectomy is not performed immediately because the patient is too unstable, the bleeding area should be tightly packed and the abdomen temporarily closed to reduce ongoing blood loss to a level where blood products can be transfused at a higher rate than the loss. Once the patient is resuscitated and euvolemic with a stable blood pressure, attempts to complete whatever surgery is needed may continue.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The patient should not be removed from the operating room in an unstable condition and should stay there until such time as the patient is stable, bleeding has stopped, and coagulopathy is reversed. The patient should be continuously monitored while resuscitation continues, blood products are administered as appropriate, and any physiologic derangements are corrected. When the patient is stable, definitive surgical interventions can be performed. (See

          'Techniques to control bleeding at laparotomy'
