This three-month duration distinguishes chronic from acute kidney disease. Additional details on the definitions and staging are presented at length elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16406.html" rel="external">"Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7238.html" rel="external">"Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults"</a>.)</p><p>For patients being evaluated for elevated serum creatinine or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), it is important to distinguish those who have relatively stable CKD from those who have acute or subacute kidney injury, which may be ongoing and reversible. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rise in the serum creatinine level that has developed within hours to days  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83168" href="/z/d/graphic/83168.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Subacute kidney injury (also called acute kidney disease) informally refers to any decline in kidney function that evolves over more than 48 hours but less than three months [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Diagnostic approach to these patients is presented in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7188.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102834.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of acute kidney injury among hospitalized adult patients"</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the presentation and evaluation of patients with newly identified CKD is presented in this topic  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129522" href="/z/d/graphic/129522.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

However, many have no clinical symptoms, and kidney disease is often detected in these patients when an elevated serum creatinine, reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or an abnormal urinalysis is discovered incidentally (when such tests are obtained as part of routine evaluation or for a possibly unrelated disorder). In addition, radiographic findings (eg, small and echogenic kidneys [by ultrasound] suggesting chronic damage, multiple bilateral kidney cysts with enlarged kidneys suggestive of polycystic kidney disease) may be observed on imaging performed for some other reason.</p><p>Depending upon the duration and severity of CKD, patients may also present with symptoms and/or signs of prolonged kidney failure, including weakness and easy fatigability, anorexia, vomiting, pruritus, and, in very advanced stages, with encephalopathy or seizures.</p><p>An abnormally reduced urine output (ie, oliguria or anuria) is seldom observed with CKD alone and always indicates at least some component of acute kidney injury (AKI). Oliguria or anuria may be present among patients with AKI superimposed on CKD, such as may be observed in a patient with chronic obstruction who develops acute urinary retention. Similarly, anuria as a result of severe or prolonged shock, bilateral urinary tract obstruction, pregnancy-related cortical necrosis, or bilateral renal arterial occlusion (eg, due to a dissecting aortic aneurysm) may occur in patients with underlying CKD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102834.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of acute kidney injury among hospitalized adult patients", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The most common laboratory findings in patients with CKD include increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Urine studies may show proteinuria (or albuminuria) and/or abnormal red or white blood cells on urine microscopy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2359.html" rel="external">"Assessment of kidney function"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7196.html" rel="external">"Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Other common laboratory abnormalities that may be part of the clinical picture include anemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH).</p><p>The degree to which these abnormalities are present depends upon the severity of CKD. Hyperphosphatemia is uncommon among patients with CKD with eGFR &gt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. PTH, on the other hand, may be mildly elevated even with a mild reduction of eGFR (ie, 50 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1969.html" rel="external">"Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)", section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3069213241"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These and other possible etiologies are discussed in detail below. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The causes of kidney injury are classically divided into three categories: prerenal; intrinsic renal; or postrenal. However, any cause of kidney injury, if sufficiently severe or long-standing, may lead to persistently abnormal kidney function and therefore CKD. As an example, a patient with severe heart failure may have recurrent or prolonged acute kidney injury (AKI) due to reduced effective arterial blood volume (ie, prerenal disease). Over time, even if cardiac function and kidney perfusion pressure improve, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may never fully recover to normal. </p><p>In addition, whatever the initial cause of kidney disease, a sustained decrease in GFR can produce adaptive hyperfiltration within the remaining functional nephrons, which may lead to further injury and worsening of CKD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7172.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults", section on 'Natural history of kidney disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease", section on 'Intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1806427962"><span class="h1">INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND TRIAGE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial assessment for all patients who present with suspected chronic kidney disease (CKD) starts with triage of those who may need urgent dialysis based upon symptoms or life-threatening laboratory abnormalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129522" href="/z/d/graphic/129522.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). In other patients, the time course of their kidney disease should be established to determine the role and timing of consultation with a nephrologist.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H135455839"><span class="h2">Identifying patients needing urgent dialysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with CKD may have absolute or relative indications for dialysis at the time that their kidney disease is discovered. Those who have refractory pulmonary edema, life-threatening hyperkalemia or metabolic acidosis, encephalopathy, or a pericardial rub should be referred to the emergency department for rapid evaluation and possible initiation of dialysis. These indications are discussed at length elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1866.html" rel="external">"Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Even among patients not requiring urgent dialysis, most may benefit from early referral to a nephrologist. (See <a class="local">'Indications for a nephrology evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2185545901"><span class="h2">Determine the duration of kidney disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients who do not require dialysis, we start by evaluating the duration of the kidney disease. Typically, this entails assessing serial serum creatinine values (and associated estimated glomerular filtration rates [eGFRs]) over time. If urine tests or radiologic studies of the kidney are abnormal at the time of CKD discovery, temporal changes in these data should also be assessed.  </p><p>Establishing the duration and trajectory of the disease accurately is fundamentally important and requires that older data be obtained for comparison. In some cases, it may be necessary to acquire this information from the patient's prior caregivers or from other health centers.</p><p>Along with the trend of any clinical symptoms, the trajectory of the laboratory abnormalities will determine if and when additional evaluation or nephrology referral is necessary. Recognition of a rapidly progressive process versus stable disease permits early intervention to curtail an active process and to preserve residual kidney function.  </p><p>The importance of determining the trajectory of kidney disease is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consider a patient with no significant medical history and a current serum creatinine of 4 mg/dL (354 micromol/L) who had a creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL (53 micromol/L) one month earlier. This patient has acute or subacute kidney injury. This patient needs urgent evaluation and management to stop further injury and to optimize kidney recovery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7188.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>By contrast, consider a different patient who has an identical current serum creatinine of 4 mg/dL (354 micromol/L). However, this patient has had long-standing, poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus and had a serum creatinine of 3.5 mg/dL (309 micromol/L) two years earlier, as well as chronically increased albuminuria. This patient likely has slowly progressive CKD. Although this patient will also benefit from nephrology referral, these laboratory data alone, without concurrent significant symptoms, would not justify urgent or extensive evaluation, since the process is less likely reversible. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications for a nephrology evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The determination of disease duration can also help distinguish between CKD and subacute kidney injury (also called acute kidney disease), although this distinction can be arbitrary. The clinical course of gradually progressive CKD is commonly punctuated by transient, small "spikes" in serum creatinine, which often improve to resume a prior long-term trajectory  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef128932" href="/z/d/graphic/128932.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). However, the pace of eGFR decline may increase and, if the rate of decline becomes rapid, such patients may be more appropriately evaluated as subacute kidney injury rather than CKD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7188.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>When prior serum creatinine values, urine studies, or radiographic images are unavailable, certain findings from the history and physical examination, or subsequent laboratory or radiographic evaluation, may suggest the duration of disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>New symptoms or signs, such as sudden onset of anasarca and discolored urine, suggest a more acute process.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Oliguria (urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hour [often &lt;500 to 600 mL/day]) or anuria in a patient not on maintenance dialysis indicates an acute process. Prolonged oliguria or anuria do not occur in slowly progressive CKD (even if advanced).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A daily increase in serum creatinine after the initial discovery of an abnormal value indicates at least some component of an ongoing acute process. Conversely, a serum creatinine that does not change, or changes minimally, over weeks to months suggests the presence of CKD. Distinguishing CKD progression from subacute kidney injury may be difficult in the setting of a serum creatinine that is worsening gradually  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef128932" href="/z/d/graphic/128932.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The level of CKD, magnitude of eGFR decline, changes in clinical symptoms, and other factors (such as reliability of patient follow-up) should dictate the frequency of laboratory monitoring to clearly establish a trend. Overall, a rate of decrease of eGFR &gt;5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year (or &gt;25 percent decline in eGFR) should prompt early retesting to establish a clear trajectory and to rule out ongoing subacute injury. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Imaging that reveals small, echogenic kidneys provides definitive evidence of chronicity of disease. However, the presence of normal-sized kidneys does <strong>not</strong> exclude chronicity, since some causes of CKD (such as diabetic kidney disease) are associated with preserved kidney size. Kidney parenchymal echogenicity (normally kidneys are less echogenic than the liver), if increased, suggests nonspecific diffuse kidney dysfunction [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7194.html" rel="external">"Radiologic assessment of kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiologic evidence of renal osteodystrophy such as subperiosteal bone resorption or loss of bone density at the distal third of the clavicles suggests CKD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1969.html" rel="external">"Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)"</a>.) </p><p></p><p>Other findings are less helpful. As an example, anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency is a common (although not absolute) finding in CKD, but acute or subacute kidney injury can also be associated with anemia (from either hemolysis or bleeding). Although hyperphosphatemia commonly affects patients with CKD, it may also be seen in AKI or subacute kidney injury and, therefore, does not help distinguish acute from chronic disease. The absence of anemia or hyperphosphatemia does not exclude the presence of CKD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H80035490"><span class="h1">SUBSEQUENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the initial assessment and triage is complete, we perform an evaluation to identify the cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and identify individuals who may benefit from a nephrology consultation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129522" href="/z/d/graphic/129522.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H448435658"><span class="h2">Evaluation to identify cause</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We obtain a cause-specific history, perform a targeted physical examination, and, if not done recently, we obtain urine studies and an ultrasound to determine the cause as follows:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H648254081"><span class="h3">Targeted history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We specifically determine if there is a history of any of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Long-standing diabetes and hypertension commonly lead to CKD. The duration of disease (diabetes and/or hypertension) and the degree of control should be determined in such patients. In addition, the presence of diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy should be ascertained because patients with retinopathy have a higher likelihood of having CKD from diabetes and/or hypertension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3824.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertensive nephrosclerosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3103.html" rel="external">"Diabetic kidney disease: Pathogenesis and epidemiology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3872.html" rel="external">"Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Renovascular disease should be suspected among patients who have peripheral arterial disease in other vascular beds or who have multiple vascular risk factors, such as age over 50 years, hyperlipidemia, or cigarette smoking. Renovascular disease can present as CKD. Features that suggest CKD due to renovascular disease include resistant hypertension, recurrent flash pulmonary edema, or a reversible increase in serum creatinine after receiving antihypertensive therapy, particularly angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which improves after withdrawal of the drug.

Typically, this entails assessing serial serum creatinine values (and associated eGFRs) over time. If urine tests or radiologic studies of the kidney are abnormal at the time of CKD discovery, temporal changes in these data should also be assessed. Establishing the duration and trajectory of the disease accurately is fundamentally important and requires that older data be obtained for comparison. In some cases, it may be necessary to acquire this information from the patient's prior caregivers or from other health centers. When prior serum creatinine values, urine studies, or radiographic images are unavailable, certain findings from the history and physical examination, or subsequent laboratory or radiographic evaluation, may suggest the duration of disease. (See <a class="local">'Determine the duration of kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsequent evaluation</strong> – Once the initial assessment and triage is complete, we perform an evaluation to identify the cause of CKD and identify individuals who may benefit from a nephrology consultation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129522" href="/z/d/graphic/129522.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Evaluation to identify cause</strong> – We obtain a cause-specific history, perform a targeted physical examination, and, if not done recently, we obtain urine studies and an ultrasound to determine the cause. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation to identify cause'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for a nephrology evaluation</strong> – Based upon the targeted history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging, further evaluation with additional tests and kidney biopsy may be warranted. Some adults with newly identified CKD should be referred to a nephrologist.
