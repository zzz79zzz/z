It may remain as atrial flutter, it may degenerate into atrial fibrillation, or it may revert to sinus rhythm within hours or days. In patients who present with or who have recurrent episodes associated with a rapid ventricular rate, slowing of the rate may be necessary to either reduce symptoms or prevent tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. </p><p>For the purpose of this topic, rate control means lowering the heart rate, which in the case of atrial flutter is usually difficult to achieve. Thus, for many patients, radiofrequency ablation (and permanent restoration of sinus rhythm) is the preferred long-term approach to patients with atrial flutter. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1065.html" rel="external">"Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm", section on 'RF catheter ablation'</a>.)</p><p>The physiologic and clinical rationales for ventricular rate control in atrial flutter and the modalities used to achieve this goal will be reviewed here. Other issues such as the causes of atrial flutter, the embolic risk associated with this arrhythmia, and the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1048.html" rel="external">"Overview of atrial flutter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1069.html" rel="external">"Restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1066.html" rel="external">"Embolic risk and the role of anticoagulation in atrial flutter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1065.html" rel="external">"Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PHYSIOLOGIC BASIS FOR THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ventricular rate in atrial flutter is principally determined by the rate at which impulses exit the atrioventricular (AV) node. With a regular atrial rate of 300 beats/min, the ventricular rate is usually about 150 beats/min. This ventricular rate is determined by the refractory period of a healthy AV node, such that every other impulse (2:1) traverses the AV node and travels to the ventricles. In the absence of drugs that slow AV nodal conduction, a higher degree of AV block (eg, 3:1 or 4:1) suggests AV nodal disease; in these settings, the ventricular rates would be roughly 100 and 75 beats/min, respectively.</p><p>Even input/output ratios (eg, 2:1 or 4:1 conduction) are more common than odd ratios (eg, 3:1 or 5:1). Odd ratios probably reflect bilevel block in the AV node. Sometimes, variable conduction may occur with alternating or seemingly random patterns of 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, or other conduction patterns, again due to varying levels of block in the AV node. On the other hand, a 1:1 response with typical atrial flutter usually suggests possible hyperthyroidism, catecholamine excess, parasympathetic withdrawal, or the existence of an accessory bypass tract. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/953.html" rel="external">"Anatomy, pathophysiology, and localization of accessory pathways in the preexcitation syndrome"</a>.) </p><p>An important exception can occur in patients taking antiarrhythmic drugs, which can slow the atrial flutter rate so that 1:1 conduction occurs. This occurs most commonly with the class IC drugs, particularly when used in the absence of concomitant AV nodal blocking agents, but can also occur with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9037" href="/d/drug information/9037.html" rel="external">dronedarone</a> or even <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>. Also, 1:1 conduction of "slow" atrial flutter can occur in patients with marked right atrial enlargement.</p><p>The AV node has been called a "slow response" tissue, since its action potential depends on calcium ions flowing through kinetically slow channels  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75699" href="/d/graphic/75699.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The activation and reactivation characteristics of these channels limit the rate of conduction through the AV node. The autonomic nervous system can modify the rate of conduction, which is increased by sympathetic activity and reduced by parasympathetic activity.</p><p>It is useful to consider the electrophysiologic differences between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, since they can impact therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atrial fibrillation is characterized by multiple wandering wavelets, which result in the AV node being bombarded by 400 to 600 impulses per minute. Some impulses traverse the AV node and reach the specialized infranodal conduction system and then the ventricles. However, most of the atrial impulses penetrate the AV node for varying distances and then are extinguished by encountering the refractoriness of an earlier wavefront; this phenomenon of concealed conduction in turn creates a refractory wave that affects succeeding impulses. The lack of shortening of the refractory period with increasing rate (as occurs in the atria) further decreases the likelihood of an impulse traversing the AV node. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1014.html" rel="external">"The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In comparison, typical atrial flutter is a macroreentrant arrhythmia, resulting in approximately 300 impulses/min reaching the AV node. This slower rate produces less refractoriness within the AV node and therefore less concealed conduction than in atrial fibrillation.</p><p></p><p>Based upon these observations, it would be expected that atrial fibrillation would be more sensitive than atrial flutter to drugs that affect AV nodal refractoriness; this prediction has been confirmed clinically. Stated another way, control of the ventricular rate in atrial flutter is more difficult than in atrial fibrillation. (See <a class="local">'Rate control with drugs'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR RATE CONTROL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three principle situations in which rate control should be considered: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immediate rate control to reduce symptoms during a first or subsequent episode in which a patient has not reverted to sinus rhythm (or spontaneously converted to atrial fibrillation); cardioversion should be considered, as it has a high likelihood of success. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1069.html" rel="external">"Restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It should be kept in mind that acute rate control in asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic patients with atrial flutter rarely works in the absence of coincident atrioventricular node disease. In the majority of patients, we focus on restoring sinus rhythm with cardioversion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic therapy to prevent symptoms in patients who are likely to have recurrent atrial flutter and are not scheduled to undergo radiofrequency ablation of the atrial flutter. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1065.html" rel="external">"Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm", section on 'RF catheter ablation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic therapy to prevent tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1062.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy"</a>) in the uncommon patient with chronic atrial flutter who does not undergo radiofrequency ablation of the atrial flutter. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atypical atrial flutter may result after an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. Frequently, these patients may be more symptomatic with faster heart rates than when in atrial fibrillation. It may be difficult to rate control these patients, and antiarrhythmic agents, cardioversion, and/or atrial flutter ablation are frequently necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/949.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation", section on 'Arrhythmic complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The following two characteristics of atrial flutter render the need to decide about the initiation of rate slowing uncommon:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atrial flutter may be an electrically unstable rhythm, meaning that it may degenerate into the less organized atrial fibrillation or revert to sinus rhythm within hours or days. Spontaneous reversion of paroxysmal atrial flutter to a sinus mechanism may occur after predisposing problems are improved, such as decompensated heart failure and the sequelae of cardiac surgery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent atrial flutter is less common than persistent atrial fibrillation and is frequently associated with structural heart disease, atrial enlargement, prior cardiac surgery or atrial fibrillation ablation, or congenital heart disease. In these patients, chronic therapy to control the ventricular response is generally difficult unless there is concomitant atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atrial flutter, particularly the typical cavotricuspid-isthmus-dependent variety, is usually curable with catheter ablation. If patients have both atrial flutter and fibrillation, ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus will not necessarily eliminate recurrent atrial fibrillation. This strategy may still be useful in selected patients in whom rapid rates during atrial flutter are highly symptomatic, but episodes of atrial fibrillation are well tolerated. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13490261"><span class="h1">RATE CONTROL GOALS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although rate control targets have been described for atrial fibrillation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], they are less useful in atrial flutter since, as noted above, atrioventricular block tends to go in steps (eg, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1). For most patients, we believe a ventricular rate at rest of less than 80 beats/min is reasonable for symptomatic patients and less than 110 beats/min may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with normal left ventricular systolic function. Rate control should be assessed both at rest and with exertion. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">RATE CONTROL WITH DRUGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of therapy with drugs that slow atrioventricular (AV) conduction is to improve symptoms and prevent the development of a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. For patients who require immediate rate slowing, and for whom cardioversion (and the restoration of sinus rhythm) is not chosen, we prefer intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9365" href="/d/drug information/9365.html" rel="external">diltiazem</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9420" href="/d/drug information/9420.html" rel="external">esmolol</a> to other options. For patients who will be placed on long-term oral therapy for rate control, we prefer either diltiazem or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10043" href="/d/drug information/10043.html" rel="external">verapamil</a>.</p><p>The rate at which impulses from the atria exit the AV node is the principle determinant of the ventricular rate. (See <a class="local">'Physiologic basis for therapy'</a> above.) Thus, rate control in atrial flutter is achieved principally with drugs that slow conduction through the AV node.</p><p>The pharmacologic agents for controlling the ventricular rate in atrial flutter are based as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blockade of the calcium channel with the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9365" href="/d/drug information/9365.html" rel="external">diltiazem</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10043" href="/d/drug information/10043.html" rel="external">verapamil</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decrease sympathetic tone using beta-blockers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enhancement of parasympathetic tone with vagotonic drugs, most frequently <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, which slows AV nodal conduction and increases AV nodal refractoriness.</p><p></p><p>However, as discussed above, the smaller amount of concealed conduction in the AV node because of the slower atrial rate in atrial flutter means that greater AV nodal refractoriness must be produced. As a result, higher doses of a single drug are required, and combination therapy at conventional doses is frequently needed to minimize toxicity. Difficulties with pharmacologic rate control make patients with atrial flutter excellent candidates for a catheter ablation procedure, which is often curative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1065.html" rel="external">"Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm", section on 'RF catheter ablation'</a>.)</p><p>Nonpharmacologic therapy to convert back to normal sinus rhythm including direct current cardioversion, pace termination, or catheter ablation are reasonable treatments if the patient is having adverse hemodynamic consequences from the arrhythmia, if pharmacologic therapies are unsuccessful or not tolerated, or if the patient has pre-excitation syndrome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9365" href="/d/drug information/9365.html" rel="external">diltiazem</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10043" href="/d/drug information/10043.html" rel="external">verapamil</a> may be useful for acute rate control in non-pre-excited atrial flutter when given intravenously and can produce long-term rate slowing when given orally (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3832.html" rel="external">"Major side effects and safety of calcium channel blockers"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/951.html" rel="external">"Calcium channel blockers in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/951.html" rel="external">"Calcium channel blockers in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias", section on 'Atrial fibrillation and flutter'</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9365" href="/d/drug information/9365.html" rel="external">Diltiazem</a> – Intravenous diltiazem is often the drug of choice for acutely controlling the rapid ventricular response in atrial flutter [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].

Monotherapy with oral diltiazem can be used to treat patients with persistent atrial flutter, as well as patients who have recurrent or persistent atrial fibrillation with episodic atrial flutter.

However, SA nodal function is depressed in patients with the sinus node dysfunction, at least in part due to blockade of calcium channels and an inability of the sinus node to respond to catecholamines. Thus, if the normal reflex mechanism is impaired by therapy with a beta blocker, the addition of a calcium channel blocker can lead to slowing or, rarely, failure of SA nodal function.

Esmolol is preferred to other intravenous beta blockers in this setting due to its rapid onset of action and a greater clinical experience. Esmolol begins to act in one to two minutes, is metabolized by red blood cell esterase, and has a short duration of action of 10 to 20 minutes.

However, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers, singly or in combination, have largely supplanted digoxin for both initial intravenous rate control and chronic oral therapy. </p><p>The use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a> for the treatment of heart failure is discussed separately.

It is not as effective as these two categories of drug, and its use is associated with higher mortality in patients at higher digoxin levels. It may not be appropriate for use in older patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/938.html" rel="external">"Control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have heart failure: Pharmacologic therapy"</a>.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">Digoxin</a> can be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly, although we do not use the intramuscular route because absorption is erratic. Intravenous digoxin begins to act within 15 to 30 minutes, with a peak effect attained in one to five hours. The relatively slow onset of action of digoxin is undesirable in patients with a rapid ventricular response. Since digoxin has a slow onset of action, there is rarely a reason for parenteral administration in patients who can take oral medications. </p><p>A larger dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a> than used in atrial fibrillation is required to control the ventricular rate in atrial flutter; as noted above, the smaller amount of concealed conduction in the AV node because of the slower atrial rate in atrial flutter means that greater AV nodal refractoriness must be produced [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored periodically in patients on persistent therapy. Although the correlation between drug concentration and ventricular rate control is poor, the presence of a low value is useful since it allows a higher dose to be administered. The use of high doses of digoxin is potentially hazardous if electric cardioversion is performed, since this combination increases the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>Junctional escape beats (as detected by similarity of the longest observed recurring R-R intervals on the electrocardiogram [ECG]) are common when <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">digoxin</a> has successfully slowed the ventricular rate. Giving additional digoxin in this setting will increase the degree of AV nodal block and produce periods of regular junctional rhythm. The change from single junctional escapes to periodic junctional rhythm suggests the development of digoxin toxicity. If the pulse is palpated but ECG not reviewed, it may be mistakenly assumed that the patient is in sinus rhythm.</p><p>However, it may be difficult to distinguish on the ECG between digoxin-induced complete heart block during atrial flutter and a slow, regular ventricular rate. In complete heart block, the R-R interval will not be an exact multiple of the atrial cycle length (A-A interval). In addition, the relationship between the QRS complex and flutter wave (ie, the point on the flutter wave where the QRS complex begins) is variable during complete heart block. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Amiodarone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">Amiodarone</a> can be used for rate control, but it should be remembered that intravenous amiodarone can possibly promote reversion to sinus rhythm, albeit infrequently. Since cardioversion is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, amiodarone should generally not be used in patients who are not candidates for conversion to sinus rhythm because of inadequate anticoagulation.
