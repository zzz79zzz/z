It is indicated for females who are certain they have completed childbearing and do not wish to use a reversible contraceptive method or consider vasectomy of their male partner. Permanent contraception procedures vary by timing, surgical route (laparotomy, mini-laparotomy, or laparoscopy), and technique (tubal occlusion, partial or complete salpingectomy).</p><p>This topic is an overview of female permanent contraception. Specific types of permanent contraception, including postpartum permanent contraception and interval permanent contraception, as well as other types of contraception are discussed in detail separately. Hysteroscopic permanent contraception is no longer available for clinical use and is therefore not included in this topic. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3307.html" rel="external">"Female interval permanent contraception: Procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101866.html" rel="external">"Postpartum permanent contraception: Procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5459.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Counseling and selection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, we will use the terms "patients" or "females" when discussing the counseling and treatment for permanent contraception procedures. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals. Terminology that some individuals may find more fitting includes "pregnancy-capable individuals" or "assigned female at birth."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11784843"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1343815641"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Female permanent contraception is the world's most common method of family planning; in 2020, it was used by 22.9 percent of all contraceptive users, for a total of 219 million females [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Reliance on female permanent contraception among contraceptive users is highest in Central and Southern Asia (47 percent; India accounts for 48 percent of the global number of individuals who rely on female permanent contraception) and Latin America and the Caribbean (26 percent). All regions have seen a decline in female permanent contraception between 1995 and 2020, with the overall prevalence of female permanent contraception decreasing from 29 percent to 23 percent of all contraceptive users.</p><p>Female permanent contraception is also a commonly used method of birth control in the United States; between 2017 and 2019, 18 percent of reproductive-age females (or 27.6 percent of contracepting females) used a permanent method [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Overall, rates of permanent contraception in the United States have decreased over the last two decades, probably because of the increased use of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, which are more effective and cheaper than permanent methods [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1140470074"><span class="h2">Demographic factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factors that are associated with increased use of permanent contraception include [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing parity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Currently or previously married.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Public insurance or no insurance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive disabilities; individuals with self-reported cognitive disabilities undergo permanent contraception at higher rates and at younger ages than individuals with physical or other disabilities or with no reported disability [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower levels of education and income [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p></p><p>While rates of permanent contraception were previously higher among Hispanic females and non-Hispanic Black females compared with White females, rates decreased among Hispanics females between 1995 and 2019 and are now more similar among these patient groups [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11784877"><span class="h1">CANDIDATES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H874577446"><span class="h2">Indications and contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The only indication for female permanent contraception is the patient's preference to have a permanent method of contraception for pregnancy prevention. The choice is made by the patient, but the decision requires thorough counseling about alternatives (eg, long-acting reversible contraception, vasectomy), permanent sterility, and the risk of regret. (See <a class="local">'Counseling and informed consent'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no absolute medical conditions that contraindicate female permanent contraception; however, there may be factors that make patients more suitable to a particular route of permanent contraception or other contraceptive options. (See <a class="local">'Assessing surgical risk'</a> below and <a class="local">'Timing and surgical approach'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1311207912"><span class="h2">United States regulatory issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are legal restrictions regarding permanent contraception in some health care settings.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age</strong> – In the United States, federal funding prohibits permanent contraception for females under the age of 21 and those who are deemed to be mentally incompetent (see <a class="local">'Vulnerable populations'</a> below). There is some variation by state, with some individual states funding permanent contraception procedures for females 18 to 21 years old. Clinicians should be aware of their state regulations. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The restrictions against permanent contraception of younger patients generally do not apply to those with private insurance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of consent</strong> – For females in the United States who have federally funded health insurance, the Medicaid consent form must be reviewed, signed, and dated between 30 and 180 days prior to the permanent contraception procedure. Some states may allow this waiting period to be reduced to 72 hours; each provider should be aware of local or institutional policies related to the federal sterilization consent form [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. These requirements can contribute to inequities in permanent contraception fulfillment [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H103521971"><span class="h1">COUNSELING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Counseling patients who are considering permanent contraception includes shared decision making with the patient regarding alternatives to permanent contraception, discussing risks and benefits of the procedure, and establishing patient expectations, particularly those that impact the risk of regret. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20184324"><span class="h2">Counseling and informed consent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The preoperative counseling and informed consent process should include a detailed discussion with the patient of the issues included here; this discussion should be documented in the medical record. There should be no coercion or bias in the offering or choosing of permanent contraception [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Permanence</strong> – Tubal permanent contraception should be considered a permanent procedure, and the patient should be aware that reversal of permanent contraception is often not feasible, is generally expensive, and is not routinely covered by health insurance. Future pregnancy may be possible using in vitro fertilization (IVF), but this is also expensive and not typically covered by insurance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3279.html" rel="external">"Female infertility: Reproductive surgery", section on 'Tubal reanastomosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Regret</strong> – Most patients are satisfied with their decision to undergo a permanent contraception procedure, but some patients experience regret. This is discussed in detail below. (See <a class="local">'Regret after permanent contraception procedures'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – In general, the cumulative 10-year failure rate of female permanent contraception is 1 to 2 percent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], which is comparable to the failure rate of either vasectomy or long-acting reversible contraception (LARC  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54215" href="/z/d/graphic/54215.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) [<a href="#rid10">10-14</a>]. Higher rates (up to 2 to 3 percent within the first year following the procedure) have been reported [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Many patients are unaware of the comparable efficacy between LARC, vasectomy, and female permanent contraception. These alternatives should be discussed with all patients as part of routine contraception counseling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3307.html" rel="external">"Female interval permanent contraception: Procedures", section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risks and benefits of other contraceptive methods</strong> – Presumably, patients who are considering permanent contraception desire a contraceptive method that is highly effective and does not require frequent dosing. Thus, LARC or vasectomy are the most likely alternatives.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Comparison with LARC</strong> – LARC is not permanent and involves a minor office procedure that must be repeated once the device reaches its expiration date in approximately 5 to 10 years, depending on the device type. Additionally, there may be significant noncontraceptive benefits of a progestin-releasing device, such as reduced menstrual flow, decreased dysmenorrhea, and endometrial protection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116579.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Background and device types", section on 'Noncontraceptive benefits'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3266.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Etonogestrel implant", section on 'Noncontraceptive benefits'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Comparison with vasectomy</strong> – If permanent contraception is desired and the patient is in an ongoing sexual relationship with a male partner, the option of vasectomy should be addressed. Vasectomy, which is an outpatient procedure done without anesthesia, has lower morbidity and mortality rates than female permanent contraception via mini-laparotomy or laparoscopy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Vasectomy is also the most cost-effective method of permanent contraception [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Given its safety and efficacy profile [<a href="#rid8">8,18</a>], vasectomy should be the preferred method of permanent contraception for individuals in a heterosexual relationship but is significantly underutilized with only 8.2 percent of females between the ages of 15 to 44 relying on vasectomy for contraception [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Vasectomy requires the male partner's willingness to undergo the operation and assumes that the patient will not have any other male partners. Conflict between spouses regarding the permanent contraception decision was shown to be a strong risk factor for regret and request for reversal of both procedures [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In contrast to female permanent contraception procedures, vasectomy is not effective right away and requires back-up contraception until azoospermia is confirmed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8094.html" rel="external">"Vasectomy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk of ectopic pregnancy</strong> – Female permanent contraception methods and intrauterine devices (IUD) are associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in the rare cases when the method fails. In the United States Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST), a landmark study of outcomes following female permanent contraception procedures, approximately 1 in 3 pregnancies that occurred in the setting of female permanent contraception was ectopic [<a href="#rid9">9,21</a>]. This rate is similar to the rate of ectopic pregnancy in users of the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104541" href="/z/d/drug information/104541.html" rel="external">levonorgestrel IUDs</a> but greater than the rate in TCu380A <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="93719" href="/z/d/drug information/93719.html" rel="external">copper IUD</a> users (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5422.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications", section on 'Pregnancy'</a>). There are no data on ectopic pregnancy risk following bilateral salpingectomy for female permanent contraception. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3307.html" rel="external">"Female interval permanent contraception: Procedures", section on 'Ectopic pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing and surgical planning</strong> – Providers must offer an alternative form of contraception until surgery is performed. Unplanned pregnancies can occur while the patient waits for her operation. (See <a class="local">'Timing and surgical approach'</a> below and <a class="local">'Postpartum permanent contraception'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical and anesthetic risks</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3307.html" rel="external">"Female interval permanent contraception: Procedures", section on 'Complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101866.html" rel="external">"Postpartum permanent contraception: Procedures", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lack of prevention from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</strong> – Permanent contraception does not prevent the transmission of STIs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7595.html" rel="external">"Prevention of sexually transmitted infections", section on 'Male condom use'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Special considerations when counseling patients with mental illness or disability are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Vulnerable populations'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20185900"><span class="h2">Regret after permanent contraception procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients are satisfied with their decision to undergo a permanent contraception procedure, but some patients experience regret. Rates of regret after permanent contraception vary widely among studies, ranging from 2 to 26 percent [<a href="#rid16">16,22</a>]. </p><p>It is unclear the extent to which the available data on rates of permanent contraception regret represent true differences as there are significant regional, population, and methodologic differences across studies, including how regret was ascertained or measured, time since permanent contraception, and whether incidence or prevalence in a population was measured. In surveys, higher rates of regret appear more common in the United States than in Europe and in resource-limited countries. Despite variations in expressed regret, rates of request for reversal appear consistent, with most studies reporting rates between 1 and 4 percent [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>If a provider has any concern about the patient's understanding of the permanence of the procedure, the risk of regret, or is concerned that the patient is not making the decision independently or is being coerced, additional measures such as a social worker referral may be appropriate. Each individual provider must ensure that, in counseling patients with any of the risk factors below, the patient demonstrates understanding of how these issues might change over time and potentially impact future desire for permanent contraception.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3424279342"><span class="h3">Risk factors for regret</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Much of the following data regarding regret were derived from the CREST study [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Though CREST remains the most comprehensive prospective study of patients undergoing permanent contraception in the United States, it reports outcomes for patients undergoing procedures during the 1970s and 1980s, when both medical care and societal equity were notably different. At least one subsequent study has challenged some of the CREST findings regarding risk of regret, as detailed below [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Young age</strong> – Studies have shown young age at the time of a permanent contraception procedure to be a strong predictor for regret, seeking information about permanent contraception reversal, obtaining a reversal, or undergoing a post-permanent contraception IVF procedure [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Studies that included very young females (eg, ages 18 to 24) showed the highest risk of regret and/or request for reversal in this age group [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The risk of regret appears to decrease incrementally with increasing age [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Young age as a predictor of regret is consistent across a large number of studies [<a href="#rid23">23,25</a>], with the CREST study demonstrating a 14-year cumulative risk of regret among females ages ≤30 and &gt;30 years of 20.3 and 5.9 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In addition, those ages ≤30 were 7.6 times more likely (95% CI 3.2-18.3) to undergo tubal reversal than those sterilized at an age &gt;30.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A subsequent retrospective study using data from 2015 to 2019 and including 1549 patients who underwent permanent contraception (median age 29 years) challenges the finding of age at time of permanent contraception as a risk factor for regret. In this study the cumulative rate of regret was 10.2 percent. In unadjusted analysis, those undergoing the procedure between the ages of 21 and 30 compared with &gt;30 years experienced higher rates of regret (12.6 versus 6.7 percent) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, after controlling for age at the time of the study, age at time of permanent contraception was no longer statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, the only remaining predictor of regret was current age, with regret being inversely related to time since procedure. For example, for patients &gt;30 years, the rate of regret at 0 to 5 compared with 11 to 15 years after the permanent contraception procedure was 9 versus 3 percent; similarly, for patients 21 to 30 years, the rate of regret at 0 to 5 compared with 11 to 15 years after the permanent contraception procedure was 16 versus 13 percent. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Black race</strong> – In the CREST study, Black females who were ≤30 years at the time of the permanent contraception procedure had among the highest cumulative rates of regret (29.5 percent) over the 14-year study period [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In the subsequent retrospective study including 1549 patients mentioned above, there was a trend toward increased rates of regret in Black patients compared with White patients (18.8 versus 8.6 percent); however, this was not statistically significant [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The authors note that the relationship between race and regret continues to deserve further study, as Black populations have historically experienced reproductive coercion as well as poor access to and denial of sterilization procedures. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Single marital status</strong> – Being unmarried at the time of a permanent contraception procedure was found to have an adjusted RR of 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.6) in CREST [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Young females ages 18 to 30 were also more likely to cite divorce or remarriage as a reason for regret than those older than 30 (23.9 versus 8.0 percent). Being unmarried or remarried is also associated with seeking reversal [<a href="#rid22">22,27,29</a>]. It is also important to note that, as marital patterns and the social value of marriage change with time, the impact of marriage versus non-marriage, as it was defined in the CREST data, might be a less valuable risk factor than some other assessment of relationship stability.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Delay after childbearing</strong> – For those having an interval permanent contraception procedure, in the CREST data, regret appeared to decrease as time increased between the birth of the youngest child and the procedure [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Patients who had an interval permanent contraception procedure two to three years after the birth of their youngest child had an adjusted RR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.1-1.8) as compared with those having it at eight years or more, or with no previous births.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who undergo an immediate postpartum permanent contraception procedure have an increased risk of regret.

This may not be a good measure of regret because there are many barriers to obtaining a tubal reversal or IVF, including limited availability, need to undergo an invasive procedure, and expense. In CREST, the likelihood of obtaining reversal for females ≤30 and &gt;30 years of age at the time of permanent contraception was 2.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

In addition, tubal ligation has consistently been shown to decrease epithelial ovarian cancer risk in large retrospective studies; most of these studies do not specify tubal ligation technique. The potential benefits of tubal ligation on ovarian cancer risk reduction have led to an increase in complete salpingectomy as the preferred technique for patients requesting permanent contraception. However, because of the young age of most patients undergoing complete salpingectomy for permanent contraception, the exact magnitude of this benefit specific to this group will take time to validate. This strategy of opportunistic salpingectomy is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91886.html" rel="external">"Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3307.html" rel="external">"Female interval permanent contraception: Procedures", section on 'Complete salpingectomy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postablation tubal sterilization syndrome</strong> – Patients who have had permanent contraception and subsequently undergo endometrial ablation can experience cyclic or intermittent pelvic pain, which is referred to as postablation tubal sterilization syndrome (PATSS).

Most experts agree that biologic factors do not explain this association and suggest that these individuals may be more likely to seek surgery for treatment of later gynecologic disorders [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Within five years following permanent contraception, individuals in CREST and in a large Kaiser Permanente cohort had a higher likelihood of undergoing hysterectomy compared with those whose partners had a vasectomy or were not sterilized. The risk of hysterectomy in CREST was not associated with the type of technique used for permanent contraception, age at permanent contraception, history of prior pelvic surgery, or other gynecologic conditions [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Among individuals in the Kaiser cohort, there was a suggestion of increased risk of pelvic pain and menstrual complaints following tubal ligation; however, higher risk of hysterectomy was not associated with occlusion methods that destroyed more tissue, creating an argument against a biologic effect of the permanent contraception procedure [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Possible</strong> <strong>decreased rates of endometrial cancer</strong> – Patients with permanent contraception may have a decreased risk of developing endometrial cancer. In a meta-analysis of eight cohort and case-controlled studies, tubal ligation was associated with lower rates of endometrial cancer (pooled unadjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.79) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, there was huge heterogeneity across the studies, and confounding appeared to contribute substantially to the observed effect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When endometrial cancer does occur, patients who have had a tubal ligation appear to be diagnosed at a lower stage and have a lower risk of metastatic disease [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

In CREST, female permanent contraception was associated with a modest decrease in the volume of flow and duration of menstrual bleeding, and less menstrual pain; however, there was an increase in cycle irregularity [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. In a cross-sectional study, permanent contraception appeared to be associated with an increase in menstrual flow, but the effect was limited only to those with a prior cesarean birth [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ovarian reserve</strong> – There is no strong evidence that patients undergoing permanent contraception will experience earlier onset of menopause. Studies of hormone levels and ovarian reserve have demonstrated no significant changes or inconsistent effects after permanent contraception. In a cross-sectional study comparing follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol levels in the early follicular phase, no statistically significant difference was found between patients with and without a history of prior tubal ligation [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Studies specifically evaluating ovarian reserve following tubal ligation by electrocoagulation found no changes in hormone levels at 3 months after the procedure [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>] or at 10 months; although a decrease in antral follicle count and ovarian volume has been observed, no corresponding changes in serum hormone levels were noted [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Similarly, in a randomized trial including patients undergoing permanent contraception at time of cesarean birth, those undergoing complete salpingectomy compared with tubal ligation had similar postoperative levels of anti-Müllerian hormone [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sexual function</strong> – Sexual function appears unchanged or improved after female permanent contraception compared with those not undergoing such procedures.

Several studies have shown that a significant proportion of unfulfilled postpartum permanent contraception requests are due to instances in which the federal requirements have not been met [<a href="#rid45">45-51,53,54</a>]. As discussed above, in the United States, for patients covered by Medicaid, the federal sterilization consent form must be correctly signed and dated between 30 and 180 days prior to the procedure and be available at the time of the procedure (see <a class="local">'United States regulatory issues'</a> above). In a single-institution study, only 52 percent of patients received their requested postpartum permanent contraception procedure, and of those with unfulfilled requests, almost one-half (44 percent) were unfulfilled due to lack of valid federally mandated consent [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Counseling and consent</strong> – The general principles regarding counseling a pregnant patient for permanent contraception are similar to counseling a nonpregnant patient and are described above (see <a class="local">'Counseling and informed consent'</a> above).

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists provides guidance for providers on how to deal with these situations [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Clinicians must remember that their ethical duty is to do no harm and be aware of both the potential for coercion of vulnerable patients as well as the inappropriateness of blanket denials for permanent contraception because of disabilities. Clinicians must also be aware that there are differing federal, state, and local laws that pertain to permanent contraception in individuals with limited decision-making capacity. For example, federal funds may not be used for permanent contraception of those deemed "mentally incompetent" or institutionalized.</p><p>Clinicians must try to ascertain patients' own desires and wishes regarding childbearing as well as their capacity for decision making. In situations of chronic mental illness in which decision-making capacity may be variable over time, the clinician should do their best to evaluate such patients at a time when their mental state and medications are optimized. When appropriate, the clinician should also seek counsel from the patient's family and caregivers. Standards for legal competence are complex, and requirements for court approval are variable as well. Clinicians must be aware of local laws and regulations. We recommend that clinicians seek ethical and legal counsel in any situation in which there is not complete agreement between the patient, caregivers, and provider; in any guardianship arrangement; or in any situation in which the patient is not able to be involved in the consent process.
