         Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is characterized by mood elevated syndromes (eg, hypomania or mania), which are episodic, exceed what is expected for the child’s developmental stage, and are not better explained by other psychiatric and general medical conditions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. In addition, youth with bipolar disorder usually have episodic depressive syndromes (eg, major depression); however, depressive syndromes are not required for making the diagnosis. Pediatric bipolar disorder greatly disrupts normal development and psychosocial functioning, and increases the risk for behavioral, academic, social, and legal problems, as well as psychosis, substance abuse, and suicide [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple retrospective studies have reported that in up to 60 percent of adults with bipolar disorder, onset of mood symptoms occurred before age 20 [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. However, pediatric bipolar disorder is often not recognized, and many youth with the disorder do not receive treatment or are treated for comorbid conditions rather than bipolar disorder [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,9
         </a>
         ]. A retrospective study of 88 youth with bipolar disorder found that the duration of untreated bipolar disorder, from onset of the first mood episode to first mental health contact, was nearly two years [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Longer times between onset of the disorder and appropriate treatment are associated with worse outcomes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         This topic describes the clinical features and course of illness in pediatric bipolar disorder. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, comorbidity, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents are discussed separately.

          Bipolar I disorder

         <strong>
          Cyclothymic disorder
         </strong>
         – Cyclothymic disorder is diagnosed in patients with periods of hypomanic symptoms that fall short of meeting criteria for a hypomanic episode, and periods of depressive symptoms that fall short of meeting criteria for a major depressive episode. Symptoms recur over a time interval lasting at least one year, during which patients are symptomatic at least half the time and are not symptom-free for more than two consecutive months. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83083.html" rel="external">
          "Pediatric bipolar disorder: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Cyclothymic disorder'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Cyclothymic disorder is often as debilitating as bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-13
         </a>
         ]. As an example, the level of irritability and sleep disturbance in pediatric cyclothymic disorder each appear to be comparable to that for pediatric bipolar I disorder. In addition, youth with cyclothymic disorder typically have psychiatric comorbidity (eg, anxiety disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and the frequency of comorbidity is comparable to that for youth with bipolar I disorder. Most youths with cyclothymic disorder have at least one parent with bipolar disorder.

         <strong>
          Other specified bipolar disorder
         </strong>
         (previously called “bipolar disorder not otherwise specified”) – Bipolar symptoms that cause significant distress or impair psychosocial functioning, but do not meet the full criteria for bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or cyclothymic disorder, are diagnosed as other specified bipolar disorder [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,10
         </a>
         ]. This subtype of bipolar disorder may be difficult to differentiate from cyclothymic disorder [

         ]. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most youth with other specified bipolar disorder are phenomenologically similar to youth with bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder; most patients with other specified bipolar disorder do not meet the criteria for bipolar I or II disorder because they do not fulfill the duration criteria for mood episodes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,10,15-18
         </a>
         ]. As an example, youth with other specified bipolar disorder and youth with bipolar I or II disorder are comparable with regard to the frequency of psychotic features, suicidal ideation and behavior, psychiatric comorbidity (eg, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders), psychosocial impairment, and family history of mania.

        <p>

        <p>
         Some mood episodes manifest with concurrent symptoms of mania/hypomania and major depression, which are referred to as “mixed features.” (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mixed features'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Children and adolescents with bipolar disorder may also have psychotic features (eg, hallucinations and/or delusions), comorbid disorders (eg, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], disruptive behavior disorders, and/or substance use disorders), and suicide attempts [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In addition, youth with bipolar disorder are at high risk for hospitalization, unplanned pregnancies, physical or sexual abuse, general medical problems (eg, obesity), legal problems, interpersonal difficulties, and poor academic and occupational functioning [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6,20-25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple studies indicate that the first lifetime mood episode in pediatric bipolar disorder is typically major depression [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,26-28
         </a>
         ]. This is consistent with studies of adult bipolar disorder. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14642.html" rel="external">
          "Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Clinical presentation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there are developmental differences between youth and adults in the manifestation of manic, hypomanic, and major depressive symptoms [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Pediatric bipolar I disorder, compared with adult bipolar I disorder, is characterized by a greater number of mixed episodes (see
         <a class="local">
          'Mixed features'
         </a>
         below), rapid mood changes, and comorbid disorders such as disruptive behavior disorder and ADHD [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, it is more difficult to diagnose and treat youth with bipolar disorders than adults because youth have more difficulties expressing their symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among youth with bipolar disorder, the clinical features can differ depending upon age of onset and the patient’s current age. In a retrospective study that enrolled different subgroups of youth with bipolar disorder, interviews with the patients and parents found the following [

         The development, emergence, and progression of pediatric bipolar disorder can be staged along a continuum, according to clinical features such as prodromal mood and non-mood symptoms, mood elevated and depressive syndromes, course of illness, cognition, functioning, and comorbidities [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-31

         ]. However, there is no evidence that clinical staging improves outcomes, and it is thus reserved for specialized treatment or research settings.

         Youth with bipolar disorder often present to their pediatrician before they are seen by a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician, unless the patient is severely ill [

         The initial prodromal period is typically long. The same meta-analysis described immediately above found that the prodrome preceding an initial mood episode lasted an average of 27 months (range 5 to 130 months) [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. The length of the prodrome may be sufficient for clinicians to recognize it and intervene relatively early, which in turn may favorably alter the course of illness. Youth at relatively high risk of developing subsyndromal symptoms heralding onset of bipolar disorder include the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Offspring of bipolar parents'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Onset of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is more likely to occur in youth with prodromal signs and symptoms. An eight-year, prospective study included a nationally representative sample of 11 year olds; at baseline, three groups of children were identified regarding the number of subthreshold manic symptoms: none (n = 916), relatively few (average of 6 symptoms, n = 843), and relatively more (average of 10 symptoms, n = 198) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, family history of psychopathology and socioeconomic status), the analyses found that compared to youth with no prodrome, the risk of new-onset, syndromal bipolar disorder at age 19 years was greater in youth with either a few prodromal symptoms (hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0) or more symptoms (hazard ratio 3.7, 95% CI 1.5-8.9).
        </p>
        <p>
         Prodromal signs and symptoms of diagnosable bipolar disorder can also occur as part of other psychiatric disorders that usually predate the onset of bipolar disorder, such as anxiety disorders, ADHD, and oppositional defiant disorder [
         <a href="#rid35">

         ) typically manifests as a cluster of symptoms denoting an increase in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral activity. During episodes of mania, youth can present with elation (euphoria) and/or irritability, increased energy, grandiose ideation or delusions, rapid and disorganized thinking, rapid (pressured) speech, distractibility, decreased need for sleep (eg, either sleeping a few hours at night or awake all night, and awake the next day without fatigue), behavioral/interpersonal difficulties, and hypersexuality, as well as increased goal-directed activity, agitation, impulsivity, and risky behaviors [

        </p>
        <p>
         Some investigators have argued that mania in children is mainly manifested with chronic symptoms of severe irritability, even if the irritability does not occur episodically. However, irritability alone may not be sufficient to diagnosis mania, as mania rarely occurs without elation, and chronic (nonepisodic) irritability is usually associated with other disorders (eg, oppositional defiant disorder and ADHD), rather than bipolar disorder [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         ]. However, a youth with bipolar disorder plus comorbidity may have chronic irritability that increases during manic or depressive mood episodes.

        <p>
         A meta-analysis of 20 observational studies (total n &gt;2000, average age 11 years) evaluated the frequency of manic symptoms in youth with bipolar I disorder and youth with other specified bipolar disorder [

         The most frequent symptoms that are specific for bipolar disorder were grandiosity (57 percent) and hypersexuality (32 percent) [

          41
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms of mania in youth need to be distinguished from normal behavior, particularly symptoms of grandiosity, elation, and increased goal-directed activity; the line between normal behavior and psychopathology, particularly in young children, can be challenging. In general, the symptoms likely represent bipolar disorder if they are episodic, appear in clusters, affect the child’s psychosocial functioning, are not primarily due to other psychiatric or medical disorders, and are more severe than what is expected for the child’s developmental age and environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Manic symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder and ADHD [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. These overlapping symptoms include increased activity, agitation, irritability, distractibility, and talkativeness. Manic symptoms may be distinguished from overlapping comorbid symptoms by clear worsening during the episode of mania. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83083.html" rel="external">
          "Pediatric bipolar disorder: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and DMDD'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If symptoms are episodic, typical, and pronounced, the diagnosis of mania is relatively easy; however, many cases require repeated assessments to determine whether the symptoms appear episodically and in clusters, and thus represent mania rather than other conditions. The assessment and diagnosis of pediatric mania  (

          table 1

         It is normal for children to overestimate or brag about their abilities and believe that they are the best at a particular sport, smarter than others, or will be very important. Some children, particularly those with oppositional defiant or conduct disorders, may also brag excessively or believe that they do not need to follow adult rules and requests. Manic grandiosity can be distinguished from these other presentations if it represents a change from the child’s usual behavior. In addition, the belief that one has special abilities or is much better than others is fixed and unyielding, and the child acts upon these beliefs. As with other manic symptoms, grandiosity does not appear in isolation, but rather, occurs in conjunction with other symptoms of mania.

         Examples that raise suspicion that the grandiosity is pathologic include:

         To be counted as a symptom of mania in youth, increased goal-directed activity must be exaggerated, represent a change in functioning, and be recognized by others as excessive given the developmental age of the child. Recognizing the symptom can be more difficult in children than in adolescents or adults, particularly if the child has comorbid disorders such as ADHD. Examples of potentially manic, goal-directed behavior include situations in which the youth:

         To be counted as a manic symptom, increased sexual activity needs to be inappropriate for the age of the youth and not primarily accounted for by a history of sexual abuse or by exposure to others’ sexual activity (eg, movies). For children, this can manifest as preoccupation with viewing or drawing naked people; provocative touching of the breasts, genital area, or buttocks of others; or sexually explicit dancing. The periodicity, frequency, intensity, and temporal association between these activities and elevated and/or irritable mood are key factors when assessing potential hypersexual behavior. Mild expressions of these behaviors may be normal if they are transient and do not impair functioning.

         Due to increased energy, youth with mania or hypomania usually require less sleep (few hours or none) for the duration of the episode. Despite the relative lack of sleep at night, the youth feels rested the next day. If not accounted for by other causes (eg, use of substances), this symptom should raise the suspicion of bipolar disorder, especially if it occurs episodically in conjunction with other manic symptoms.

         ) are similar to the ones described for mania, but of lesser intensity and severity. As an example, the youth may become more talkative, sleep less, be more intrusive and outgoing, and be unable to still in class. In some instances, hypomania may improve functioning from baseline, such that the youth is more creative and “sharper,” and finishes school assignments faster and more accurately. Symptoms of hypomania may be difficult to differentiate from normal adolescent mood and behaviors and require careful longitudinal evaluation.

         ) are prominent features in most phenomenological studies of pediatric bipolar disorder, and adults with bipolar disorder frequently recall having significant depressive symptoms in childhood or adolescence [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42-44
         </a>
         ]. In contrast to mania, there is an overall decrease in emotion, cognition, and energy during an episode of major depression. Depression is manifested by persistent sadness and/or irritability, diminished ability to enjoy activities (anhedonia), lack of motivation, isolation, fatigue, low levels of activity, poor concentration, hopelessness, negative thoughts, and suicidal ideation or attempts [
         <a href="#rid45">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The symptoms of major depression extend beyond what is expected for the youth’s environment and developmental age. In addition, the symptoms cluster concurrently in episodes. If the youth has comorbid disorders with symptoms that overlap with major depression (eg, irritability due to oppositional defiant disorder and generalized anxiety disorder or poor concentration due to ADHD), these symptoms worsen during the episode of major depression [
         <a href="#rid46">

         Bipolar disorder in adolescents typically starts with a depressive syndrome [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,27,28,34,38
         </a>
         ]. However, most depressed youth seen at psychiatric clinics are experiencing their first episode of unipolar major depression [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Although some clinical features (eg, relatively severe depression) may suggest bipolar major depression rather than unipolar major depression [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ], it is not possible to know at the time of first assessment who will go on to develop mania/hypomania. Thus, all patients who initially present with depressive syndromes should be assessed for a history of subsyndromal or syndromal manic or hypomanic symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychotic features, psychiatric comorbidity (eg, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders), pharmacologically induced mania/hypomania, or family history of bipolar disorder may indicate susceptibility to develop bipolar disorder [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,47
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Offspring of bipolar parents'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Children develop the cognitive maturity to describe emotions, thoughts, and behaviors as they age; thus, the younger the child, the more difficult it is to ascertain the symptoms of major depression (and manic/hypomanic symptoms) and differentiate major depression from other disorders. As an example, the intent to act on suicidal thoughts may not be recognized because children may choose methods that are not lethal, such as holding their breath or putting their head under water in the bathtub. Younger children may not report feeling depressed, but only irritable or bored [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The combination of depressive symptoms and difficulty expressing their mood may make children more susceptible to behavior problems, such as rebelling against parents and teachers (eg, not doing homework), low frustration tolerance, and frequent temper outbursts. These behaviors may be misinterpreted as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and the symptoms of depression may be overlooked.
        </p>
        <p>
         Children tend not to have as many “melancholic” symptoms (eg, anhedonia, lack of motivation, tiredness, lack of appetite, and insomnia) as depressed adolescents or adults. In addition, depressed children may still be active in sports and music, but not enjoy these activities as much, or continue to do well at school, but take longer to do their homework. Adolescents may tend to have more hypersomnia than insomnia, and increased appetite than lack of appetite. For all youth, anhedonia is usually not ubiquitous and may be specific to activities that require more mental effort [
         <a href="#rid46">

        </p>
        <p>
         Youth with subsyndromal depressive symptoms can have as much impairment as those with the full syndrome of major depression, and are at risk for psychosocial problems and suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, youth with subsyndromal depressive symptoms are at high risk to develop major depressive episodes later in life [

         Rapid cycling is defined as four or more distinct mood episodes of mania, hypomania, or major depression during a 12-month period, with each episode demarcated by partial or full remission for at least two months, or by a change in polarity [

          Developmental differences

         – Among children, adolescents, and adults, there are developmental differences in the clinical manifestation of bipolar disorder. Pediatric bipolar I disorder, compared with adult bipolar I disorder, is characterized by a greater number of mixed episodes, rapid mood changes, and comorbid disorders. (See

          Prodrome
         </strong>
         – Onset of pediatric bipolar disorder is often preceded by a prodrome. However, across different patients, the prodrome is heterogenous. Except for subsyndromal manic symptoms, the prodromal signs and symptoms that precede onset of bipolar disorder are not specific and can occur in other psychiatric disorders that frequently predate onset of bipolar disorder.

         <strong>
          Mania
         </strong>
         – Mania typically manifests as a cluster of symptoms denoting an increase in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral activity, including elation and/or irritability, distractibility, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and increased goal-directed activity  (

          Major depression
         </strong>
         – In contrast to mania, episodes of major depression manifest with an overall decrease in emotion, cognition, and activity  (

          Psychotic features
         </strong>
         – Episodes of mania or major depression may be accompanied by psychotic features, including delusions, hallucinations, and/or thought disorder. (See

          Suicidality
         </strong>
         – Among youth with bipolar disorder, suicide attempts occur in approximately 25 to 50 percent, and the risk of completed suicide is elevated. (See

          'Suicidality'

         <strong>
          Cognition
         </strong>
         – Pediatric bipolar disorder typically includes impairment of cognitive functioning, including global cognition, verbal learning, verbal memory, working memory, visual learning, and visual memory. (See

         <strong>
          Psychosocial functioning
         </strong>
         – Bipolar disorder in youth is associated with psychosocial impairment and increased risk for substance abuse, legal problems, and academic, familial, and social difficulties. (See

         <strong>
          Course of illness
         </strong>
         – The course of illness in youth with bipolar disorder is often heterogenous, with periods of recovery from mood episodes and recurrences. Although most patients recover from their mood episodes, periods of euthymia may be relatively short and the disorder typically manifests with persistent fluctuating syndromal and subsyndromal symptoms, particularly depressive symptoms and mixed features. However, a substantial proportion of patients may experience prolonged periods without mood symptoms. Risk factors for worse outcomes include early age of onset, low socioeconomic status, and comorbidity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Course of illness'

         <strong>
          Offspring of bipolar parents
         </strong>
         – Approximately 15 to 25 percent of the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder develop the disorder. However, if a child of a parent with bipolar disorder has ongoing mood lability, anxiety, depression, and subsyndromal manic symptoms, and the parent has early onset bipolar disorder (age ≤18 years), the risk of developing bipolar disorder is nearly 50 percent.
