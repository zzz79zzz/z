(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129424.html" rel="external">"Basic genetics concepts: Chromosomes and cell division", section on 'Mitosis'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, meiosis is the process of generating germline cells (also called gametes, or egg and sperm). Meiosis generates four haploid cells. Due to chromosome recombination during meiosis, paternal and maternal chromosome pairs cross over and exchange homologous DNA segments, generating new haploid genomes with unique combinations of genetic variants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129424.html" rel="external">"Basic genetics concepts: Chromosomes and cell division", section on 'Meiosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H578496538"><span class="h2">Monogenic traits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monogenic disorders (monogenic traits) are conditions that result from functional variation in a single gene with high phenotypic impact (large genetic effect size). </p><p>These traits are typically recognized by their striking inheritance patterns corresponding to the co-segregation of the disease gene and unique phenotypes within kindreds. </p><p>Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sickle cell anemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cystic fibrosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Huntington disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Duchenne muscular dystrophy</p><p></p><p>Although some disorders can be caused by variation in one of several genes (eg, four genes in familial hypercholesterolemia, &gt;40 genes in primary ciliary dyskinesia), the term monogenic applies when variation in only one gene is sufficient to manifest the phenotype.</p><p>By contrast, complex disorders (complex traits) are those in which variants involving multiple genes, each with small phenotypic impact (small genetic effect size) combine to manifest a phenotype, often together with environmental factors. These include many complex disorders such as cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, and cancer susceptibility. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14600.html" rel="external">"Principles of complex trait genetics"</a>.) </p><p>Most rare genetic disorders are monogenic. However, even among monogenic disorders, not all inherited traits follow typical Mendelian inheritance patterns. Modifying effects by other genes, epigenetic changes, or environmental factors can complicate recognition of Mendelian inheritance and make it appear to follow a "non-Mendelian" pattern. Causes of non-Mendelian inheritance patterns are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Causes of non-Mendelian inheritance'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1515498338"><span class="h2">Mendel's laws</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gregor Mendel was an Augustinian monk and botanist who made observations from a large series of crossbreeding experiments of plants with varying flowering characteristics [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Mendel noted that many physical characteristics of seeds and flowers were transmitted from parental strains to offspring in a predictable and reproducible manner. </p><p>From these observations, Mendel proposed that traits manifest through the joint effects of two paired elements; these elements were later recognized as genes. Each parent contributes one element, or allele, to each offspring at conception. He further discerned that two elements (genes) encoding characteristics that were co-inherited must be transmitted jointly, and, while many traits manifest in offspring as a blending (or averaging) of two distinct parental variations, there were also many examples in which only one of the two parental variants was manifest in offspring (where one trait was dominant to another).</p><p>Based on his observations, he proposed the following laws of inheritance, published in 1866 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Law of segregation</strong> – The law of segregation states that paired parental copies of genes are separated from each other during gamete formation, with each parental copy (ie, allele) segregating into separate gametes. This process of gamete formation is now known as meiosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129424.html" rel="external">"Basic genetics concepts: Chromosomes and cell division", section on 'Meiosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Law of independent assortment</strong> – The law of independent assortment states that genes segregate into gametes independently from other genes such that the allelic status at one locus does not determine segregation of alleles at other loci. This is only true for genes that are not linked to each other (ie, it is only true for genes that do not reside in close proximity to each other on a chromosome).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Law of dominance</strong> – The law of dominance distinguishes dominant, recessive, and co-dominant traits.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dominant </strong>– A trait is considered dominant when one allele is sufficient to confer the trait. Thus, dominant traits typically manifest in heterozygous carriers or heterozygotes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Recessive </strong>– A trait is considered recessive when it is observed only among individuals who carry trait-causing variants on both copies of a gene. This typically involves disease-causing variants that are inherited from both the mother and the father. Recessive traits manifest in individuals who carry the same disease-causing variant on both maternal and paternal copies of the gene), or in individuals who carry two different disease-causing variants, one on the maternally-inherited copy of the gene and one on the paternally-inherited copy (compound heterozygotes). Individuals who are heterozygous for a recessive trait (carriers) are typically phenotypically indistinguishable from unaffected individuals. In some recessive diseases, carrier status can confer increased risk for some disease features. In X-linked disorders, carrier females can sometimes be affected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Co-dominant </strong>– A co-dominant or semidominant trait is one in which both alleles contribute equally to phenotypic expression. Heterozygous individuals manifest an intermediate phenotype between those of the two homozygous classes. This is particularly relevant for quantitative traits such as protein levels. For example, for the alpha-1-antitrypsin locus (<em>SERPINA1</em> gene), Pi, MZ heterozygotes (carriers of one normal M allele and one pathogenic Z variant) have serum levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin that are approximately midway between ZZ and MM homozygous individuals.</p><p></p><p>These laws were translated to the clinical setting by Sir Archibald Garrod and published in 1902, launching the study of medical genetics [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p>The true genius of Mendel was that his postulates were put forward without any knowledge of their molecular basis. Demonstration of DNA as the heritable genetic material came decades later (DNA was identified in 1943, and the structure of the double helix elucidated in 1953).</p><p>Although there is a molecular correlate to inheritance patterns, it is the trait (the phenotype or clinical presentation) rather than the genotype that segregates as dominant or recessive. Humans are diploid, and genes (genotypes) are inherited with an equal contribution from each parent. Recognition of Mendelian inheritance requires obtaining a detailed family history and thorough review of pedigree information. Often a three-generation pedigree is required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103304.html" rel="external">"Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177464532"><span class="h1">MENDELIAN INHERITANCE PATTERNS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3802853562"><span class="h2">Overview and definitions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mendelian inheritance refers to the collection of patterns of expression of physical traits over two or more generations in a kindred that follow the rules of parental-to-offspring transmission (autosomal or sex-linked, dominant or recessive) that Mendel first described  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78050" href="/z/d/graphic/78050.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Mendel's laws'</a> above.)</p><p>These patterns are attributable to the actions of single genes. They are most clinically recognizable for rare, highly penetrant monogenic diseases. (See <a class="local">'Penetrance and expressivity'</a> below.)</p><p>A Mendelian (monogenic) trait is a clinical feature or attribute (disease, phenotype) that follows a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. More than 10,000 Mendelian traits and disorders have been described. Many of these are cataloged in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2F&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o%2BGEGTWEVgCk7IS97EvcRKgoDPvN8%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2897" target="_blank">http://omim.org/</a>), a manually curated and regularly updated comprehensive database of Mendelian and non-Mendelian traits and associated genes.</p><p>Typical patterns of Mendelian inheritance include autosomal dominant (AD)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63306" href="/z/d/graphic/63306.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110421" href="/z/d/graphic/110421.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), autosomal recessive (AR)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50124" href="/z/d/graphic/50124.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110582" href="/z/d/graphic/110582.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>), X-linked  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75137" href="/z/d/graphic/75137.html" rel="external">figure 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55180" href="/z/d/graphic/55180.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>), and Y-linked  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69653" href="/z/d/graphic/69653.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>); their characteristics are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78050" href="/z/d/graphic/78050.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These patterns depend on two features: whether the trait is dominant or recessive, and whether the trait is sex-linked. </p><p>The term X-linked recessive inheritance has classically been used to describe conditions in which the phenotypic trait is manifested in males and transmitted through asymptomatic, or carrier, females. However, due to skewed (uneven) X-inactivation, females can also manifest the clinical features of X-linked conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2898.html" rel="external">"Genetics: Glossary of terms", section on 'X-inactivation'</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance is considered by some to be arbitrary, and it has been suggested that the term X-linked inheritance is an effective term that encompasses both types of inheritance. An example of this is X-linked tubular myopathy, in which carriers typically show no signs of the disease, but carriers can also be affected with a range of disease severity, including generalized weakness that presents in infancy or childhood (resembling affected males), to mild, asymmetric weakness that starts in adulthood. In this and similar diseases that do not follow classic X-linked recessive inheritance, the distinction between X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant inheritance can be blurred.</p><p>Terminology is evolving for referring to changes in DNA sequence. The term "mutation" was previously used to refer to disease-causing changes in DNA. However, with greater use of DNA sequencing, base pair changes are increasingly detected for which the health implications are unknown, and use of the term "mutation" may imply a degree of pathogenicity that has not actually been established. As a result, several groups, including the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), have recommended that the term "variant" be adopted to describe a change in DNA sequence. They have established a five-tier system for assessing pathogenicity, as discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96539.html" rel="external">"Secondary findings from genetic testing", section on 'Definitions and classification of variants'</a>.)</p><p>The term "mutation" continues to be used on rare occasions by some experts to refer to pathogenic variants, especially those with familiar names and/or when brevity is desirable (eg, "factor V Leiden mutation"). However, the term variant is preferred by many genetics professionals; the term "mutation" can be reserved for observed mutational events that lead to de novo variation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H992909105"><span class="h2">Pedigrees</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pedigree is a valuable tool in clinical genetics. It provides a graphic representation of familial relationships and enables visualization of trait segregation within families, as well as co-segregation with specific genotype markers or sequence variants. Pedigrees are routinely constructed during genetic counseling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103304.html" rel="external">"Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment", section on 'Pedigree'</a>.)</p><p>Standard pedigree symbols are used to illustrate the sex of each individual, the relationships between individuals, and the presence of one or more traits [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Males and females are denoted by squares and circles, respectively.

A double horizontal line denotes parental consanguinity (genetically-related parents who share in common other biologic relatives besides their children), as shown in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50124" href="/z/d/graphic/50124.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A diagonal line through the symbol for an individual denotes that the individual has died. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Filling of symbols is used to denote that the individual expresses a trait of interest. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unaffected carrier status is designated differently for X-linked disorders (indicated by a dot in the center of the symbol) versus AR disorders (indicated by a half-filled symbol). </p><p></p><p>Additional filling patterns with an accompanying legend can be used to convey expression patterns of multiple phenotypes. Additional examples are provided in an update from the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) and various websites [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2556263634"><span class="h2">Punnett squares</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Punnett squares (named for the British geneticist Reginald Punnett) are used to illustrate and calculate the probability of all potential offspring genotypes, or alleles, resulting in offspring from a specific pair of parents. </p><p>Columns denote the two alleles contributed by the father and rows denote the two alleles contributed by the mother (paternal and maternal alleles, respectively). Each cell (square) thus represents the offspring genotype resulting from the specific combination of paternal and maternal alleles. </p><p>As an example, in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110421" href="/z/d/graphic/110421.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) the upper right cell provides the product of a paternally inherited pathogenic variant (D) with a maternally inherited wild-type variant (d). Overlay of modes of inheritance and penetrance functions are used to denote trait expression. In this example, the shaded squares in the rightmost column denote trait-expressing genotypes, reflecting an AD mode of inheritance. The squares can be adapted to accommodate multigenic models.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1960911748"><span class="h2">Autosomal patterns</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Autosomal dominant</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance is observed by dominant traits mapping to one of the autosomal, or non-sex, chromosomes. Autosomal traits manifest in both males and females equally and are transmitted by either parent to approximately 50 percent of their offspring  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110421" href="/z/d/graphic/110421.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Because causative gene variants for AD conditions are typically rare, most affected individuals are heterozygous for the pathogenic gene variant, with the other copy of the gene having typical, or wild-type, sequence. Many AD disease-causing variants are not inherited but occur "de novo," arising from a new germline mutational event that is present in the offspring's somatic cells but is not present in either parent. Offspring may also inherit the variant from a heterozygous (and therefore affected) parent. </p><p>According to the law of independent assortment, an affected heterozygous parent has a 50 percent chance of transmitting the variant to a child in each pregnancy. The affected children in turn will transmit the variant to 50 percent of their offspring. Offspring who do not inherit the variant are unaffected and have no variant to pass to their offspring.</p><p>AD traits often result from "gain-of-function" variants, whereby the variant confers a novel, deleterious function that cannot be overcome by the other normal functioning allele. Examples include Huntington disease (MIM#143100), familial Mediterranean fever (MIM#249100), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 1 (MIM#118200).</p><p>Some AD traits result from loss-of-function variants, for which a 50 percent reduction in gene activity (haploinsufficiency) is sufficient to cause disease. AD traits can also be caused by gene variants that prevent typical function of the corresponding protein and also interfere with the function of the protein arising from the typical, or wild-type, allele of the gene (so-called "dominant negative variants"). Pathogenic variants in aquoporin-2 (<em>AQP2</em>) that cause AD arginine vasopressin resistance (previously called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; MIM#125800) are an example of dominant negative alleles.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Autosomal recessive</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance is observed for recessive traits mapping to one of the autosomal chromosomes. As an autosomal trait, AR inheritance manifests equally in both males and females, and deleterious alleles are classically transmitted by both parents to an affected offspring  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110582" href="/z/d/graphic/110582.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p>An AR disorder does not typically manifest in heterozygotes (ie, heterozygotes are typically unaffected carriers), and parents are almost always unaffected. Examples of AR traits include sickle cell anemia (MIM#603903), cystic fibrosis (MIM#219700), and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (MIM#107400). As noted below, heterozygotes may have mild disease manifestations. (See <a class="local">'Mild disease manifestations in individuals who are heterozygous for autosomal recessive disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Because two deleterious gene variants are required to manifest an AR disease, parents of affected individuals each must be obligate carriers of one disease-causing variant in the same gene, with rare exceptions such as uniparental disomy. Each heterozygous parent has a 50 percent likelihood of transmitting the variant, so there is a 25 percent probability that an offspring will inherit both disease-causing variants and manifest the AR trait. On average, 25 percent of an affected individual's siblings will be affected, 25 percent will carry no variants, and 50 percent will be unaffected carriers.</p><p>Though AR disorders result when both copies of a gene are dysfunctional, the causative variants observed in a given patient need not be the same. Often, the affected individual is compound heterozygous, having inherited two different variants in the same gene on opposite alleles (also referred to as "trans" or "biallelic inheritance"). This contrasts with digenic inheritance, which describes disorders that result from the combination of pathogenic variants in two different genes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2898.html" rel="external">"Genetics: Glossary of terms"</a>.)</p><p>As an example, the most common pathogenic variant that causes cystic fibrosis (the DF508 variant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [<em>CFTR</em>]) is observed on 70 percent of cystic fibrosis chromosomes worldwide, but only 49 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis are homozygous for this variant. Of the remainder, 42 percent are compound heterozygous for DF508 and a second pathogenic variant in <em>CFTR</em>, and 9 percent are either homozygous or compound heterozygous for non-DF508 variants in <em>CFTR</em>.

This is because allele sharing among relatives is much higher than between unrelated individuals, particularly for pathogenic variants for rare disorders that have low population frequencies. </p><p>Specifically, the probability of two blood relatives both inheriting (and sharing) the same pathogenic variant from a common ancestor is a function of the degree of their relatedness (ie, 0.5 for siblings, 0.125 for first cousins, 0.03125 for second cousins). These probabilities are typically orders of magnitude higher than the probability of two unrelated individuals carrying a rare pathogenic variant. Similarly, for rare variants with frequencies that are higher in specific ancestral groups, the incidence of AR disease will be higher in kindreds in which both parents are from the same ancestral group. </p><p>Tay-Sachs disease, a fatal AR condition caused by loss-of-function variants in the <em>HEXA</em> gene, illustrates these probabilities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The carrier frequency of <em>HEXA </em>loss-of-function variants is approximately 1 in 250 (0.4 percent) in the general population.

X-linked inheritance can be described as dominant or recessive; however, this distinction is becoming less frequently used. </p><p>Examples of X-linked recessive disorders are red-green color blindness or hemophilia (A or B), where males are affected far more often than females, and the conditions are transmitted to them from their (typically unaffected) mothers. As noted above, some believe a use of the terms X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant inheritance creates an artificial distinction [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Some female carriers of hemophilia disease variants are in fact affected, although typically to a lesser degree than male relatives. (See <a class="local">'Overview and definitions'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1310.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia", section on 'Bleeding in females/carriers'</a>.)</p><p>X-linked disorders are typically recognized by the predominance of clinical manifestations in males, since males carry only one X chromosome and are reliant on normal functioning of the genes carried on that chromosome. Females can manifest the phenotype if they are homozygous (or compound heterozygous) for a particular gene variant, which would only occur in the rare event that both the father and mother are carriers, or one is a carrier and there is a new germline variant. However, due to X-chromosome inactivation in committed cell lineages, heterozygous females occasionally manifest disease due to skewed X-inactivation. If X-inactivation is skewed such that the X chromosome lacking a pathogenic variant is disproportionately inactivated, the chromosome with the pathogenic variant will be preferentially active and expressed at a higher level than the wild-type gene. Skewed X-inactivation can result in phenotypic manifestations that may be present and/or more severe than anticipated. X-linked sideroblastic anemia is another example of this phenomenon.

Although several traits affecting males, such as azoospermia, have been linked to variants on the Y chromosome, there are no confirmed examples of other types of Y-linked diseases.

For example, in patients with clinical findings consistent with cystic fibrosis, in the absence of two pathogenic variants in the <em>CFTR</em> gene, a diagnosis can alternatively be established by demonstrating dysfunction of the corresponding protein, either by a positive sweat chloride test or abnormal nasal potential difference. In the era of modulator therapies, establishing a diagnosis is a priority, as patients with only one modulator-responsive pathogenic variant are eligible for therapy.

Penetrance is a probability estimate that ranges from 0 to 1. Some diseases have very high (or full) penetrance, whereas others demonstrate more variable penetrance rates. Penetrance can also be used to describe alleles in the context of complex diseases, but other expressions of risk, such as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), or population attributable risk (PAR), are more commonly used.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Full penetrance</strong> – Genes with penetrance values of 1 are considered fully penetrant. In these cases, the genotype status perfectly predicts the development of disease and can be reliably used for genetic counseling (although genotype may not precisely predict other disease features such as the age of onset or disease severity). Classic examples include autosomal dominant (AD) Huntington disease, in which all individuals with a pathogenic variant (the presence of more than 40 CAG repeats in the huntingtin [<em>HTT</em>] gene) will eventually manifest the disease. Another example is biallelic inheritance of the 1278insTATC frameshift variant in the hexosaminidase A (<em>HEXA</em>) gene in AR infantile Tay-Sachs disease [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].

When penetrance is incomplete but high (values of 0.8 to 0.9), the disease will appear to be Mendelian but may occasionally skip a generation, such that an obligatory carrier of a causative genotype does not manifest the features of the disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79882" href="/z/d/graphic/79882.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>); this is most typically observed for conditions with AD inheritance.

For example, the lifetime prevalence of developing breast cancer among female carriers of pathogenic variants in <em>BRCA1</em> is typically estimated at 60 to 80 percent [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]; however, lower rates (&lt;40 percent) have been reported in selected families [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Striking differences, not thought to be due to differences in variant frequency, have been reported in the annual incidence of breast cancer in individuals with pathogenic variants in <em>BRCA1</em> between North America (72 percent) and Poland (49 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3091344985"><span class="h3">Variable expressivity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast with penetrance, which describes the probability that a disease will manifest with a disease-causing genotype, variable expressivity refers to phenotypic differences in the degree or spectrum of disease manifestation in individuals with the disease. </p><p>Variability is the norm among genetic diseases and is particularly common for disorders that affect multiple organ systems. As an example, in cystic fibrosis there is significant variability in the degree of pancreatic dysfunction and lung function decline among individuals who are homozygous for the F508del <em>CFTR</em> variant, even among siblings and twin pairs [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Variable expressivity differs from pleiotropy, which refers to clinical manifestations in multiple tissues or organs in association with disease-causing variants in a single gene.

Age-related penetrance can be caused by cumulative rates of cellular damage that occur because additional gene changes accumulate over time until a disease-causing threshold is attained. Selected examples include the <em>BRCA1</em> gene and breast cancer, <em>C9ORF72</em> and <em>SOD1</em> genes and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the myocilin (<em>MYOC</em>) gene and primary open-angle glaucoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Allelic heterogeneity</strong> – Allelic heterogeneity (the presence of multiple, different disease-causing sequence variants in a gene) is a common cause of variable penetrance and variable expressivity. Not all gene variants have the same phenotypic impact. Variants that induce more deleterious changes in protein structure (ie, nonsense or frameshift mutations that cause loss of function) or those affecting critical positions or structural motifs (eg, in highly conserved functional motifs) in the protein can induce more significant functional consequences than more milder forms of variation, such as gene variants that lead to the substitution of amino acids with similar size, charge, and polarity. This phenomenon has been documented for many conditions, including pathogenic variants in <em>SOD1</em> in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pathogenic variants in <em>CFTR</em> in cystic fibrosis, and several beta globin gene (<em>HBB</em>) variants in beta thalassemia [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. Allelic heterogeneity plays an important role in most genetic diseases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic heterogeneity</strong> – For diseases or traits in which variants in more than one gene can cause the same condition, the penetrance and expressivity typically vary. As an example, the various subtypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type I (A through E) are caused by pathogenic variants affecting four different genes (<em>PMP22</em> for types 1A and 1E, <em>MPZ</em> for type 1B, <em>LITAF</em> for type 1C, and <em>EGR2</em> for type 1D). Although the spectrum of manifestations is clinically indistinguishable for some forms of CMT (types 1A and 1C), marked differences in age of onset, rate of progression, patterns of nerve involvement, and severity of conduction abnormalities are typically observed between other CMT types. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6220.html" rel="external">"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic modifiers</strong> – Genetic modifiers are sequence variants, most commonly in a different gene, that alter the penetrance or expressivity of a pathogenic variant, but do not cause disease in the absence of the variant. For example, the penetrance of pathogenic variants in <em>DFNB26</em> that cause AR nonsyndromic deafness is markedly reduced among carriers of a putative modifier gene, <em>DFNM1</em> [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. As another example, lung function in cystic fibrosis is highly variable, even among individuals with identical genotypes. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified several candidate modifier loci, including common variants in the <em>TGFB1</em> and <em>IFRD1</em> genes [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Environmental exposures</strong> – The effect of environmental exposures on the phenotype of genetic disease (both for monogenic and complex diseases) has been recognized since the early days of medical genetics. Phenylketonuria is caused by loss-of-function variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<em>PAH</em>) gene and results in cognitive deficits due to accumulation of phenylalanine in the brain. Restricting the dietary intake of phenylalanine prevents its accumulation in the central nervous system, enabling normal cognitive development in individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in <em>PAH</em> [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. This is an example of a predictable environmental modification through substrate manipulation in a metabolic pathway.

As an example, exposure to cigarette smoke greatly increases the likelihood and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema among individuals who are homozygous for pathogenic variants in the <em>SERPINA1</em> gene.

Parental imprinting is thought to arise through epigenetic modification of DNA that takes place in the ova and sperm during gametogenesis, before fertilization. Genes that are inactivated (silenced) in the female line are said to be maternally imprinted and only the paternally derived allele is expressed and active. Genes that are inactivated (silenced) in the male line are said to be paternally imprinted and only the maternally derived allele is expressed and active  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54712" href="/z/d/graphic/54712.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>).</p><p>A well-characterized imprinted locus is the 15q11 gene cluster.

Prader-Willi syndrome (OMIM #176270) results from deletions, absence, or abnormal imprinting of paternally inherited genes in this cluster (eg, <em>SNRPN</em> and <em>NDN</em>). These genes are silenced when inherited from the mother, and disease phenotypes manifest when deletions occur on paternally inherited chromosomes. By contrast, Angelman syndrome (OMIM #105830) can result from deletions of a set of adjacent maternally inherited genes that include <em>UBE3A</em>; these genes are silenced when paternally inherited, and similar deletions on paternally inherited chromosomes do not produce the disease phenotype. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16648.html" rel="external">"Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)", section on '15q11-13 paternal deletion syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16648.html" rel="external">"Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)", section on '15q11-13 maternal deletion syndrome (Angelman syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p>Relatively few confirmed examples of parental imprinting with direct clinical application besides the 15q11 region have been described. However, it is possible that such epigenetic processes will prove to be important disease modifiers. Databases of imprinted genes are available from Geneimprint (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geneimprint.com%2F&amp;token=F%2F33Yq3Lpx4WKgz%2BcwHiE02JZUyv0lGm7w%2FNqDYPfn71PsdbE%2Ber2wZr%2FMDDVZvF&amp;TOPIC_ID=2897" target="_blank">https://www.geneimprint.com/</a>). These include entries related to neuropsychiatric illnesses including alcoholism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism; diabetes; and asthma. Unlike the 15q11 locus, most of the findings have not been replicated in multiple patient populations, and the extent to which imprinting influences other traits remains unclear.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2780908354"><span class="h2">Mitochondrial inheritance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mitochondrial inheritance refers to traits that are due to genetic variation in the mitochondrial DNA, also referred to as the mitochondrial genome, rather than the nuclear genome. Mitochondria are organelles present in most somatic cells; numerous mitochondria are present in the cytoplasm. Mitochondria possess a circular strand of DNA that is separate from the cell's nuclear genome or nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA contains 37 genes that encode proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs), and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), all contained in a 16.6 kb circular DNA fragment that replicates autonomously  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73757" href="/z/d/graphic/73757.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>).</p><p>Human mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively through the maternal line (from the egg), as mitochondria from sperm are not contributed during fertilization [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Thus, genetic disorders caused by pathogenic variants in mitochondrial genes exhibit exclusive maternal inheritance, although some individuals may be phenotypically unaffected  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73424" href="/z/d/graphic/73424.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). Offspring of affected fathers do not inherit these diseases. </p><p>Many of the proteins vital for mitochondrial function are encoded by nuclear DNA (on chromosomes) rather than by the mitochondrial genome. Pathogenic variants that disrupt the function for these genes follow Mendelian inheritance patterns despite interfering with mitochondrial function(s). </p><p>Individuals with pathogenic variants in mitochondrial genes commonly exhibit heteroplasmy, in which there is more than one type of mitochondria in every cell, with some affected and some unaffected by the pathogenic variant in the mitochondrial DNA. Females with a mitochondrial variant who exhibit heteroplasmy will pass on varying numbers of affected or unaffected mitochondria in their eggs, meaning that there can be substantial variation in the contribution of the mitochondrial variant (and thus the likelihood of disease development and/or disease severity) in each offspring.</p><p>A human mitochondrial DNA database is available (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mitomap.org%2F&amp;token=l79bgTJaoAltP1TadK9WICccZBzGMcYK%2FrdeGVW2Pvg%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=2897" target="_blank">www.mitomap.org</a>); this lists mitochondrial gene variants confirmed as pathogenic by two or more laboratories.

Many of the diseases with reports of digenic inheritance typically also exhibit classic AR inheritance patterns. When digenic inheritance is observed, one of the two loci is usually the same gene as implicated in the AR form (though with different alleles). As an example, a digenic form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP; OMIM #268000) has been described (type 7), resulting from the combination of specific heterozygous variants in both the <em>PRPH2</em> (also known as RDS) and <em>ROM1</em> genes [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Consistent with digenic inheritance, the presence of heterozygosity for pathogenic <em>ROM1</em> variants in the absence of pathogenic <em>PRPH2</em> variants does not result in RP. It is also noteworthy that the spectrum of <em>PRPH2</em> variants includes several that cause AD RP alone and others that cause macular dystrophy. Thus, the <em>PRPH2</em> gene is an example of a gene demonstrating allelic heterogeneity (a cause of variable penetrance and expressivity), digenic inheritance, and pleiotropy. (See <a class="local">'Causes of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pleiotropy'</a> above.)</p><p>Another example of digenic inheritance is Usher syndrome, classically characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and early-onset RP. Though most commonly presenting as an AR disease caused by pathogenic variants in <em>CDH23</em> and other genes, some patients have been described with only one <em>CDH23</em> variant in combination with a second severe, pathogenic variant in <em>PCDH15</em> [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

Triallelic inheritance illustrates the effects of gene dosage and represents a bridge between monogenic and multifactorial traits.</p><p>An example is Bardet-Biedl syndrome (OMIM #209900), in which most affected individuals are homozygous or compound heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in one gene, consistent with AR inheritance. However, families with Bardet-Biedl syndrome have been described in which three variants in two genes segregate with the disease phenotype, and family members with two of the three variants are unaffected [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>], although this situation is rare and triallelic inheritance in Bardet-Biedl syndrome has been considered by some researchers to be controversial.</p><p>There are also situations where the occurrence of two or more pathogenic variants has been hypothesized to explain more severe disease presentations. An example of this has been reported in a family with short telomere syndrome, in which a severely affected brother was homozygous for a variant in the <em>TERT </em>gene of intermediate functional impact (p.Lys1050Asn) and was also a carrier for a third, deleterious variant in <em>TERC </em>[<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Mendelian disorders are highly penetrant monogenic diseases in which the correlation between genotype and phenotype is strong. These are often rare disorders. Mendelian inheritance refers to the expression of the phenotype rather than the genotype. Recognition of Mendelian inheritance requires a detailed family history and thorough review of pedigree information (often from a three-generation pedigree). (See <a class="local">'Genetic basis of monogenic inheritance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Typical Mendelian inheritance patterns</strong> – The five typical patterns of Mendelian inheritance are autosomal dominant (AD)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110421" href="/z/d/graphic/110421.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63306" href="/z/d/graphic/63306.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), autosomal recessive (AR)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110582" href="/z/d/graphic/110582.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50124" href="/z/d/graphic/50124.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), X-linked dominant  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75137" href="/z/d/graphic/75137.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>), X-linked recessive  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55180" href="/z/d/graphic/55180.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>), and Y-linked  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69653" href="/z/d/graphic/69653.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>).

Variable penetrance refers to variation in penetrance levels in different families. Variable expressivity refers to different clinical presentations of the same disease (variation in phenotype, such as which organ systems are affected) in different family members with the same genotype. Modifiers of penetrance and expressivity include age, allelic heterogeneity, genetic (locus) heterogeneity, modifier genes, and environmental exposures. (See <a class="local">'Penetrance and expressivity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Pleiotropy</strong> – Pleiotropy refers to production of multiple phenotypic effects, often in different tissues or organs, from variants in a single gene.
