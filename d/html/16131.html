Accelerated schedules include "rush" and "ultra-rush."</p><p>This topic review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of rush and ultra-rush schedules for VIT, indications for accelerated VIT, and provide several specific examples of protocols that have been used successfully. Conventional schedules for VIT are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4096.html" rel="external">"Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4092.html" rel="external">"Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2228032471"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2100288498"><span class="h2">Phases of immunotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All forms of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) are divided into two phases: build-up and maintenance.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The build-up phase involves serial injections of increasing amounts of allergen, during which tolerance to the allergen is gradually induced and the patient's immune response to the allergen is modified from a T helper type 2 (Th2) phenotype to a T helper type 1 (Th1) phenotype [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In conventional VIT schedules, the build-up phase involves one or three injections per week and extends from 8 to 21 weeks. Conventional schedules for VIT are shown in the tables (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51030" href="/d/graphic/51030.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64856" href="/d/graphic/64856.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Th2 and Th1 immune responses are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3980.html" rel="external">"The adaptive cellular immune response: T cells and cytokines", section on 'Cytokine profiles and functions of CD4+ T helper cell subsets'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The maintenance phase of allergen immunotherapy involves ongoing injections of an immunizing dose of allergen, usually at intervals of three to six weeks. During the maintenance phase, the immune transformation becomes complete. This phase is usually extended for a period of three to five years because shorter durations of treatment are associated with higher rates of recurrent systemic allergic reactions to subsequent stings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4089.html" rel="external">"Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Determining duration of therapy", section on 'Minimal duration of treatment'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Accelerated protocols for VIT are categorized as either rush or ultra-rush schedules, although these terms have not been strictly defined. Accelerated schedules of immunotherapy involve shortening the length of the build-up phase, while the maintenance phase remains the same. The length of the build-up phase depends upon the frequency of the injections and the incremental dose increase between consecutive injections. Thus, accelerated schedules either involve administering more injections per visit, increasing the dose more between consecutive injections, or both. The mechanisms of allergen immunotherapy are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/362.html" rel="external">"Allergen immunotherapy for allergic disease: Therapeutic mechanisms"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1663121308"><span class="h2">Variability in terminology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terms "rush" and "ultra rush" are used variably in the literature and are therefore ambiguous. Each term has been applied to several different accelerated schedules. We prefer instead to refer to different protocols by the duration of the accelerated schedule and the number of injections given. For example, a rush schedule that takes two days to complete with nine injections is referred to as "two-day rush with nine injections."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6515476"><span class="h3">Rush</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rush VIT schedules involve administering the build-up phase over a period of days, until the maintenance dose is achieved (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80931" href="/d/graphic/80931.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The maintenance dose is then given at one-week intervals for two doses, then two-week intervals for two doses, then three-week intervals for two doses, and then monthly thereafter.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13460684"><span class="h3">Ultra-rush</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As mentioned above, ultra-rush VIT uses a more rapid build-up phase. The final dose on the first day is typically slightly lower than the full maintenance dose, although the patient has received a cumulative dose of allergen close to the 100 mcg maintenance dose of an individual venom (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62051" href="/d/graphic/62051.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. On the next scheduled visit, the patient usually receives a full maintenance dose, which is repeated monthly thereafter. Compared with rush schedules, ultra-rush schedules expose the patient to a lower cumulative dose of venom during the build-up phase.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7152403"><span class="h1">ADVANTAGES AND SAFETY OF ACCELERATED IMMUNOTHERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6515795"><span class="h2">Advantages</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Advantages of accelerated VIT include increased patient convenience and more rapid induction of clinical protection from future stings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Greater convenience</strong> – Inconvenience is the most common reason patients discontinue conventional immunotherapy. Accelerated schedules involve fewer office visits and are favored by many patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>More rapid onset of clinical benefit</strong> – Accelerated schedules induce the immunologic changes that occur during the build-up phase more rapidly than conventional schedules. Thus, patients achieve clinical protection sooner. In most patients, protection from recurrent systemic allergic reactions appears to be established within one week of reaching maintenance doses and may improve further with time [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In a study of the ultra-rush protocol mentioned above, two patients with severe past reactions were restung 7 to 15 days after desensitization and developed only local erythema [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, significant increases in venom-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) were noted 15 days after reaching maintenance. The immunologic changes induced by immunotherapy are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/362.html" rel="external">"Allergen immunotherapy for allergic disease: Therapeutic mechanisms", section on '"Blocking" IgG4'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reduced risk of dosing errors</strong> – Dosing errors are one of the leading causes of systemic allergic reactions during subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Accelerated schedules involve fewer doses during the build-up phase, and these doses are administered over a more concentrated time period, so dosing errors are reduced.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Improved safety</strong> – Accelerated schedules for VIT usually have lower rates of systemic allergic reactions to the immunotherapy injections, compared with slower, conventional schedules. Note that this has been demonstrated in accelerated forms of VIT but does not appear to be the case with accelerated forms of aeroallergen immunotherapy. The reasons for this difference are not known. (See <a class="local">'Rates of systemic allergic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7152425"><span class="h2">Safety</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Accelerated VIT schedules were designed to be performed in the outpatient setting under the supervision of an experienced allergist and nursing staff. There are no data to suggest that patients should routinely be hospitalized to undergo accelerated VIT. However, patients should be screened appropriately before any form of SCIT is considered. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p>Among the different Hymenoptera venoms, honey bee is the most likely to induce a systemic allergic reaction in both conventional and accelerated VIT schedules [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. As an example, in a report of patients treated with a four-day rush protocol, systemic allergic reactions occurred in 12 percent of subjects receiving honey bee venom (although no patients required <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>) compared with 2 percent of those receiving yellow jacket venom [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5916092"><span class="h3">Rates of systemic allergic reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both rush and ultra-rush schedules for VIT usually demonstrate similar or lower rates of systemic allergic reactions during the build-up phase, compared with conventional schedules [<a href="#rid4">4,7-12</a>]. This reduced rate of reactions has been attributed to the use of fewer injections and lower cumulative doses of venom [<a href="#rid9">9,13</a>]. The specific rate depends upon the schedule used. As with conventional VIT, honey bee VIT is associated with higher rates of systemic reactions. (See <a class="local">'Specific protocols'</a> below.)</p><p>The relationship between systemic reactions, injection number, and cumulative venom dose has been demonstrated in several studies [<a href="#rid9">9,14,15</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one report, 284 subjects underwent either a four-day, six-hour, or 210-minute VIT schedule, and systemic reactions occurred in 28, 29, and 7 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another report, 129 patients underwent a 210-minute VIT schedule. One hundred fourteen (88 percent) reached maintenance in 210 minutes. Systemic reactions occurred in 22 percent but 71 percent of those were mild, and there were no severe reactions. Systemic reactions were more common in those receiving honey bee VIT and patients with a previous severe systemic reaction [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A randomized trial of 76 patients compared VIT using an ultra-rush protocol with a rush protocol and with a slow protocol [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Systemic reactions occurred in 1.9 percent, 3.7 percent, and 3.9 percent of patients, respectively, during the build-up phase, and in 0.99, 1.46, and 2.7 percent, respectively, during the maintenance phase. Reactions to subsequent stings did not differ among groups (1.1 percent, 1.2 percent, and 1.1 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 31 patients with bee allergy and 82 with wasp allergy looked at systemic reactions during the build-up using ultra-rush, rush, and conventional protocols [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Systemic reactions occurred in 13.7, 14.3, and 26.5 percent of patients for ultra-rush, rush, and conventional VIT, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective study of 143 patients with allergy to honey bee or wasp, patients were treated either with a half-day, three-day, or three-week protocol [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Systemic reactions occurred with honey bee VIT in 15.8 percent of the half-day rush patients, 8.7 percent of the three-day, and 25 percent of the three-week patients. Reactions with wasp occurred in 6.1 percent of the half-day rush patients, none of the three-day, and 12.5 percent of the three-week patients. Significant differences were found for higher reaction rates for honey bee and for the three-week protocol [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p>To determine whether the safety of accelerated venom schedules differed between adults and children, systemic reaction rates during VIT in 71 children (7 to 17 years) were compared with those in 981 adults. Bee-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) was higher and tryptase was lower in the children when compared with the adults. The rate of systemic reactions was higher in children than adults (6.9 versus 2.5 percent). In addition, a five-day protocol was associated with an increased risk of systemic reaction compared with a three-day protocol (odds ratio [OR] = 2.65) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. A similar increase in systemic reactions in very young children has been noted in accelerated immunotherapy with aeroallergens. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13526.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous aeroallergen immunotherapy: Accelerated schedules (cluster and rush)", section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2888285814"><span class="h4">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors for the development of systemic reactions during accelerated VIT have not been extensively investigated. One study of 175 patients treated with a three-day rush VIT protocol reported a rate of systemic reactions of 10.9 percent [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Independent predictors of systemic allergic reactions included the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, female sex, and receiving honey bee venom (versus other venoms). The safety of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients receiving immunotherapy is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/394.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy", section on 'Factors associated with fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3812724277"><span class="h3">High-risk patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The authors prefer the use of rush VIT in higher-risk patients, such as those with cardiopulmonary comorbidities or those taking certain medications, and some data exist to support this practice. In a study of 64 patients (ages 5 to 70 years) who had at least one of several conditions (ie, cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled asthma, elevated baseline tryptase) or who were taking beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors, subjects were treated with either rush or conventional VIT [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The rate of systemic reactions was similar in both groups (25.7 versus 27.5 percent), while the rate of reactions per injection was higher in the conventional group (5.6 versus 2.7 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4095260453"><span class="h3">VIT with ant extracts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rate of systemic reactions for accelerated schedules with ant whole body extract (WBE) is less defined than it is for purified venoms. In a study of 20 children treated with rush immunotherapy using WBE of <em>Solenopsis invicta, </em>there were six systemic reactions out of 324 injections, all of which were mild (grades 1 or 2)<em> </em>[<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The risk of a reaction did not correlate with age, sex, atopy, or serum levels of ant-specific IgE.</p><p>An Australian study evaluated patients receiving immunotherapy for jack jumper ant hypersensitivity, which also uses whole body extract rather than purified venom. Still, this study compared the incidence of systemic reactions between a 3-visit and 10-visit schedule of venom immunotherapy (VIT) in 93 subjects sensitive to jack jumper ant (<em>Myrmecia pilosula</em>) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Although the shorter schedule required fewer injections, it was associated with a higher rate of reactions (12 percent) compared with the slower schedule (no systemic reactions).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7152468"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) of any type are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/361.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: Indications and efficacy", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>It is our approach to use accelerated schedules for VIT in preference to conventional schedules, since protection from future stings can be achieved with no increase in treatment-related risk. VIT practice parameters state that safe and effective accelerated schedules have been published and are no longer considered experimental [<a href="#rid8">8,23</a>].</p><p>Other specific indications for an accelerated VIT schedule include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A desire by the patient to minimize the number of visits for treatment, either because of the patient's schedule or the distance that the patient lives from the treatment facility.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The inability to tolerate conventional VIT. Occasionally, accelerated VIT is used to achieve maintenance in patients who do not tolerate conventional build-up due to recurrent systemic reactions in response to the injections [<a href="#rid3">3,12</a>].</p><p></p><p>The literature describes the performance of accelerated VIT in children as young as two years of age [<a href="#rid13">13,24</a>]. In older children, maturity level and the ability to cooperate with the repeated injections required should be considered.</p><p>In theory, patients with mast cell disorders (eg, systemic mastocytosis or monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome) might tolerate accelerated VIT schedules better than traditional schedules, although this issue has not been formally studied.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24581499"><span class="h2">Cost</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cost of an accelerated protocol varies by the length of the procedure and number of injections given. Accelerated protocols involve fewer injections and less venom but more staff contact time. At one of the author's (JP) institution, the cost of accelerated and conventional VIT are similar.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7152475"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Contraindications to accelerated VIT are the same as those for conventional VIT, since the safety is comparable or better. Patients with asthma should have their symptoms under good control prior to beginning any form of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT).</p><p>Relative contraindications include medical conditions that would impair the patient's ability to survive anaphylaxis or treatment for anaphylaxis (eg, cardiovascular disease and severe chronic pulmonary diseases). However, in patients with venom allergy, cardiopulmonary disorders also put the patient at risk for a fatal outcome from a future sting, so each patient's situation must be considered individually. The issue of comorbidities, as well as in the use of beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients needing VIT, are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/394.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy", section on 'Factors associated with fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4090.html" rel="external">"Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action", section on 'Patients requiring ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7152482"><span class="h1">CONSENT, STAFFING, AND EQUIPMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following recommendations about staffing, equipment, and consent are based upon the authors' clinical experience with administering rush VIT protocols over a period of 15 to 20 years.

Mild systemic reactions were observed in one and seven patients in the H1 and placebo groups, respectively. The addition of the H2 antihistamine did not provide additional protection. Local reactions were reduced in the groups receiving either H1 or combination premedication. Two other randomized trials reached similar conclusions [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. However, H1 antihistamines did not appear to prevent serious systemic reactions (eg, hypotension) in any of these studies, although the incidence of such reactions was low.</p><p>At least one study also suggested that antihistamine premedication improves the efficacy of VIT [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>The authors' practice is to begin accelerated VIT as soon as the diagnosis of venom allergy is made (ie, usually on the same day that the patient is skin tested) to avoid the risk of future stings. Whenever possible, we administer an H1 antihistamine prior to the start of the procedure. We typically give a second-generation nonsedating agent, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9236" href="/d/drug information/9236.html" rel="external">cetirizine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9572" href="/d/drug information/9572.html" rel="external">loratadine</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8445" href="/d/drug information/8445.html" rel="external">fexofenadine</a>, at standard age-appropriate doses. However, it is our experience that patients tolerate the accelerated schedule even without premedication. Thus, if it is practical to pretreat with an H1 antihistamine prior to starting the accelerated VIT schedule, then we suggest doing so because there may be some benefit as outlined in the above studies. However, this is not required in the practice parameters and should not otherwise delay administration of immunotherapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>A more extensive premedication regimen (such as is used with accelerated aeroallergen immunotherapy) is unnecessary, based on the practice parameters [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and further delays the administration of VIT.</p><p>The addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> and H2 antihistamines to H1 antihistamines appears to be more important for imported fire ant whole body extract (WBE) than for purified Hymenoptera venoms because the frequency of systemic reactions without premedication in patients receiving accelerated WBE immunotherapy is higher, at least based on one study of a one-day protocol. In that study, patients received either no premedication or three days of prednisone and H1 and H2 blockers [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].

Patients with mild-to-moderate reactions that respond promptly and completely to treatment can usually be observed in the clinic for two hours and discharged to home. However, it may be more appropriate to hospitalize a patient with a more severe reaction or with symptoms that do not respond promptly to treatment. Likewise, patients who live far from medical care or have little home support may be better served by hospitalization. There is a risk of biphasic reactions with anaphylaxis from any cause, and the risk factors for recurrent symptoms are unclear, although these have rarely been reported in the rush immunotherapy literature. Deciding on the best immediate aftercare for a patient with a systemic reaction requires clinical judgement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/396.html" rel="external">"Biphasic and protracted anaphylaxis", section on 'Possible risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The patient should then return at the next scheduled day based on the individual protocol (most commonly in one week) to resume injections. The authors believe it important <strong>not</strong> to extend this time period by even a few days, as it is their observation that patients who wait longer than one week tend to experience more systemic reactions in the remaining build-up. The authors resume treatment with the dose that caused the reaction. There is no utility based on the available literature for continuing antihistamine medications during the maintenance phase of therapy.</p><p>Another study evaluated 65 patients who experienced anaphylaxis during the initial build-up with a three-day (modified from the two-day protocol in [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]) VIT rush protocol, who were kept at a lower maintenance dose for 14 weeks and then later built up to the usual maintenance dose [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].
