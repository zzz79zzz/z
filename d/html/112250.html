         Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition with an estimated global prevalence of almost 12 percent in adults over age 30 years [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, COPD was the third leading cause of death worldwide [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients with less severe COPD, symptoms and exacerbations can be controlled with interventions such as smoking cessation, vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal infections, pulmonary rehabilitation, and one or more inhaled medications (ie, bronchodilators and glucocorticoids). As the disease progresses, COPD symptoms and exacerbations may be persistent despite these interventions. While refractory COPD has not been formally defined, the context for this diagnostic category is patients with severe, persistent symptoms or frequent exacerbations despite appropriate care.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management of refractory COPD will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of nonrefractory COPD and of COPD exacerbations are discussed separately. (See

         Some patients with COPD continue to have refractory dyspnea and limitations to activity. Others may have continued cough and sputum or recurring exacerbations despite therapy with long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA, also known as a long-acting anticholinergic agent), long-acting beta-agonist (LABA), and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS; aka inhaled glucocorticoid) therapies. In addition to pulmonary symptoms, these patients may also report fatigue, weight loss, sleep disturbance, and anorexia.

        <p>
         Given their high burden of disease and frequent contributing comorbidities, patients with refractory COPD benefit from a comprehensive reassessment of their symptoms and disease burden, as outlined below.

         The Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report uses the core metrics of quantified dyspnea/health status and frequency and severity of exacerbations to categorize patients for both initial and follow-up management [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. We continue to find it helpful in refractory patients to evaluate dyspnea and exercise tolerance using validated instruments, such as the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale (

         ]. To assess for interval exacerbation history, we ask patients about periods of increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence, as well as any treatments with antibiotics or oral glucocorticoids for respiratory symptoms. COPD hospitalizations mark severe exacerbations. We also monitor symptoms commonly associated with COPD, such as fatigue and sleep disturbance. For patients we are evaluating for the first time, we also review smoking history, other exposure history, and prior pulmonary function testing (if available) to ensure that patients appropriately carry the diagnosis of COPD. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1455.html" rel="external">
          "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Diagnosis and staging"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         On physical examination, we assess for use of the accessory respiratory muscles of the neck and shoulder girdle, expiration through pursed lips, cyanosis, asterixis due to severe hypercapnia, and liver enlargement/tenderness or peripheral edema due to right heart failure. A falling body mass index (BMI) is common in severe COPD, but a rising BMI may suggest fluid retention due to right heart failure or comorbid heart failure. If present, decreased mental status could reflect hypercapnia or hypoxemia. Other physical findings, such as digital clubbing, bibasilar fine crackles, and peripheral edema, might suggest a comorbidity or alternate diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who primarily report ongoing dyspnea have fewer additional pharmacologic options beyond inhaled therapies but may benefit from invasive approaches and palliative symptom management. In addition, reevaluation for alternative diagnoses, consideration for further pulmonary rehabilitation, and assessment of ongoing home exercise is essential. (See
         <a class="local">
          'For patients with persistent dyspnea without exacerbations'

        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, patients with frequent exacerbations are more likely to benefit from add-on oral pharmacologic therapies. (See

         It must be noted that patients may change their disease pattern over time, so therapeutic approaches may need to shift in order to remain tailored to individual patient needs.

         </span>
         For patients who have persistent symptoms despite optimized inhaled therapies (LAMA and LABA, with or without ICS), it is critical to review patient inhaler technique, adherence to inhaler therapy, and any adverse effects the patient may be experiencing. This information may prompt changes in inhaled agents used, device type (eg, pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) versus dry powder inhaler (DPI) versus soft mist inhaler (SMI) or nebulizer), or dosing schedule to address these concerns. Inhaler device education and reeducation is essential to successful pharmacologic therapy and should always be considered before other changes in therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120326.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review of studies of inhaler technique found that on average two-thirds of patients with asthma or COPD made one or more errors in device use [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         Adherence to COPD medication regimens is frequently suboptimal, and lower adherence is associated with more frequent hospitalization and greater overall cost [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>

          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An initial step to assess adherence is asking whether a patient can identify their inhalers from a list or image  (

         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Barriers to adherence should be explored, including complex regimens, lack of confidence about technique, lack of access to medications or expense, stress, depression, and adverse effects [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-16

         Inhaler technique can be challenging, especially as the techniques for using pMDIs, DPIs, and SMIs are quite different. Inhaler technique should be taught to all patients by demonstration to the patient and then return demonstration by the patient. The patient’s technique should be reviewed regularly to ensure optimal medication delivery. Techniques for using various inhalers can be found in the tables and are also discussed in greater detail separately  (

         For patients who are unable to achieve adequate technique despite a trial of different devices and a valved holding chamber for metered dose inhalers, an alternative option may be to switch to maintenance long-acting nebulized medications (eg,

         Some patients may also be able to perform proper technique in the office, but not when they are at the nadir of their dosing or having a mild exacerbation. These patients may benefit from short-acting nebulizers (

         There are minimal head-to-head data that directly compare one LABA with another, one LAMA with another, or one ICS with another. Therefore, other differences between inhalers, including patient preference, drive agent selection.

          Delivery mechanism
         </strong>
         – Medication optimization should take into account variations in medication delivery based on the patient’s ability to use the various inhaler devices. While patients are usually familiar with pMDIs, which they use as rescue inhalers, they may have problems with pMDI delivery, especially with hand-breath coordination. The use of a spacer or valved holding chamber can increase the bioavailability of the medication and reduce the need for hand-breath coordination but still requires patient training on proper technique.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         DPIs have the advantage of being breath-actuated and thus less subject to problems with actuation-inhalation coordination. On the other hand, DPIs require a threshold inspiratory flow, which patients with advanced COPD may be unable to generate. Alternative choices that are less dependent on inspiratory flow include pMDIs and SMIs.

          Regimen simplicity
         </strong>
         – For many patients, complex inhaler regimens contribute to mistakes and poor adherence. Frequent problems include misidentification of controller therapies as rescue therapies and omission of nocturnal doses. We prefer to simplify inhaler regimens as much as possible, with once or twice daily single-inhaler triple therapy with LABA, LAMA, and ICS for most patients with refractory disease. The most frequent problems with this approach are insurance approval and poor patient inspiratory flow for activation of DPIs, as covered above.

          Cost and availability
         </strong>
         – Due to their status as pharmaceuticals and devices, inhaled medications often remain expensive even off-patent; shortages of certain devices or doses are also common. Prohibitive costs are a frequent contributor to poor patient adherence, but patients are sometimes embarrassed to report these issues to their physicians. Working with the patient's insurance carrier, pharmacist, and pharmaceutical company prescription assistance programs can help determine the most affordable options. In the United States, nebulized medications are sometimes covered under Medicare part B rather than part D; the added complexity of nebulized regimens must be weighed against the decrease in cost that can be derived from this approach.

         After optimization of the inhaled therapeutic regimen and medication adherence, patients with refractory symptoms of COPD should undergo CT evaluation to assess for comorbid conditions and new disease processes. Possible findings include new interstitial lung disease, new lung cancer, evidence of pulmonary edema, indirect evidence of pulmonary hypertension, central airway obstruction, bronchiectasis, or bronchiolitis. Patients who continue to smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years generally qualify for CT screening for lung cancer. (See

         Among patients with COPD, multiple comorbid or concomitant disease processes can contribute to dyspnea and exercise intolerance, including asthma, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, environmental allergies, coronary heart disease, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic nasal/sinus disease, dysphagia or aspiration, immunodeficiency, sleep-disordered breathing, anxiety and depression, and cognitive impairment.

         For patients without other indications based on history and physical examination, we routinely obtain chest imaging with CT and echocardiogram, as discussed above.

         ]. Patients with any current or historical diagnosis of asthma or asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) were excluded. Despite lower exacerbation rates than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dupilumab therapy resulted in reduced exacerbation rates (0.78 per patient/year with dupilumab versus 1.10 per patient/year with placebo; rate ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.58-0.86). There were also modest improvements in airway obstruction after 52 weeks (prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV

Symptoms clinically improved in the dupilumab group at slightly higher rates than in the placebo group (St. George respiratory questionnaire improvement ≥4 at week 52 in 52 versus 43 percent [odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9]). Adverse events were similar or lower in the dupilumab arm; for example, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 0.9 percent of the patients in the dupilumab group and in 1.9 percent of those in the placebo group.

         These results show a larger and more consistent effect than those seen in trials of anti-IL-5 therapies in COPD. Whether this is due to a larger benefit of targeting the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways or more stringent selection criteria (patients with higher eosinophil levels) in the BOREAS trial remains to be determined. Further work on biologic therapies may expand the indications and therapeutic agents available for patients with refractory COPD. (See

         Patients with refractory COPD who experience persistent dyspnea without frequent exacerbations are often good candidates for nonpharmacologic interventions, including evaluation and treatment of comorbidities, pulmonary rehabilitation, bronchoscopic or surgical lung volume reduction, lung transplantation, and palliative therapies. For those who do not want, do not qualify for, or are awaiting more invasive interventions, a trial of

         (dosed to trough 5 to 12 mcg/mL) may improve lung function and exercise tolerance; however, its use requires close monitoring due to the narrow therapeutic window of this agent. As part of palliative disease management, opiates can also be helpful for dyspnea in this population  (

         Patients with severe COPD frequently experience significant exertional dyspnea despite optimized inhaled therapies. This is a natural consequence of the pathophysiology of COPD which can sometimes be mitigated but rarely abolished. We engage these patients in shared decision making around the pursuit of additional therapeutic options. Some patients prefer to manage expectations and make changes to their lifestyle rather than engage in therapies that require extensive monitoring, invasive testing, or extensive interaction with the health care system. For others, dyspnea has an intolerable impact on their quality of life, and they present to specialty care specifically for additional management of this symptom.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients pursuing treatment of dyspnea, pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to be highly effective for improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance [

Dosing by level (trough 5 to 12 mcg/mL) reduces toxicity, but adverse effects can still occur within this lower therapeutic range. The use of very low levels of theophylline (1 to 5 mcg/mL) to eliminate a need for therapeutic monitoring has not been shown to be of benefit [

         in COPD can be complex and serum levels can be affected by many factors. Theophylline is metabolized in the liver, and any process that interferes with liver function can rapidly increase theophylline levels. In addition, theophylline clearance decreases with age. Many drugs can alter theophylline metabolism, including cytochrome oxidase CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors  (

         Monitoring of serum levels is essential to avoid toxicity. Peak levels correlate best with toxicity, while trough levels are important for maintaining efficacy. Trials have varied in dosing strategy, but generally aim for trough levels above 5 mcg/mL and avoidance of peak levels greater than 20 mcg/mL. We prefer to check levels near trough, aiming for the lower end of the therapeutic range (5 to 12 mcg/mL). Twice daily dosing of sustained-release tablet formulations is preferred to balance ease of use with reducing differences between peak and trough levels. Capsule formulations (eg, Theo-24) may lead to erratic absorption and "dose-dumping," so are best avoided.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We initiate therapy with dosing at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg ideal body weight per day or 300 mg daily, whichever is lower. Trough levels should initially be checked after three to five days after initiating therapy or after each dose adjustment. Dosing can be increased by 20 percent if subtherapeutic. Elevated levels in the 13 to 20 mcg/mL range require dose reduction of 10 to 20 percent; higher levels should lead to stopping therapy for one day followed by dose reduction of 25 to 30 percent. Once an appropriate serum level is achieved, subsequent measurements can be made at 6- to 12-month intervals or if the patient’s clinical status or other medications change.

         Systemic glucocorticoids have long been used to treat exacerbations in patients with COPD, but they are only rarely indicated for chronic use.

        </p>
        <p>
         Long-term systemic glucocorticoids are not recommended, even for severe COPD, because of the significant side effects and evidence of increased morbidity and mortality with this therapy [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56-58
         </a>
         ]. Ongoing glucocorticoid use commonly occurs when discontinuing systemic glucocorticoids after a COPD exacerbation is repeatedly met with recurrent symptoms. In this setting, systemic glucocorticoids should be reduced to the lowest dose possible and other causes of symptoms addressed. Objective measures of improvement (eg, spirometry, walk test) must be used to justify any ongoing therapy, as emotional and euphoric effects of systemic glucocorticoids can cloud a patient's perception of benefit.

         Physiologically, surgical excision or valve-mediated collapse of the most emphysematous lung tissue may lead to decreased hyperinflation, improvement in the mechanical function of the diaphragm and chest wall, increased expiratory airflow, increased cardiac output, and improved ventilation-perfusion matching [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63-70

         <a href="#rid71">
          71

         – Ideal candidates for lung volume reduction have dyspnea associated with significant air-trapping and hyperinflation due to emphysema, moderately (but not severely) reduced exercise capacity and gas exchange, and no cardiac or anesthetic contraindications to undergoing the procedure. Testing typically includes pulmonary function tests, a six-minute walk test, arterial blood gas, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram with measurement of pulmonary artery pressures, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

         CT imaging is critical to measure lobar volumes, determine the amount of emphysematous destruction of each lobe, exclude other important diseases like bronchiectasis, and assess nodules or other findings that may require additional evaluation. For bronchoscopic LVR via endobronchial valve placement, analysis of fissural integrity with CT imaging (eg, StratX or SeleCT) is also required.

          76,77

         and diffusing capacity (DLCO) greater than 20 percent predicted, and have minimal additional comorbid illnesses  (

         Selection criteria for endobronchial valve placement are largely similar but with some key differences that broaden the pool of potential candidates  (

          table 10

         <sub>
          1
         </sub>
         or DLCO 15 to 25 percent predicted) are better able to tolerate the procedure. Bronchoscopic techniques do not require heterogeneous distributions of emphysema or upper lobe-predominant disease; however, EBVs are physiologically more likely to be successful if the lobes with the most severe disease can be targeted. Patients must have minimal collateral circulation (ie, intact major and/or minor fissures) in the targeted lobes. Additional information on selection criteria for EBV placement is discussed elsewhere. (See

         We suggest referral of appropriate patients to a center with expertise in both LVRS and endobronchial valve placement. The most appropriate interventional approach should be guided by a multidisciplinary discussion and will depend upon physiologic and anatomic features, exercise capacity, comorbidities, and patient preference. Based on the data from relevant trials, LVRS likely has larger benefit in the best candidates but comes with higher perioperative risk. Bronchoscopic approaches are safer and available to a broader range of patients but likely provide a more modest benefit.

         One small trial (n = 59) randomized COPD patients who met all preprocedure criteria for both unilateral LVRS and EBV placement to one of the two procedures [

          78
         </a>
         ]. Although follow-up results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, physiologic outcomes were largely similar between the two groups. However, compared with patients who received EBVs, those who underwent LVRS had a greater improvement in symptoms when measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT; -7 versus -1 points; a six-point difference with 95% CI 2-9). This symptomatic benefit in LVRS patients was clinically relevant (the CAT minimal clinically important difference is 2 points). One-year safety outcomes were similar between the treatment groups. LVRS required a longer initial hospital stay, but EBV occasionally required repeat procedures. There was no perioperative (30-day) mortality in either group; a single death occurred in each arm by 12 months.

         Palliative care aims to relieve suffering at all stages of disease and is not limited to end-of-life care. For patients with advanced or refractory COPD, it is appropriate to have ongoing discussions with patients and their caregivers about their understanding of their disease and prognosis, persistent symptoms and overall symptom burden, values and preferences regarding life-prolonging therapies, and needs regarding coordination of care  (

         Patients with advanced lung disease are frequently troubled by dyspnea but are also prone to other symptoms that may benefit from palliative approaches, including cough, sputum production, anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, muscle weakness, and pain. A multidisciplinary approach is helpful to assess the presence, intensity, and functional impact of these symptoms and to help ameliorate them. The palliative care of patients with chronic lung disease and the evaluation and management of associated symptoms are discussed in more detail separately. (See

         <strong>
          Dyspnea
         </strong>
         – There are many techniques helpful for ameliorating dyspnea  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74531" href="/z/d/graphic/74531.html" rel="external">
          table 12
         </a>
         ). Exercise training, breathing techniques, and accommodation strategies are often particularly helpful in patients with advanced COPD. Selected patients with refractory dyspnea may also benefit from opioid therapy, along with careful monitoring to avoid respiratory depression and other side effects. These and other management strategies for dyspnea are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14238.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Anxiety and depression
         </strong>
         – Anxiety and depression are often intertwined with the experience of dyspnea, and attempts to characterize which symptom is the dominant or primary problem for an individual patient can be difficult. Hyperventilation from anxiety can often accentuate and occasionally overwhelm patients with dyspnea. Psychoactive agents and cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful in selected patients with anxiety or depression [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91-94
         </a>
         ]. Respiratory stimulants are not beneficial to these patients and can often accentuate dyspnea even in those with hypercapnic COPD.

         <strong>
          Cough

          Assessment of the patient with refractory COPD
         </strong>
         – Symptoms and exacerbations of COPD can usually be controlled with interventions such as smoking cessation, vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal infections, pulmonary rehabilitation, and one or more inhaled medications. In a minority of patients with COPD, symptoms and exacerbations are persistent despite these interventions. (See
         <a class="local">

         When evaluating patients with refractory symptoms, first steps include quantitative assessment of exacerbation history and symptoms and addressing smoking cessation, proper inhaler technique, and adherence to prescribed inhalers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation of dyspnea, exacerbation history, and other symptoms and signs'

         If no obvious solutions arise from this initial assessment, we routinely reevaluate air flow, lung volumes, and gas exchange, perform ambulatory pulse oximetry during a six-minute walk test, and perform arterial blood gas testing at rest. Depending on the results, further evaluation typically includes echocardiography and/or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). (See

         Common comorbidities of COPD can contribute to dyspnea and exercise intolerance, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, obesity, lung cancer, sleep-disordered breathing, anxiety, and depression. (See

         – General measures for patients with COPD include smoking cessation, physical fitness including pulmonary rehabilitation, and vaccinations against respiratory infections. Select patients with severe COPD may also benefit from supplemental oxygen, nutritional supplementation, and nocturnal noninvasive ventilatory support. (See

          Patients with dyspnea
         </strong>
         – For patients with persistent dyspnea despite optimal inhaled therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation is an appropriate first step in management. We subsequently engage in shared decision making about the patient's quality of life, current level of function, feasibility of frequent medical follow-up, and comfort with more intensive medical or interventional therapies  (
