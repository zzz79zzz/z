          Management of patients with a tracheal stent already in place
         </strong>
         – Preoperative planning and discussion with the surgical team are essential because a previously placed stent must not be dislodged or even touched during anesthetic induction and airway control. The location of the stent is determined with preoperative radiographic studies. There may be adequate space above a stent in the distal trachea, such that an endotracheal tube (ETT) can be inserted via a flexible intubating bronchoscope and positioned without touching the stent. However, if preoperative imaging reveals inadequate tracheal length such that an ETT cannot be inserted above the stent, then the best plan may be to use a supraglottic airway (SGA).

         Preparations for any tracheal surgical procedure include ensuring availability and proper function of all equipment that may be necessary during induction of anesthesia and subsequent surgical interventions. This includes an assortment of regular endotracheal tubes (ETTs), as well as wire-reinforced "armored" ETTs  (

          "Lung isolation techniques"

          "Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults"

         An endotracheal stent provides tracheal support to improve or maintain airway patency in patients with a tracheal mass, stenosis, or collapse, and sometimes to cover and protect a weakened tracheal wall [

          1
         </a>
         ]. Less commonly, placement of a stent may be necessary to occlude a tracheal laceration or fistula. Stents may be "off the shelf" items but often are customized. Before induction, the surgical team should confirm that all possible stent choices are available in the operating room. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4403.html" rel="external">

         The surgeon may deploy the stent by using a forceps via a transoral or stomal route, or through an orally inserted rigid or flexible bronchoscope [

         In selected cases it is possible to place a stent via a flexible bronchoscope with local anesthetic applied to the airway by the surgeon. Examples include expandable metal stents that can be gently and quickly deployed into position and do not need removal for sizing  (

         In some cases, the surgeon can deploy the stent while the patient is transorally ventilated via an oxygen mask, supraglottic airway (SGA), or endotracheal tube (ETT).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with a tracheostomy, manual occlusion of the tracheal stoma may be required to achieve adequate ventilation via a transoral airway device. If ventilation via the tracheal stoma becomes necessary during the procedure, a wire-reinforced "armored" ETT is selected for insertion into the stoma to minimize the risk of ETT kinking  (

          Ventilation management
         </strong>
         – Ventilation is typically controlled. In one randomized study of 64 patients undergoing airway stenting, controlled ventilation after administration of an NMBA resulted in a lower incidence of desaturation events (defined as percutaneous oxygen saturation [SpO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ] &lt;95 percent) compared with allowing spontaneous respiration (10 versus 75 percent) [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Typically, the bronchoscope and stent are inserted, then repeatedly repositioned or removed to adjust limb lengths for an optimal tracheal fit. This technique requires periods of intermittent ventilation. For critical tracheal stenosis requiring urgent or emergency stenting, ventilation strategies are individualized depending on the location (and cause) of tracheal narrowing [

         </a>
         8 to 10 mg is typically administered to reduce airway and vocal cord swelling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to emergence, a final inspection and suctioning of the trachea and bronchi to remove any secretions or blood in the airway is essential, as well as communication with the surgeon regarding their satisfaction with hemostasis and position of the stent. Residual bleeding and clot formation may compromise airway patency on emergence. Additionally, airway compromise may occur if the stent does not fit well or drifts into malposition in a patient with a dynamic tracheal lesion. In such cases, repositioning or removal of the stent would be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Safe emergence and recovery require a high level of vigilance. Continued close observation for one to two hours during the early postoperative period is necessary to verify airway patency. Administration of any long-acting opioid is avoided since insertion of an endotracheal stent or T-tube produces little or no postoperative pain. Furthermore, oversedation is particularly risky in the immediate postoperative period when airway patency may be tenuous.

         For patients with repetitive cough and a primary complaint of feeling a foreign body in the trachea, low doses of a short-acting opioid (eg,

         Tracheal intubation must isolate the TEF while avoiding tracheal soiling with gastric contents. A flexible bronchoscope should always be used for intubation and ETT positioning to ensure that the tip of the ETT stays within the trachea (and does not follow the fistula tract) and that the cuff is positioned in the trachea beyond the fistula. In some cases, the selected tube is advanced over the flexible bronchoscope beyond the fistula into the opposite bronchus so that one lung ventilation (OLV) can be initiated. Then, if necessary, the nonventilated lung can be isolated from the fistula by a bronchial blocker. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14944.html" rel="external">

         Blind tracheal intubation is avoided, as this may result in inadvertently traversing the fistula tract with intubation of the esophagus or mediastinum. Also, avoid positive pressure ventilation (PPV) until the fistula is isolated by placement of the ETT cuff beyond the TEF.

         An SGA may be inserted immediately after induction of general anesthesia to facilitate a quick inspection of the trachea via the flexible bronchoscope, before inserting the ETT (which may cover up the pathology).

          Preservation of spontaneous ventilation until after tracheal intubation
         </strong>
         – If potentially difficult airway anatomy is anticipated, then preservation of spontaneous ventilation until after tracheal intubation may be a safer choice. Suspicion for difficult anatomy should be high in patients with chronic gastric spillage into the trachea and severe tracheal inflammation that may distort anatomic landmarks. This and/or copious secretions create challenges in distinguishing trachea from esophagus or fistula tract during bronchoscopic examination and may increase the time required to secure/isolate the airway.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For such patients, inhalation induction of general anesthesia while maintaining spontaneous ventilation is typically selected to allow additional time to visualize anatomic structures. This technique avoids PPV (and the associated risk of gastric insufflation) until the fistula has been isolated by a properly positioned ETT. (See

          Awake intubation

         Before initiating PPV, verify correct ETT position via flexible bronchoscopy, ensuring that its tip is within the tracheal lumen (and not out through the fistula tract) and that it has been advanced far enough to allow the cuff to be distal to the fistula and above the carina. Avoiding PPV until the fistula has been isolated prevents gastric insufflation and pressurization.

If it is not possible to inflate the tracheal cuff of the DLT due to proximity to the TEF, then a bronchial blocker is used to isolate the nonventilated lung from the TEF and prevent soiling via the fistula. DLT and bronchial blocker devices are described in detail separately. (See

         After general anesthesia has been induced and the airway has been secured, the surgeon will re-evaluate tracheal and esophageal pathology using both bronchoscopy and esophageal endoscopy.

         If the ETT is positioned beyond the fistula, it may be necessary to pull it back intermittently during the surgical repair to visualize and access the TEF. PPV is avoided whenever the fistula is exposed; instead, intermittent ventilation is employed during these periods.

         Since inhalation anesthetic delivery and end-tidal measurements of exhaled concentration are unreliable during intermittent ventilation, we employ a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia to ensure adequate anesthetic depth. (See

          General anesthesia
         </strong>
         – Deep general anesthesia is necessary if rigid bronchoscopy is used. We employ a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique with administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) to prevent patient movement that may cause tracheal injury. (See

          Airway and ventilation management
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         If transoral ventilation is feasible, an oxygen mask, SGA, or ETT may be used. For ventilation via a tracheal stoma, a wire-reinforced "armored" ETT is selected to minimize risk of kinking  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117091" href="/z/d/graphic/117091.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

         ). Ventilation is typically controlled, with periods of intermittent ventilation and removal of the ETT. (See

          dexamethasone

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Avoid long-acting opioids since postoperative pain is minimal and oversedation increases risk of airway compromise. Low doses of a short-acting opioid (eg,

          Procedural considerations

         – In some cases, an occlusive tracheal stent (self-expanding metallic) is positioned via flexible or rigid bronchoscopy  (

         </a>
         ). For open repair, surgical options include a transverse low "collar" incision that may be extended via a partial sternotomy in the supine position, or a right thoracotomy in the left lateral decubitus position for a distally located TEF. (See

          Anesthetic and airway management during maintenance

         – If the ETT is positioned beyond the fistula, it is pulled back intermittently to access the TEF during the surgical repair. Intermittent ventilation is employed, and PPV is avoided whenever the fistula is exposed. We use a TIVA technique because inhalation anesthetic delivery and end-tidal measurements of exhaled concentration are unreliable during intermittent ventilation. (See

          Extubation and recovery
         </strong>
         – Before extubation, flexible bronchoscopy via the existing ETT is used to inspect and further clean the airway. Then the ETT is exchanged for an SGA to allow further bronchoscopic examination of the vocal cords to rule out cord swelling or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Following extubation, judicious positive pressure airway support is employed. Reintubation is usually avoided but can be performed by the surgeon with a small-diameter ETT inserted over a flexible bronchoscope if necessary. Patients are transported to the intensive care unit for observation and postoperative pain management. (See
