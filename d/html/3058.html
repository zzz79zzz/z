         Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), also known as mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis, is a pattern of glomerular injury viewed by light microscopy. Its name is derived from the characteristic histologic changes, including hypercellularity and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, that often lead to a lobular appearance of the glomerular tuft (

         The overall approach to the treatment of an MPGN lesion depends upon identification of the underlying cause. Treatment based upon lesion identification rather than upon the basis of an understanding of the underlying causes and pathogenesis is not advised. Most patients with an MPGN lesion can be classified as having immune complex-mediated disease or complement-mediated disease based upon the immunofluorescence findings on kidney biopsy. This classification system, which provides insight into the pathogenesis of the MPGN lesion, has largely supplanted the older classification system based upon electron microscopy (ie, types I, II, and III). Once the patient has been classified as having immune complex-mediated MPGN or complement-mediated MPGN, a thorough evaluation is performed to identify possible underlying causes, such as infections, autoimmune disorders, monoclonal gammopathies, or activation of the alternative pathway of complement. Patients with an identifiable underlying cause should receive specific treatment as appropriate for the specific disorder. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3055.html" rel="external">
          "Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation of the patient with an MPGN lesion'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In rare cases of immune complex-mediated MPGN, as can be seen in some children and young adults, an identifiable underlying cause cannot be found despite extensive evaluation. Such patients are considered to have an "idiopathic" immune complex-mediated MPGN or immune complex-mediated MPGN of unknown etiology. The optimal treatment of patients with "idiopathic" MPGN is not known. In the absence of high-quality evidence to guide therapy, we suggest a treatment approach below based upon disease severity at the time of presentation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Idiopathic immune complex-mediated MPGN'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         An MPGN lesion can less commonly be associated with thrombotic microangiopathies (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome). Such patients do not have evidence of immune complex or complement deposition by immunofluorescence on kidney biopsy. In general, the treatment of patients with an MPGN lesion associated with thrombotic microangiopathy should address the underlying disorder thought to be responsible for the thrombotic microangiopathy.

         Immune complex-mediated MPGN results from chronic antigenemia and/or circulating immune complexes and can be seen in chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. An underlying cause can be found in the great majority of cases, but despite a thorough evaluation, a small minority remain "idiopathic" or of unknown etiology. This is more commonly seen in children and young adults. (See

         Most patients with immune complex-mediated MPGN have an identifiable underlying cause, such as a chronic infection, autoimmune disease, or monoclonal gammopathy. Such patients should receive therapy directed against the underlying cause of the MPGN since resolution of the MPGN usually occurs after successful treatment of the primary disease. As examples, patients with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) should receive antiviral therapy, while patients with an underlying monoclonal gammopathy should receive systemic therapy directed against the pathologic plasma cell or B cell clone.

         Immune complex-mediated MPGN can be associated with certain autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3055.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Patients with MPGN associated with an autoimmune disorder should receive treatment for their underlying disorder as appropriate, which usually involves the use of immunosuppression. The type and duration of immunosuppressive therapy depends upon the aggressiveness of the autoimmune disorder. As an example, an MPGN lesion in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (class IV lupus nephritis) is treated with combined immunosuppression, even in the absence of extrarenal signs of disease activity. The management of systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune disorders associated with MPGN is presented in more detail elsewhere:

         Patients with MPGN associated with a malignant hematologic disorder such as multiple myeloma or a lymphoproliferative disorder (eg, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) should be referred to an appropriate specialist and treated for the underlying malignancy. The treatment of MPGN in patients with a nonmalignant or premalignant plasma cell or B cell clone (monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance [MGRS]), such as proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID), should target the underlying pathogenic clone, whenever possible. We suggest treating patients with a non-immunoglobulin M (IgM) MGRS with a regimen targeting a plasma cell clone, similar to what is used to treat multiple myeloma. In patients with an IgM MGRS, we suggest a regimen used to treat Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Details are discussed separately:

         Making therapeutic decisions for patients with idiopathic immune complex-mediated MPGN is difficult given the lack of large, randomized, controlled trials or any other evidence clearly demonstrating the efficacy of any treatment regimen. Several parameters at the time of presentation may influence clinical decision-making, including the severity of kidney dysfunction, degree of proteinuria, presence or absence of hematuria, and the histologic findings on kidney biopsy. Some patients with mild disease present with few abnormalities in these parameters, and aggressive treatment with immunosuppressive therapy is generally not indicated in this setting. Other patients present with more abnormalities in various combinations, and treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be appropriate even in the absence of high-quality evidence to support this approach.

         In patients who present with mild disease, characterized by normal kidney function, non-nephrotic-range proteinuria (&lt;3.5 g/day), and no significant hematuria (arbitrarily defined as &lt;10 red blood cells [RBC]/high-power field [HPF]), we suggest conservative therapy (including renin-angiotensin system inhibition) alone (see
         <a class="local">
          'General measures in all patients'
         </a>
         below). We do not treat such patients with immunosuppressive therapy given the lack of evidence of benefit in these cases; in addition, such patients generally have a good prognosis, and immunosuppressive drugs have significant toxicity. Studies in children with MPGN, non-nephrotic-range proteinuria, and normal blood pressure have shown excellent long-term outcomes whether or not the patients were treated with glucocorticoids [

         However, disease progression can occur. As a result, we monitor serum creatinine, urine protein excretion (24-hour urine or spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio), and a urinalysis at three and six months. If spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is used for routine follow-up, a 24-hour urine protein collection should be performed at least once every 6 to 12 months since, in patients with glomerular disease and proteinuria, there is only a moderate correlation between the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and 24-hour urine protein excretion [

         ]. If kidney function and proteinuria remain stable or improve, we continue conservative therapy indefinitely with follow-up every six months. If the patient develops increasing proteinuria, worsening hematuria, or worsening kidney function despite conservative therapy, it is reasonable to perform a repeat kidney biopsy to evaluate disease activity and chronicity. If the biopsy shows evidence of ongoing active glomerulonephritis (ie, mesangial proliferation and/or endocapillary hypercellularity), immunosuppressive therapy may be warranted, as discussed below.

         Evidence in support of immunosuppressive therapy for patients with truly idiopathic MPGN, specifically those presenting with nephrotic syndrome and preserved kidney function, is very limited. Most randomized trials and observational studies used the older electron microscopy classification of MPGN (types I, II, and III), rather than classification based upon underlying disease pathogenesis. In addition, early studies were performed before angiotensin inhibitors were commonly used, and the diagnosis of idiopathic MPGN was made before investigators were as aware of secondary causes such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, monoclonal gammopathies, and complement pathway abnormalities that underlie MPGN. Thus, it is unclear how many of the patients enrolled in these studies truly had "idiopathic" MPGN.

         The best data come from a trial that randomly assigned 80 children (mean age 10 years) with nephrotic-range proteinuria but preserved kidney function to either

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Fifty-nine (74 percent) of the 80 patients had type I or type III MPGN (which would presently be classified as immune complex-mediated MPGN or possibly C3 glomerulonephritis). At entry, the mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 110 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2

         <sup>

         </sup>
         . Patients receiving prednisone experienced a lower rate of treatment failure (defined as an increase in baseline serum creatinine of ≥30 percent or &gt;0.4 mg/dL [35 micromol/L]; 33 versus 58 percent among those with MPGN type I or III). Other observational studies have also suggested a benefit from long-term, alternative-day glucocorticoid therapy in children [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. However, there have been no randomized trials of glucocorticoid therapy in adults with idiopathic MPGN, and retrospective studies have not shown a clear benefit [

         As discussed above, there are very limited data to support the use of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with idiopathic MPGN, and the overall quality of the evidence is low. However, in patients presenting with abnormal kidney function due to MPGN and active glomerulonephritis on kidney biopsy, we feel that a trial of immunosuppressive therapy is warranted to prevent further disease progression, given their otherwise poor prognosis. Our preference for glucocorticoids as initial therapy is based primarily upon the results of one randomized trial and observational studies in children showing a possible benefit; there are no trials systematically evaluating glucocorticoid therapy in adults. These data are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nephrotic syndrome with normal kidney function'

        <p>
         Small observational studies have suggested potential benefit with the use of MMF, typically given with oral glucocorticoids [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. One study included five adults who were treated with MMF and oral

          prednisolone

         and six who were not treated with immunosuppressive agents [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The initial dose of MMF was 500 mg/day, which was gradually increased to 2000 mg/day or until remission of proteinuria was achieved; the average drug dose was 1100 mg/day. The initial prednisolone dose was 60 mg/day tapered to 20 mg/day within two months and withdrawn at one year. At 18 months, proteinuria decreased from 5.1 to 2.6 g/day in the MMF group compared with no change in proteinuria in patients who were not treated. In addition, the creatinine clearance increased in the MMF group (103 to 159 mL/min) and decreased in the control group (108 to 67 mL/min). However, the relative contribution of MMF and prednisolone could not be ascertained.

Proteinuria decreased in all patients at one year (mean proteinuria 2.1 g/day), and there was no significant change in mean serum creatinine. No patients experienced any adverse effects.

         Immune complex-mediated MPGN secondary to infection or autoimmune disease is less likely to recur after kidney transplantation than MPGN due to a monoclonal gammopathy or complement-mediated disease [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-28
         </a>
         ]. MPGN due to proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID) has a high risk of recurrence, even if no circulating serum or urine paraprotein can be detected (which occurs in 70 percent of the cases). Transplantation of such patients is generally not advised unless a plan to address the underlying plasma cell disorder has been established.

         As with other glomerular diseases, patients with MPGN who present with non-nephrotic proteinuria (less than 3.5 g/day, no hypoalbuminemia, and no edema), normal serum creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), absence of hematuria, and normal blood pressure have a benign prognosis as long as the kidney manifestations do not become more prominent. Poor prognostic signs at presentation include the nephrotic syndrome, an elevated serum creatinine, hypertension (or blood pressure well above the patient's previous baseline), and, on kidney biopsy, crescents [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,29-33
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria and normal blood pressure appear to have an excellent long-term kidney prognosis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,30
         </a>
         ]. Greater degrees of hematuria (eg, 50 or more versus 5 to 20 red blood cells [RBC]/high-power field [HPF]) suggest more inflammation, but there is no evidence of an independent effect on prognosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to common clinical presentations'

        </p>
        <p>
         Another important adverse prognostic sign on kidney biopsy is tubulointerstitial disease (interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and tubular atrophy) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32-34
         </a>
         ]. The risk of progression usually correlates more closely with the severity of the tubulointerstitial injury than with the degree of glomerular damage. This finding is typical of most glomerular diseases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">

          Overview
         </strong>
         – The overall approach to the treatment of an membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) lesion depends upon identification of the underlying cause. Most patients with an MPGN lesion can be classified as having immune complex-mediated disease or complement-mediated disease based upon the immunofluorescence findings on kidney biopsy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of treatment'

         <strong>
          Immune complex-mediated MPGN with an underlying cause
         </strong>
         – Most patients with immune complex-mediated MPGN have an identifiable underlying cause, such as a chronic infection, autoimmune disease, or monoclonal gammopathy. Such patients should receive therapy directed against the underlying cause of the MPGN since resolution of the MPGN usually occurs after successful treatment of the primary disease. (See

          'Patients with an underlying cause'

          Idiopathic immune complex-mediated MPGN

         – Patients with immune complex-mediated MPGN who do not have an identifiable underlying cause are considered to have "idiopathic" MPGN or MPGN of unknown etiology. However, such cases are now
         <strong>
          rare

         , especially among adults. Our approach to the most common clinical scenarios is based primarily upon low-quality evidence and our clinical experience (see

          Nephrotic syndrome with normal kidney function
         </strong>
         – For patients who present with nephrotic syndrome and normal (or near-normal) kidney function, with or without an active urinary sediment (arbitrarily defined as &gt;10 RBC/HPF), we suggest immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conservative therapy, rather than conservative therapy alone (
