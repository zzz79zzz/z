The acute process is self-limited, rarely causes hepatic failure, and usually leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years and can ultimately result in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for liver transplantation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3672.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>Successful antiviral treatment of chronic HCV infection halts the progression of liver disease and is associated with improvement in liver-related morbidity and mortality. Although contemporary antiviral regimens are highly effective, a small minority does not respond to initial treatment. In contrast to the limited evaluation needed prior to initial treatment, patients with relapse warrant more detailed assessment and monitoring to optimize the likelihood of cure with retreatment.</p><p>This topic will review the pretreatment evaluation, antiviral selection, and antiviral administration for chronic HCV infection that was not cured by initial treatment.</p><p>Our recommendations are generally consistent with joint guidelines on HCV management from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), which can be accessed at <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hcvguidelines.org%2F&amp;token=sL%2Bp%2BgWoM5K8OZ3TcR7z2aLRyWCGNBK9vbXZNzy9A7wOhWa41Lo4fh2xvvlb%2BhyX&amp;TOPIC_ID=15795" target="_blank">www.hcvguidelines.org</a> [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Management issues other than antiviral retreatment for relapsed chronic HCV infection are discussed elsewhere: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3673.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16592.html" rel="external">"Management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Initial antiviral therapy in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3650.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acute hepatitis C virus infection in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H191418900"><span class="h1">TREATMENT OBJECTIVE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical objective of HCV treatment is cure of the infection. In the clinical setting and in HCV treatment trials, the marker for treatment success is a sustained virologic response (SVR), which is defined as an undetectable HCV viral level 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. An SVR at this time period has been associated with a &gt;99 percent chance of sustained clearance of HCV, an effective cure of HCV infection [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. SVR has also been associated with patient-important outcomes such as decreased mortality, decreased liver-related complications, and improved quality of life. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Benefits of treatment'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2499909193"><span class="h1">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The general approach to evaluation prior to HCV antiviral therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere. Issues specific to evaluation prior to retreatment are discussed here. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H74334893"><span class="h2">Determining reasons for relapse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our main objective in evaluating patients who experienced relapse following a contemporary direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108951" href="/d/drug information/108951.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114296" href="/d/drug information/114296.html" rel="external">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a>) is to determine why treatment was not successful. If we identify a potential contributor to relapse, we address any modifiable factors with the patient prior to retreatment. </p><p>Such factors include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adherence challenges</strong> – If patients missed more than several doses of the regimen or stopped it prematurely, we work with them to determine why they were unable to take the regimen as prescribed and identify ways to improve adherence. The proportion of the regimen completed may also impact selection of the retreatment regimen. (See <a class="local">'Patients who did not finish a complete initial course'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Administration issues</strong> – If a patient took <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114296" href="/d/drug information/114296.html" rel="external">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a> without food, that may have decreased absorption and thus efficacy of the regimen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drug interactions</strong> – We re-evaluate for potential drug interactions that may have not initially been appreciated. In particular, for patients who used <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108951" href="/d/drug information/108951.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="97562" href="/d/drug information/97562.html" rel="external">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a> for their initial regimen, we assess whether they took any antacids or acid-reducing medications (including over the counter medications), which could decrease absorption of these antivirals. Identifying and minimizing antacid use is especially important because the primary regimen for retreatment (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a>) is also acid dependent for absorption. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2889296469"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretreatment evaluation includes testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and pregnancy, if not already performed. For patients with relapsed infection, we also evaluate for stage of fibrosis and check the genotype, even if they had a baseline genotype determined prior to initial therapy. </p><p>Although knowledge of the genotype is not always necessary for regimen selection, it may help distinguish relapse from reinfection, which has treatment implications, as discussed below. Additionally, identifying genotype 3 infection is important, as it is associated with lower response rates to retreatment and may warrant adjustment of the retreatment regimen. </p><p>These elements of the pretreatment evaluation are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3656402182"><span class="h2">Distinguishing relapse from reinfection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients identified as having recurrent HCV viremia following completion of initial antiviral therapy have either relapsed infection (nonresponse to antiviral therapy) or reinfection. Reinfection is treated with a regimen used for initial therapy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16592.html" rel="external">"Management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Initial antiviral therapy in adults"</a>). In contrast, relapsed infection usually warrants a different regimen for optimal retreatment. Overall, we have a low threshold to treat someone with a regimen used for relapsed infection if there is any uncertainty. (See <a class="local">'Regimen selection for relapse after DAA therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In some cases, the distinction between reinfection and relapse is straightforward: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent HCV viremia that is identified within 12 weeks of completing initial therapy and is with the same genotype as before therapy is relapse. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent HCV viremia that is with a different genotype than before therapy is reinfection. </p><p></p><p>However, in patients who had a documented SVR and have the same genotype as before therapy (or had unknown genotype before therapy), the distinction is less clear and depends on the likelihood of repeat exposure. In such cases, we consider recurrent viremia to reflect reinfection if they have ongoing exposure (eg, injection drug use) and relapse if there is no clear exposure. If recurrent viremia is with a genotype that is rare in the area (eg, genotype 4 infection in the United States), relapse is also more likely. Although rare, late relapse after SVR is a possible explanation for recurrent HCV infection with the same genotype. As an example, in a study of 3000 patients who had participated in antiviral trials and achieved SVR, only 11 had subsequent recurrent viremia with the same genotype [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that five represented relapse and the other six reinfection with a different virus.</p><p>In many cases, patients do not have a documented SVR (eg, because of loss to follow up) and are subsequently found to have HCV viremia. Unless we can document that the infecting genotype is different than in the original infection, we manage such patients as having relapsed infection. In some cases, resistance testing can help determine whether they can be treated with a regimen for initial therapy, although this is not generally necessary. (See <a class="local">'Limited role for resistance testing'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H791400441"><span class="h2">Limited role for resistance testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not routinely check resistance testing prior to retreatment following relapse from initial antiviral therapy. This is because the primary regimen used for relapsed infection, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a>, has such a high barrier to resistance that it remains active despite resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>The main exception is for patients with genotype 3 infection and relapse after interferon-based regimens. In such cases, resistance testing can help guide antiviral selection. (See <a class="local">'Genotype 3'</a> below.)</p><p>One of the authors of this topic also occasionally uses resistance testing when trying to distinguish between reinfection and relapse or when determining regimen options for someone who did not complete the initial course of therapy. In such cases, the absence of NS5A RASs suggests that one of the regimens used for initial therapy may be a reasonable option; in contrast, the presence of NS5A RASs would favor a regimen used for relapsed infection. Such resistance testing and analysis, however, should generally be done with guidance from an expert in HCV infection. Given the ambiguity in such situations, using a regimen recommended for relapsed infection without resistance testing is an appropriate approach that may be more straightforward. (See <a class="local">'Regimen selection for relapse after DAA therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>Overall, the clinical value of identifying RASs is limited. Although relapse is associated with selection of RASs, those RASs do not necessarily predict worse outcomes with regimens recommended for relapse. As an example, in a trial of 146 patients with genotype 1 infection who had previously failed an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108951" href="/d/drug information/108951.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a>), the majority had NS3/4A or NS5A RAS at baseline, but overall SVR rates were high (96 to 100 percent) with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a> treatment, and RASs were not associated a lower likelihood of SVR [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2159689354"><span class="h1">REGIMEN SELECTION FOR RELAPSE AFTER DAA THERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H947428728"><span class="h2">Patients who did not finish a complete initial course</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who started but did not complete a course of initial therapy for HCV infection should have the HCV viral level checked. In some cases, patients can achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) after abbreviated regimens, and no additional therapy is needed if the HCV viral level is undetectable &gt;12 weeks after stopping therapy. For those with persistent infection (ie, a detectable viral level), our general approach to retreatment depends on how many weeks of the initial course they completed, the genotype, and the presence of cirrhosis. Overall, we have a low threshold to use a regimen for relapsed infection:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who completed more than four weeks of the initial antiviral course, have genotype 3 infection, or have advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis, we suggest one of the treatment regimens preferred for relapsed infection, as outlined below. (See <a class="local">'Relapse after sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (or other sofosbuvir-NS5A combination)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Relapse after glecaprevir-pibrentasvir'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those who completed less than four weeks of the initial antiviral course, who do not have genotype 3 infection, and who have no cirrhosis, we suggest repeat treatment with one of the regimens preferred for initial therapy, as outlined elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16592.html" rel="external">"Management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Initial antiviral therapy in adults", section on 'Our preferred regimens'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The ultimate decision on selecting a regimen for retreatment in such situations should be individualized. Repeating treatment with one of the regimens generally reserved for initial therapy could be useful for patients who have drug interactions that preclude use of a protease inhibitor (which is a component of regimens for relapsed infection). On the other hand, some patients may prefer to optimize the likelihood of response, even if that means using a regimen that includes a higher number of antiviral medications or has a longer duration, in which case we suggest a regimen for relapsed infection. In some cases, resistance testing can help determine whether patients who did not complete a full course can be retreated with a regimen for initial therapy, although this is not generally necessary. (See <a class="local">'Limited role for resistance testing'</a> above.) </p><p>Retreatment of certain patients with an initial therapy regimen is supported by limited data that demonstrate reasonably high SVR rates in patients retreated after short courses of investigational antiviral combinations. In a trial of 34 patients who had genotype 1 infection, early stage liver fibrosis, and relapse after a four- to six-week course of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="97562" href="/d/drug information/97562.html" rel="external">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a> plus an investigational antiviral agent, 91 percent achieved SVR after retreatment with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 12 weeks [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Only one patient had virologic failure (relapse). </p><p>Because genotype 3 and cirrhosis have each been associated with lower SVR rates with certain regimens, we have a low threshold to treat patients who have either of these features with a regimen appropriate for relapse following an abbreviated initial antiviral course. Consulting with an expert in HCV management is useful when this decision is uncertain. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3025265821"><span class="h2">Relapse after sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (or other sofosbuvir-NS5A combination)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with relapsed infection following <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108951" href="/d/drug information/108951.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> (or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="97562" href="/d/drug information/97562.html" rel="external">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a>), we suggest: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</strong> – Details on administration are discussed elsewhere (see <a class="local">'Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir'</a> below).

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/86452.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Treatment for hepatitis C (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12156966"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefits of HCV therapy</strong> – We recommend antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic HCV infection (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>). A sustained virologic response (SVR), or an undetectable HCV viral level 12 weeks after the completion of therapy, indicates effective cure of HCV infection. SVR has been associated with decreased mortality, decreased liver-related complications, and improved quality of life, regardless of liver disease stage. (See <a class="local">'Treatment objective'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of patients with relapse after treatment </strong>– Although contemporary antiviral regimens are highly effective, a small minority does not respond and has persistent or recurrent HCV viremia following the initial treatment course. In contrast to the limited evaluation needed prior to initial treatment, patients with relapse warrant more detailed assessment and monitoring to optimize the likelihood of cure with retreatment. (See <a class="local">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Identifying and addressing potentially modifiable contributors to treatment failure (eg, adherence challenges or unappreciated drug interactions) are essential. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We also assess fibrosis stage, if not recently done, and check a genotype (even if checked prior to initial therapy). Knowledge of the genotype may help distinguish relapse from reinfection in individuals with recurrent exposure, and in some cases (ie, with genotype 3) has treatment implications. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Additional aspects of the pre-treatment evaluation are discussed elsewhere. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retreatment of relapse after DAA therapy</strong> – For patients with relapsed infection following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy (ie, they did not achieve sustained virologic response [SVR] after an initial antiviral regimen), we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a> rather than other regimens (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). This regimen results in SVR rates over 90 to 95 percent and is well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. (See <a class="local">'Relapse after sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (or other sofosbuvir-NS5A combination)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Relapse after glecaprevir-pibrentasvir'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For most patients, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a> is given for 12 weeks. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who relapsed after <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108951" href="/d/drug information/108951.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="97562" href="/d/drug information/97562.html" rel="external">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a>, have genotype 3 infection, and have compensated cirrhosis, we suggest giving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a> either for 24 weeks or with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9860" href="/d/drug information/9860.html" rel="external">ribavirin</a> for 12 weeks (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who relapsed after <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114296" href="/d/drug information/114296.html" rel="external">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a> and have compensated cirrhosis, we suggest giving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a> either for 24 weeks or with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9860" href="/d/drug information/9860.html" rel="external">ribavirin</a> for 12 weeks (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retreatment when the diagnosis of relapse is uncertain</strong> – In patients with recurrent HCV viremia following an initial treatment course, relapse can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from reinfection or an insufficient, abbreviated course of therapy. When there is any uncertainty, we have a low threshold to treat as if they have relapsed infection (ie, with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="114088" href="/d/drug information/114088.html" rel="external">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</a>). However, for those who have clear reinfection (eg, a different genotype than in the initial infection) or for those who took less than four weeks of the initial antiviral regimen, have no cirrhosis, and have non-genotype 3 infection, a regimen used for initial therapy is reasonable. (See <a class="local">'Distinguishing relapse from reinfection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Patients who did not finish a complete initial course'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drug interactions with </strong><strong>sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir</strong> – Potential drug interactions should be evaluated prior to administration. Increased gastric pH levels decrease absorption of velpatasvir; thus, we avoid coadministration with proton pump inhibitors and other acid-reducing medications (including over-the-counter medications) when possible. (See <a class="local">'Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Monitoring includes evaluation for rare adverse effects and adherence assessment throughout the treatment course. The latter is especially important during treatment for relapsed infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3673.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Monitoring during antiviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Post-treatment follow-up</strong> – All patients should undergo HCV viral level testing at least 12 weeks after completing therapy to assess for treatment success. This and other aspects of follow-up are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3673.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Follow-up after antiviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1085348983"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Sanjiv Chopra, MD, MACP, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis C.
