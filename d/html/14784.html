         Psychosis – ie, a significant impairment in reality testing, as evidenced by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, thought disorganization and grossly disorganized behavior – can result from medical and neurological conditions, from use of certain substances, or as a manifestations of a psychiatric disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychosis is seen in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (and other conditions in the schizophrenia spectrum), bipolar disorder, and major depression with psychotic features. In patients ultimately diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the first episode of psychosis most commonly occurs between the ages of 15 to 30 years [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. First episode psychosis is typically preceded by subtle premorbid signs in childhood and subsyndromal prodromal symptoms.

         Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults are reviewed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis of schizophrenia in adults and children are also reviewed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment and diagnosis of bipolar disorder in adults and children are also reviewed separately.

         The incidence of new cases of psychosis worldwide has been estimated at approximately 50 in 100,000 people, while the incidence of new cases of schizophrenia (the most frequent eventual diagnosis among cases of first episode psychosis) is approximately 15 in 100,000 per year [
         <a href="#rid2">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The rate of onset of schizophrenia increases during adolescence, with the peak ages of onset ranging from 15 to 30 years. The peak age of onset is, for males, teens to mid-20s and, for females, teens to the late 20s. Eighteen percent of schizophrenia occurs before age 18 and tends to have a poorer outcome. The distribution by age of new cases of psychosis has not been well studied.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although psychosis can occur in childhood, it is quite rare (approximately 1 in 10,000) and is more common in boys than girls [

          Brain changes

         – Studies in the first episode and prodrome of psychosis have shown reductions in multiple brain regions including prefrontal, superior, and medial temporal lobe gray matter volumes that are present in the first episode and in those high-risk individuals who go on to develop later psychosis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The neuroanatomical changes in the early stages of psychosis appear to be progressive changes beyond those associated with normal development [

          8

         ]. Cortical gray matter density declines normally during late adolescent development in the same brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

          Neurodevelopmental abnormalities
         </strong>
         – Schizophrenia, which fully emerges during late adolescence or early adulthood with the onset of psychosis, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that most likely begins to develop in utero [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. It is likely that pre- or perinatal neurodevelopmental abnormalities may lead to a vulnerability to postpubertal insults that contribute to the accelerated loss of gray matter and aberrant connectivity in the prefrontal regions of vulnerable individuals.

          Neuropathological mechanisms in early psychosis
         </strong>
         <strong>
          –
         </strong>
         Epigenetic factors, such as substance abuse, stress, and maternal infection, may contribute to a later neurodegenerative process [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,10,11
         </a>
         ]. While disturbances of neurodevelopment early in life may be necessary for the future emergence of psychosis, environmental influences during the late adolescent period may contribute to the emergence of first episode of psychosis via a range of possible interconnected neuropathological mechanisms, including increased hypothalamic pituitary axis activity, neuroinflammation, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction, glutamatergic or dopaminergic transmission abnormalities and reduced neuroplasticity, all of which are potential targets for early intervention in the prodrome or first episode of psychosis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Increasing evidence suggests that the neuropathological changes in the prodrome and first episode of psychosis are dynamic and different than what is observed in the more chronic forms of the illness. This neuroplasticity in early psychosis offers a window of opportunity to alter the course of the illness.

         Depressive symptoms, including dysphoria, anhedonia, amotivation, sleep disturbance, and suicidal thoughts, may be the presenting symptoms in the prodrome or first episode of psychosis. Depressive symptoms are associated with a less favorable outcome. (See

        <p>
         At the onset of a first episode psychosis, before it is known whether psychosis is a manifestation of schizophrenia or a psychotic mood disorder, depressive symptoms must be differentiated from negative symptoms or extrapyramidal symptoms and dysphoria from antipsychotic drugs.

         Functional impairment is present even before the onset of psychosis and linked to neurocognitive impairment. Functional impairment in the prodrome is a predictor of which individuals will go on to develop a full psychotic episode. Early psychosis treatment programs are designed to target the significant functional impairment early in the course of illness using recovery-based service.

         Minor physical anomalies, suggestive of neurodevelopment abnormalities, are also commonly noted prior to the onset of psychotic illness and include evidence of facial dysmorphia, such as a wide skull base or abnormal size of facial features. The socioemotional difficulties that characterize the premorbid phase include behavioral problems such as antisocial externalizing behavior and evidence of social isolation by age 11.

         There has been increasing interest in identifying individuals at high-risk psychosis so that it is possible to intervene early and perhaps prevent the development of a full psychotic syndrome. Individuals who develop psychosis typically experience a prodromal period of illness that can last from a few weeks to a few years. It is characterized by subsyndromal psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and a deterioration in functioning. Because the true prodrome can only be diagnosed retrospectively, other terms have been developed to describe a syndrome that is at high risk, but not inevitable risk, for developing psychosis. Various terms have been developed to describe this prodromal syndrome (see

         Patients meeting criteria for attenuated psychosis syndrome have been found to have a relatively high prevalence of SUDs compared with the general population. In a review of 10 published studies, cannabis, alcohol, and nicotine were found to be the most commonly used substances in the attenuated psychosis syndrome samples, with the use of cannabis (range 33 to 54 percent) and nicotine (16 to 34 percent) being higher than in healthy controls and similar to individuals in their first episode of psychosis [

         A primary psychiatric disorder is considered when substances, medications, and nonpsychiatric underlying medical conditions have been ruled out as causes for psychotic symptoms. The differential diagnosis for psychosis is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17193.html" rel="external">

         On initial assessment of a first psychotic episode, it is often difficult to determine the primary diagnosis and only longitudinal follow-up and careful history will help to sort out the most likely diagnosis. The associated symptoms, time course of illness, and family history provide valuable information for the differential diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If the psychotic symptoms are more attenuated, an attenuated psychosis syndrome should be considered along with other DSM-5 diagnoses that present with psychotic-like symptoms (schizotypal personality disorder, autism spectrum, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prodrome of psychosis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Autism, characterized by social communication dysfunction and bizarre behavior, is typically evident from childhood and does not include positive psychotic symptoms. Posttraumatic stress disorder is characterized by a history of trauma and reexperiencing the trauma. Obsessive compulsive disorder includes obsessions and compulsions.

         Goals for the initial management of patients with first episode psychosis are to assure safety, improve symptoms, and promote functional recovery. Interventions to achieve these goals are reviewed separately. Treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia, a disorder often eventually diagnosed in many patients with first psychotic episode, is also reviewed separately.

         Early identification and intervention efforts seek to identify individuals with first episode psychosis or during the prodrome of psychosis, a period associated with high risk for psychosis, and to intervene to treat or perhaps prevent the development of a full psychotic syndrome. (See

        <p>
         Early identification and intervention efforts were developed to reduce what have been, on average, lengthy, years-long delays from psychosis onset to detection and treatment. Such delays have been associated with poorer treatment responses in analyses of patients ultimately diagnosed with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders [

         A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials found that early intervention services led to better clinical outcomes for patients with first episode psychosis compared with treatment as usual [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. The ten trials randomly assigned 2176 patients to receive early intervention services or treatment as usual. Patients assigned to early intervention services had superior results on all meta-analyzable outcomes studied, including any psychiatric hospitalization (relative risk = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90), involvement in school or work (relative risk = 1.13; 95% CI 1.03-1.24), and total symptom severity (standardized mean difference = -0.32; 95% CI -0.47 to -0.17).
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 120 patients with first episode psychosis to receive specialized treatment (medication, family education, cognitive-behavioral therapy, case management, and employment or educational support) or treatment as usual [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41

After one year, specialized treatment participants were more likely have no inpatient hospitalizations compared with those in usual treatment (77 versus 56 percent; risk ratio = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.58) and better vocational engagement (91.7 versus 66.7 percent; risk ratio = 1.40, 95% CI 1.18-1.48). The two groups did not differ in global functioning.

         It is important to perform a thorough history – including child developmental history – physical examination, mental status examination, and workup in order to assess the clinical status and provisional diagnosis, rule out treatable underlying causes of psychosis, and guide appropriate therapy.

         Children who go on to develop schizophrenia have subtle neuromotor abnormalities, developmental delays, socioemotional abnormalities, and neurocognitive impairment prior to onset of the illness (ie, during the premorbid phase). In addition to delays or abnormalities in speech, they often experience a delay in developmental milestones such as sitting, standing, and walking alone. (See

         Individuals who develop psychosis typically experience a prodromal period that can last from a few weeks to a few years. It is characterized by subsyndromal psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and a deterioration in functioning. Patients manifesting this syndrome are at high risk, but not inevitable risk, for developing psychosis. (See
