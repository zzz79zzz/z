During the height of PAD activity, advocacy for participation in PAD centered on purported benefit derived from the mitigation of transfusion-associated infections, in particular, viral disease. Additionally heralded was the consideration for general enhancement of the blood supply, both in terms of use of autologous products in lieu of allogeneic products, and the potential for "crossover" of unused autologous units to general inventory. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Since the peak of use in 1993, there has been a steady decline, according to the National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) that is published every two years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>By 2019, PAD accounted for 0.3 percent of donations; the number of recipients of autologous blood has similarly declined [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1024596899"><span class="h2">Reasons for declining use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Use of PAD has declined for a number of reasons. As a result, the true benefit of PAD has become questionable [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>Factors that have influenced the decline of PAD usage include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increasing safety of the general blood supply</strong> – Over time, the safety of the blood supply has increased due to introduction of nucleic acid testing and other infectious disease screening. The risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV has declined to 1 in 2 million units. Enhanced laboratory testing of donated blood has increased confidence among surgical patients and clinicians and reduced motivation to bank autologous blood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing", section on 'HIV-1 and HIV-2'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Greater likelihood of transfusion</strong> – Studies performed at the height of PAD activity showed that the rate of perioperative transfusion was increased in patients who donated autologous blood compared with those who did not. As examples: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 2002 trial randomly assigned 96 patients undergoing elective total hip replacement who had a baseline hemoglobin of ≥12 g/dL to donate or not donate two units of blood for autologous transfusion and found that approximately 40 percent of the autologous units were wasted [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. No patient in either group received an allogeneic transfusion. Mean hemoglobin values were lower in the autologous donors on admission to the hospital (12.9 g/dL, versus 13.8 g/dL in the controls), and 69 percent of the autologous donors received one or two units of their own blood. None of the controls received a transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 1996 study involving patients undergoing elective hysterectomy found that, of 140 individuals who donated autologous blood prior to hysterectomy, the mean admission hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dL, and 25 (18 percent) were transfused; of 123 who did donate autologous blood, the mean admission hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL, and only 1 (0.8 percent) was transfused (p &lt;0.001) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Logistic regression confirmed that autologous donation was an independent risk factor for transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With improved surgical techniques leading to less blood loss and uniform acceptance of lower transfusion thresholds, it is probable that similar studies, if performed today, would demonstrate a narrowing of the differences in rate of perioperative transfusion for those who used PAD and those who did not. However, this does not take away from the observation that PAD results in lower admission hemoglobin (and in some cases in anemia), which is not beneficial to the patient. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Historically</strong> <strong>high rate of PAD unit</strong> <strong>discard</strong> – Blood donated for autologous transfusion is not transferred to the general blood supply if not used by the autologous donor; it is discarded. During the peak of PAD participation in the late 1980s, as few as 40 percent of units were used, resulting in as many as 60 percent being discarded [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Crossover (release to other recipients) is no longer used'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reduced transfusion rates with patient blood management</strong> – Institution of patient blood management (PBM) programs has led to an emphasis on restrictive transfusion thresholds and reduction in the rate of transfusion overall; changes are largely based on data from randomized trials demonstrating equivalent or better outcomes when restrictive transfusion thresholds are used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Restrictive transfusion strategy for most stable patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other contributions to the decline in transfusion rates include the use of cell salvage and other blood recovery approaches, as well as improved surgical techniques and incorporation of antifibrinolytic agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7936.html" rel="external">"Surgical blood conservation: Acute normovolemic hemodilution"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7937.html" rel="external">"Surgical blood conservation: Intraoperative blood salvage"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased cost of PAD</strong> – Use of PAD adds costs related to the extra time and attention required for obtaining and processing the units (additional labels, separate storage, early delivery to the hospital), administering them when needed, discarding when not used (applies to more than half of PAD units collected), and enhanced clerical requirements [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. As a result, autologous blood is considerably more expensive than allogeneic blood. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Decision analysis models evaluating the costs of all potential outcomes, published &gt;2 decades ago, at a time when transfusion-transmitted viral infections were of significant concern, suggested that PAD was not cost-effective [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Greatly improved screening assays for infectious diseases plus the high discard rate of autologous units have likely magnified the lack of cost-effectiveness [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Potential for complications related to</strong> <strong>PAD</strong> – With the decline in PAD, the number of hospital-based autologous blood collection programs has waned. Instead, patients are referred to local blood centers who have expertise in donor collection, processing, labeling, and shipping. Despite the shift to blood centers for collection and donor unit management, there remains the potential, as with any collected and distributed blood product, for undetectable bacterial growth during liquid storage and for clerical error, resulting in the donor/patient receiving allogeneic blood rather than the pre-donated autologous units [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Additionally, processing errors or technical errors at the collection facility may render units inappropriate for distribution and transfusion [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elimination of crossover</strong> – (See <a class="local">'Crossover (release to other recipients) is no longer used'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1361711859"><span class="h2">Crossover (release to other recipients) is no longer used</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When PAD programs first gained popularity, most programs allowed autologous blood that met all criteria applied to allogeneic blood, including medical history screening and laboratory testing, and was not used by the original patient (donor) to be "crossed-over" and made available to other recipients as allogeneic blood.</p><p>As late as 1987, crossover was allowed in 65 percent of PAD programs; by 1990, however, only 2 percent of programs continued this practice [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The practice of crossover of autologous units into the general inventory has disappeared. </p><p>Safety concerns exist about the patient/donor's understanding of the nature of their underlying illnesses and medical history. The donor may also be motived to omit pertinent information about infectious risks to allow them to use PAD, in contrast with the community donor's presumed altruistic motivation. </p><p>The concern about increased infectious risk from PAD units is supported by data that indicate a higher frequency of positive viral markers in red blood cell units drawn from PAD donors compared with units drawn from volunteer allogeneic donors. In a study from 1989, the following higher risk ratios [RR] for autologous PAD units eligible for crossover based on donor history versus volunteer allogeneic units were noted [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1.8 (99% CI 0.34-7.68) for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2.5 (99% CI 1.90-3.24) for anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3.5 (99% CI 1.31-8.86) for rapid plasma reagin (RPR; screening test for syphilis)</p><p></p><p>Another concern with crossover is the reluctance of many surgeons to release autologous blood until so late in its dating period that it is difficult to guarantee its use for another patient. As a result, there was an added burden of needing to make a separate crossover eligibility determination for each donated unit and an increase in complexity of record keeping and billing for a relatively small benefit in terms of the number of units added to the system. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">APPROPRIATE USE OF PAD</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25011533"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, PAD would be used to collect autologous units from individuals who are most likely to use them. </p><p>The most compelling indication is for an individual scheduled for a surgical procedure with recognized high probability for transfusion who has developed multiple antibodies or alloantibodies to high frequency antigens and for whom a sufficient number of allogeneic units may not be guaranteed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7954.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in individuals with serologic complexity", section on 'Alloantibodies'</a>.) </p><p>Another group of patients are those who refuse allogeneic units for religious or other personal reasons, although devout Jehovah Witnesses do <strong>not</strong> consider transfusion of autologous blood to be an acceptable alternative to allogeneic transfusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7927.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient who declines blood transfusion", section on 'Jehovah's Witnesses'</a>.)</p><p>If indicated, autologous donation can be used in children &gt;40 to 45 kg and when phlebotomy of 15 percent of the blood volume is feasible. The amount of blood stored needs to correlate with the equipment and blood bags for storage (eg, storage of half units). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5935.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Selection of blood products"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no specific contraindications to PAD; the physician referring the patient needs to make the assessment with thoughtful consideration of the patient's general health and comorbidities. The blood collection center will make the ultimate decision regarding whether donation is safe. </p><p>General exclusions from PAD would include conditions that would be exacerbated by transient anemia (eg, unstable angina or aortic stenosis).</p><p>Individuals with an acute infection cannot donate; the contraindication particularly applies if it could be associated with bacteremia. Although most bacteria will not proliferate in the cold (during blood storage), some psychrophilic organisms such as <em>Yersinia enterocolitica </em>can reach peak concentrations in blood within one or two weeks of storage at 4°C. Transfusion of this blood after prolonged cold storage has been associated with fatal reactions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">"Blood donor screening: Medical history", section on 'General symptoms of active infection'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1844115271"><span class="h2">Adhering to transfusion guidelines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transfusion of autologous blood is not without potential toxicity, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemolysis secondary to improper handling of the saved units [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sepsis resulting from bacterial contamination of the saved units [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulmonary edema induced by volume overload (TACO) or possibly transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transfusion of the wrong unit of blood due to patient misidentification [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]</p><p></p><p>These potential complications make it imperative that autologous blood be transfused wisely and only when specifically indicated. <strong>It is never reasonable to transfuse an autologous unit simply because it is available or would otherwise be discarded.</strong> Similarly, autologous blood should not be transfused to replace iron, to promote wound healing or general well-being, or to normalize the hemoglobin level. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2594047500"><span class="h2">Compatibility testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretransfusion compatibility testing can be abbreviated for the autologous donor/patient. Nevertheless, it is good practice to perform the following testing:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ABO group and RhD type on a patient specimen.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antibody screen on a patient specimen.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirmation of ABO group and RhD type on the autologous unit.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior to issuing the unit for transfusion, as a precaution against a clerical or labeling error, crossmatch in accordance with transfusion service practice.</p><p></p><p>The extent of infectious disease testing is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Extent of infectious disease testing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">HOW TO ACCESS PAD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In light of the waning interest (see <a class="local">'Reasons for declining use'</a> above), PAD programs are largely the purview of blood collection centers. Should the physician/surgeon and patient determine that PAD is appropriate, the following actions/recommendations should be considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Physician request</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients are accepted into PAD programs at the request of their physician, usually the surgeon who will perform the surgery or the anesthesiologist. This clinician, or a colleague with credentials in family practice, internal medicine, or cardiology, must certify that the phlebotomies pose no undue risk to the patient. The final decision regarding acceptability rests with the medical director of the blood collection facility.</p><p>The number of PAD units donated depends on the procedure (how many units are likely to be needed) and the individual's hemoglobin (how well they can tolerate the donation procedure). Most donor centers monitor the patient's hemoglobin prior to each donation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Scheduling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most practical schedule for obtaining more than one unit of autologous blood is to draw units at weekly intervals, with the last unit drawn approximately two weeks prior to surgery. </p><p>It is allowable to donate the final unit as close as 72 hours prior to surgery, as this allows for the volume and protein losses to be replaced. However, we strongly discourage this practice, since there is no useful purpose served by drawing blood when there is insufficient time for red blood cells to be substantially replenished, which takes approximately two weeks.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H777610212"><span class="h2">Iron supplementation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should begin oral iron supplementation as soon as the surgery is scheduled. The optimal supplementation dosing and schedule for blood donors has not been established. Often donors are told to take daily iron, but data in individuals with iron deficiency suggests that alternate day dosing is equally effective and better tolerated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7148.html" rel="external">"Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Oral iron'</a>.) </p><p>Preoperative treatment of anemia should be considered first when evaluating a patient in the setting of perioperative blood management [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].

Abbott (Bragdon v Abbott, 118 S. Ct. 2196 [1998]) specifically provides protection to HIV-infected individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. AABB, the American Red Cross, and the Department of Defense have interpreted (and extended) this decision to HIV-infected individuals wishing to participate in PAD programs, and they suggest that denying participation to these donors may run counter to the intent of the Bragdon decision. The complex medical, ethical, and legal issues related to participation of HIV-infected donors were further addressed by the autologous transfusion committee of the AABB [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Not allow –</strong> Decision analysis has been used to calculate the anticipated benefits of providing known infected patients with the opportunity to participate in PAD programs versus the risks to them of having to receive allogeneic blood [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The benefits attained by these known infected patients were also compared with the adverse consequences potentially experienced by other patients and/or health care workers inadvertently exposed to the infected blood from the autologous patient/donor. The conclusion was that, given the safety of allogeneic blood, the benefit to be derived by providing autologous blood to patients infected with HIV, HBV, or HCV is very small, particularly when compared with the potential harm to health care workers (and other patients) should<strong> in</strong>fectious blood be allowed into the system. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Given the issue of safety to others, it is possible that the Bragdon decision may not apply to participation in PAD programs. However, the question has not specifically been addressed; consultation with legal counsel is advised before adopting a policy that denies participation by known infectious donors or the release of known infected blood units [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1596598344"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/682.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25491439"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Historical context</strong> – Interest in preoperative autologous donation (PAD) greatly expanded in response to the AIDS epidemic and then declined to the point that it is rarely if ever used. Reasons for the decline in use include the greater likelihood of transfusion when an autologous unit was donated, high rate of discarding autologous units, increasing safety of the blood supply, lower overall rate of transfusion due to patient blood management, and cost. PAD units were once crossed over into the general allogeneic donor pool, but this no longer occurs (See <a class="local">'Historical perspective'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – The most compelling indication for PAD is for an individual undergoing surgery with high likelihood of requiring transfusion who has developed alloantibodies to high frequency antigens or multiple antibodies and for whom a sufficient number of allogeneic units may not be guaranteed. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> – Exclusions from PAD include conditions that would be exacerbated by transient anemia (especially cardiovascular conditions and heart failure), and any acute infection. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Avoiding inappropriate use</strong> – Autologous blood should never be transfused simply because it is available or would otherwise be discarded. Autologous blood is not appropriate for replacing iron, promoting wound healing or general well-being, or normalizing the hemoglobin level. (See <a class="local">'Adhering to transfusion guidelines'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory testing of autologous units</strong> – Prior to issuing the unit for transfusion, ABO and RhD compatibility testing and an antibody screen are generally performed on a patient specimen; ABO group and RhD type are confirmed on the autologous unit, and crossmatch is done according to transfusion service practices. (See <a class="local">'Compatibility testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Access to PAD</strong> – PAD programs are largely the purview of blood collection centers. Patients can donate up to one unit per week, with the last unit collected two weeks prior to surgery. They should begin oral iron supplementation as soon as surgery is scheduled. Erythropoietin is rarely indicated. The donor should understand the risks and benefits and should provide informed consent; they should generally meet donation criteria for allogeneic donors. (See <a class="local">'How to access PAD'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Controversies</strong> – Several aspects of PAD remain controversial, including the extent of infectious disease testing, release of infectious units, and participation by known infectious donors. Consultation with legal counsel is advised before adopting a policy that denies release of known infected blood or participation by known infectious donors. (See <a class="local">'Controversial areas'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H698751260"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff gratefully acknowledges the extensive contributions of Arthur J.
