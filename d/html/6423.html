It is typically a self-limited condition with fever and manifestations of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy. However, KD may cause cardiovascular complications, particularly coronary artery (CA) aneurysms. These, in turn, can lead to coronary occlusion and cardiac ischemia and result in significant morbidity or even mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5772.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of CA aneurysm development and associated morbidity and mortality have dramatically decreased as a result of treatment with intravenous <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). This therapy is effective for preventing CA abnormalities, but the benefits in children who have already developed CA aneurysms are more equivocal. Thus, expeditious diagnosis and timely treatment are critical to achieve the optimal clinical outcome. The initial treatment of KD is discussed in this topic review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, cardiovascular sequelae, and treatment of refractory KD are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6408.html" rel="external">"Refractory Kawasaki disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6417.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5772.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3881491061"><span class="h1">IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR IVIG RESISTANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the diagnosis of KD has been made  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115617" href="/z/d/graphic/115617.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), the next step is to determine the risk of intravenous <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) resistance since it is associated with a higher risk of coronary artery (CA) abnormalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115933" href="/z/d/graphic/115933.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Patients who do not respond to IVIG treatment may benefit from more aggressive initial therapy for KD.</p><p>The first retrospective study to look at risk factors for refractory KD used the database of the 2003 to 2004 nationwide survey of KD in Japan [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Of the 15,940 patients with KD, 20 percent did not respond to initial <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> therapy. These nonresponders had a dramatically higher risk for CA aneurysms (odds ratio [OR] 10.38, 95% CI 6.98-15.45) and giant CA aneurysms (OR 54.06, 95% CI 12.84-227.65) compared with responders. One of the risk factors identified was initial treatment at or before the fifth day of illness (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.66-2.15). However, a review of data from the 1997 to 2004 nationwide KD surveys suggests that earlier initial treatment might have reflected more clear-cut and therefore more severe disease at presentation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Thus, the high incidence of retreatment among children initially treated before the sixth day of illness could simply support the impression that severe vasculitis requires more aggressive therapy.</p><p>No single risk factor identifies a majority of children likely to have an incomplete response to the initial dose of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>; therefore, scoring models based upon combinations of risk factors have been developed to predict initial response to IVIG therapy. Most such attempts, however, have been inadequate to use clinically, with sensitivities ranging from 86 to 33 percent and specificities from 87 to 62 percent [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. In addition, risk factors are not necessarily transferable between populations. For example, the Kobayashi score effectively identified 95 percent of Japanese children in Japan likely to respond incompletely to the initial dose of IVIG [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. When used in the United States, however, 64 percent of patients who were resistant to IVIG were not flagged as high risk by the Kobayashi score [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Three other Japanese risk scores that are sensitive and specific for identifying children in Japan at high risk of being resistant to the first dose of IVIG are similarly insensitive in American patients with KD [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3799863647"><span class="h2">Japanese children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk stratification has proven useful in identifying Japanese children treated in Japan for KD who are at high risk of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> resistance [<a href="#rid4">4,6,9</a>]. Further studies are needed to prospectively validate criteria for identifying high-risk patients in other populations [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The Japanese studies have led to the augmentation of initial therapy with glucocorticoids or other agents in certain patients at high risk for IVIG resistance (refractory KD). Extrapolating the data from Japanese children in Japan to other populations, including children of Japanese ethnicity in other countries, is increasingly common in view of the strength of the benefit in Japan [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5772.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Risk factors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6408.html" rel="external">"Refractory Kawasaki disease", section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>The risk of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> resistance in Japanese children with KD can be ascertained using the Kobayashi score  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114504" href="/z/d/graphic/114504.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] or other similar validated scores [<a href="#rid4">4,10</a>]. These scores can be used to determine which patients might benefit from augmented initial therapy. The data are strongest for the addition of glucocorticoids to initial IVIG treatment in children at high risk of failing to respond to IVIG alone. As an example, the RAISE (Randomized controlled trial to Assess Immunoglobulin plus Steroid Efficacy for Kawasaki disease) trial examined the addition of glucocorticoids to initial IVIG in children with a Kobayashi score ≥5 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In this randomized trial, 125 patients received IVIG and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/z/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12723" href="/z/d/drug information/12723.html" rel="external">prednisolone</a>, while 123 received IVIG and aspirin alone. The incidence of CA abnormalities was significantly lower in the group that received prednisolone (4 patients [3 percent] versus 28 patients [23 percent]). Serious adverse events were similar between both groups. The other risk scores have not yet been used in clinical trials for this purpose. (See <a class="local">'Additional therapy for patients at high risk for IVIG resistance'</a> below.)</p><p>The Kobayashi score includes the following risk factors [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sodium ≤133 mmol/L (2 points) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥100 int. units/L (2 points) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥10 mg/dL (≥100 mg/L) (1 point) [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neutrophils ≥80 percent of the white blood cell (WBC) count differential (2 points) [<a href="#rid4">4,11</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Platelet count ≤300,000/mm<sup>3 </sup>(1 point) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early diagnosis, with initial treatment at or before the fourth day of illness (2 points) [<a href="#rid2">2,4,6,12</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age ≤12 months (1 point) [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]</p><p></p><p>Additional risk factors for nonresponsiveness to initial <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> therapy identified in retrospective studies include recurrent episodes of KD [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], male sex [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>], and low serum albumin [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4198167999"><span class="h2">Non-Japanese children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Non-Japanese children are also at increased risk of failing to respond to initial therapy with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> alone when they fulfill risk scores (such as the Kobayashi score), but these scores have low sensitivity and poor negative predictive value outside of Japan [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In non-Japanese populations, different risk factors can identify children in whom significant CA dilatation is likely to occur despite treatment with IVIG. Extrapolating from the RAISE trial, some centers elect to treat such children with adjunct glucocorticoids because they believe that the potential benefits outweigh potential risks. It is important to stress, however, that limited data are available demonstrating that such an extrapolation is valid [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>One risk model appears to successfully predict risk factors for developing CA aneurysms despite initial treatment with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> in children in the United States with KD [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The development database retrospectively analyzed 903 patients with KD from Boston and San Diego, and the validation cohort consisted of 185 well-characterized subjects in a Pediatric Heart Network clinical trial at eight North American centers. The final score used several of the same risk factors that are central to the Japanese models, with the unique addition of enlarged CAs at presentation (Z-score &gt;2). Predictors of CA aneurysms at two to eight weeks were baseline Z-score of left anterior descending or right CA ≥2.0, age &lt;6 months, any Asian race, and CRP &gt;13 mg/dL. Each of the variables is given 1 point, except 2 points for baseline Z-score of left anterior descending or right CA &gt;2.0. Patients are grouped into low (0 to 1 points), moderate (2 points), or high (3 to 5 points) risk. The odds of developing aneurysms (Z-score &gt;2.5) two to eight weeks after onset of KD was 40-fold greater in high- than low-risk groups in the validation cohort (OR 44.0, 95% CI 10.8-180).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children with enlarged CAs at presentation, prior to </strong><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a><strong> treatment</strong> – A retrospective study of 500 children with CA aneurysms found that CA Z-scores at presentation were highly predictive of outcomes [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The suggested cutoff for initial Z-scores ranges from 2.0 to 3.0, depending upon the desired balance between minimizing unnecessary use of glucocorticoids versus minimizing development of CA aneurysms in the greatest number of children [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A subsequent retrospective study of 121 children with CA aneurysms (Z-score ≥2 to &lt;10) at the time of diagnosis who were treated with glucocorticoids plus IVIG (n = 30), <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13381" href="/z/d/drug information/13381.html" rel="external">infliximab</a> plus IVIG (n = 58), or IVIG alone (n = 33) found that children treated with glucocorticoids were 31 percent less likely to have progression of CA aneurysm size compared with IVIG alone [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In addition, no children treated with glucocorticoids needed additional treatment due to persistent fever compared with 21 percent treated with IVIG alone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Another retrospective study of 157 European children of mixed ethnic backgrounds with KD found that the presence of any echocardiographic abnormality on the initial echocardiogram (CA dilatation, CA aneurysm, pericardial effusion, perivascular brightness of the CAs, left ventricular dysfunction) was strongly associated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> resistance and development of CA lesions within the first six weeks [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. These findings are relatively subjective and difficult to quantify. Thus, further studies are needed before other echocardiogram abnormalities are included as a criterion for addition of glucocorticoids.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Young infants with KD</strong> – Children under six months of age have up to a 35 percent risk of developing CA aneurysms despite timely treatment with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>, and children from 6 to 12 months of age are also at higher risk of failing to respond to IVIG [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Young age is included in many risk scores, including the Kobayashi score, and is the most sensitive marker of increased CA risk. Accordingly, it is used by some centers as an independent indication for augmentation of initial therapy with glucocorticoids.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children with KD associated with shock</strong> – Though the literature consists mostly of case reports and case series, children with KD who present with shock are at higher risk of failing to respond to <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>. Studies have not been performed to determine whether adjuvant glucocorticoids improve CA outcomes, but they may have other benefits in nonseptic shock, such as decreasing capillary leak and other manifestations of shock [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children with KD presenting with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)</strong> – From 1 to 5 percent of patients with KD develop MAS, with cytokine storm, cytopenias, hepatic dysfunction, and risk of thrombosis. These patients have a higher rate of failing to respond to <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> and an increased mortality rate. Outcomes are poor in children with KD and MAS whose diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Thus, augmentation of initial IVIG is an attractive option even though it is not clear whether addition of glucocorticoids alone affects outcomes [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15688.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Complications", section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8384.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H110605273"><span class="h1">INITIAL THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to the treatment of patients who are diagnosed with KD is consistent with American Heart Association (AHA) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines [<a href="#rid14">14,24</a>]. The recommended initial therapy includes intravenous <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG; 2 g/kg) administered as a single infusion over 8 to 12 hours. All published guidelines also include <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/z/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> (30 to 50 mg/kg daily divided into four doses) with IVIG as initial treatment of KD  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115933" href="/z/d/graphic/115933.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>) unless it is contraindicated (see <a class="local">'Aspirin'</a> below). Risk of IVIG resistance should also be determined prior to initiating therapy (see <a class="local">'Identification of patients at high risk for IVIG resistance'</a> above). Patients who are at high risk for IVIG resistance are additionally treated with systemic glucocorticoids [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Children who meet partial criteria (incomplete KD)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711" href="/z/d/graphic/67711.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115617" href="/z/d/graphic/115617.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) are treated no differently from children who fulfill diagnostic criteria for KD. A review of almost 16,000 cases enrolled in the 17<sup>th</sup> Japanese nationwide survey of KD found that 16.1 percent of children with coronary artery (CA) abnormalities had incomplete KD, meeting fewer than five diagnostic criteria [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. A retrospective review evaluated 195 patients with KD who developed CA aneurysms at four centers in the United States from 1981 to 2006, 53 (27 percent) of whom were not treated for KD, because they did not fulfill diagnostic criteria [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Application of the 2004 AHA/AAP guidelines [<a href="#rid27">27</a>] would have resulted in the administration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> therapy to all but three of these children (98 percent).</p><p>Patients are usually observed for 24 hours (minimum 12 hours) following completion of initial <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> therapy to confirm resolution of fever. Recommendations concerning the timing of follow-up of children discharged after responding to IVIG depend upon whether CAs are normal or dilated and the patient's risk factors for ultimately failing to respond to IVIG (see <a class="local">'Monitoring for fever'</a> below). Refractory KD is defined as persistent or recurrent fever of any magnitude between 36 hours to approximately two weeks after the start of treatment and is discussed in detail separately.

IVIG has additional beneficial effects in KD, such as rapid resolution of the almost universal lymphocytic myocarditis seen in the disease. The recommended IVIG dose for treating patients who are newly diagnosed with KD is based upon the superiority of a single 2 g/kg dose in a randomized control trial compared with five daily doses of 400 mg/kg/day [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Treatment is most effective if given within the first 7 to 10 days of the illness but is still given after 10 days in patients with persistent fever, ongoing signs of systemic inflammation, and/or CA abnormalities. IVIG is given as a single infusion over 8 to 12 hours.

IVIG appears to have a generalized anti-inflammatory effect, with reduction of fever and acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen. However, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may rise further after IVIG because positively charged proteins such as immunoglobulins increase the sedimentation of red blood cells, regardless of the degree of inflammation [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Possible mechanisms by which IVIG improves outcomes in KD include modulating cytokine levels and production, augmenting T cell suppressor activity, downregulating antibody synthesis, and providing anti-idiotypic antibodies [<a href="#rid36">36-38</a>].</p><p>Cost-benefit analysis reveals that <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> treatment of KD is one of the most cost-effective medical therapies available, leading to tremendous short- and long-term savings [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h4">Efficacy and dose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/z/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> is effective in decreasing the risk of CA aneurysms. There is a dose-response effect of IVIG (the highest dose studied is 2 g/kg), but several meta-analyses have shown that CA outcomes are not affected by addition of aspirin [<a href="#rid27">27,29-34</a>].

There are no data, however, documenting effects of treating patients with doses greater than 2 g/kg. Further dose increases are limited by the cost and availability of IVIG, as well as by potential side effects. There is also concern for the large volume that is administered to patients who may not be able to tolerate the fluid load, although, in clinical practice, this has not been a significant problem in patients with KD. Also unclear is the potential for additional benefit with the prevalence rate for CA complications already reduced fivefold with IVIG standard therapy. Nevertheless, the dose response to IVIG provides the theoretical basis for the practice of IVIG retreatment of patients who have persistent or recrudescent fever after initial IVIG therapy.

Low-dose aspirin (as an antiplatelet agent) was subsequently prescribed following resolution of fever. In 128 of 162 patients (80 percent), fever resolved within 24 hours of completion of IVIG therapy. At the time of diagnosis, 10 percent of patients had CA aneurysms. Subsequent CA aneurysms formed in 3 percent of patients whose fever normalized within 24 hours of completing IVIG therapy.

The AHA and AAP guidelines recommend that IVIG be administered to children with KD within the first 10 days of illness and, if possible, within the first seven days of illness because the rate at which children with KD develop aneurysms increases significantly after the ninth day of illness. Nonetheless, IVIG should still be administered to patients with KD who present after the 10<sup>th</sup> day of illness if they have persistent fever without another explanation, aneurysms, or evidence of ongoing systemic inflammation (eg, elevated CRP or ESR) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>Two retrospective studies reported a lower incidence of cardiac sequelae and a shorter duration of clinical symptoms (eg, fever) for patients treated before day 5 or 6 of illness [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>].

The risk of hemolysis is dose related and is particularly increased in patients who receive more than one dose of IVIG. Children with non-type O blood are also at increased risk of developing significant hemolysis following IVIG therapy.</p><p>The greatest long-term concern with any blood product is the potential transmission of bloodborne pathogens. As an example, more than 100 cases of hepatitis C occurred in recipients of a single brand of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> in 1994 (none were in children with KD) [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Since that time, manufacturers have introduced a variety of elaborate sterilization procedures including lyophilization, pasteurization, and addition of solvent detergents. These are generally effective in rendering the product free of at least lipid-soluble viruses so that transmission of hepatitis C is no longer a risk. However, other pathogens, such as parvovirus, might escape neutralization by these procedures [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Other stages of the purification of IVIG may inactivate detergent-resistant viruses, and confirmed reports of transmission of viruses are rare with available preparations of IVIG [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

Several meta-analyses have shown that aspirin does not affect aneurysm formation [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. The question of whether the benefits of aspirin warrant its continued use in KD is unlikely to be answered since all prospective studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of IVIG in treating KD also employed moderate to high doses of aspirin.</p><p>The dose of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/z/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> used to achieve an anti-inflammatory effect during the acute phase of illness is relatively high, with a recommended range of 30 to 100 mg/kg per day in four divided doses [<a href="#rid1">1,27,52,53</a>]. We use 30 to 50 mg/kg per day (maximum 4 g/day), the lower end of the dose range recommended by the AHA and AAP guidelines [<a href="#rid14">14,24</a>], because higher doses have an increased potential for adverse effects without confirmed benefits. We do not hesitate to hold the aspirin for any contraindication, particularly infection with, or exposure to, varicella or influenza. Once fever has been absent for 48 hours, patients are generally switched to a low dose of aspirin, 3 to 5 mg/kg per day, for its antiplatelet effect. This low-dose aspirin regimen is continued until laboratory markers of ongoing inflammation (eg, platelet count and ESR) return to normal, unless CA abnormalities are detected by echocardiography. The antithrombotic regimen for patients with persistent CA aneurysms is reviewed in greater detail separately.

IVIG is most effective if administered within the first 10 days of illness, before aneurysms typically develop. Nonetheless, IVIG should be administered even beyond this 10-day window in patients with evidence of persistent vasculitis or systemic inflammation (eg, persistent fever, elevated acute-phase reactants). (See <a class="local">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Aspirin</strong><strong> </strong>– In patients with KD, we suggest administering <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/z/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> during the acute phase of illness (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Heart Association (AHA) have recommended a broad range of aspirin doses (30 to 100 mg/kg/day), but it is not clear that any amount of aspirin has long-term benefits. We administer a total daily aspirin dose of 30 to 50 mg/kg/day in four divided doses (maximum dose 4 g per day) but do not hesitate to hold the aspirin for any contraindication, particularly exposure to varicella or influenza. The dose of aspirin is decreased to 3 to 5 mg/kg/day 48 hours after the resolution of fever. Aspirin is continued until laboratory markers of ongoing inflammation (eg, platelet count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) return to normal, unless coronary artery (CA) abnormalities are detected by echocardiography, in which case aspirin therapy is continued. (See <a class="local">'Aspirin'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114918.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Management and prognosis", section on 'Antithrombotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional treatment in patients at increased risk of </strong><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/z/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a><strong> resistance </strong>– In children with KD who are determined to be at increased risk of IVIG resistance, we suggest adding glucocorticoids to initial IVIG therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). We typically give a total of 15 days of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12725" href="/z/d/drug information/12725.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>/<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12723" href="/z/d/drug information/12723.html" rel="external">prednisolone</a> (five days each of 2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 0.5 mg/kg), starting with an intravenous formulation and switching to oral glucocorticoids 12 to 24 hours before expected discharge.

After the baseline echocardiogram is obtained at diagnosis, echocardiography is usually repeated at approximately two and six weeks of illness to evaluate for CA involvement. Examinations and echocardiograms are repeated more frequently in children with CA abnormalities. Children also should be monitored carefully for any signs of persistent illness during the first two weeks after treatment, as those with ongoing inflammation, particularly fever of any degree, are at highest risk of developing CA abnormalities. Patients without any cardiovascular abnormalities appear to be clinically healthy at long-term follow-up (range, 10 to 21 years). However, it is unknown whether they are at increased risk for atherosclerotic heart disease. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up </strong>– Guidelines have been developed by the AHA and AAP for subsequent therapy, physical activity, and follow-up visits (schedule and content) based upon the relative risk for myocardial infarction  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113211" href="/z/d/graphic/113211.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

One exception to this postponement is in children residing in communities experiencing an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease. Another exception is children on long-term <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/z/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> therapy. We suggest that children who are ≥12 months of age and are on long-term, moderate- or high-dose aspirin therapy (30 to 100 mg/kg/day) receive the <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13006" href="/z/d/drug information/13006.html" rel="external">varicella vaccine</a> because of the increased risk of Reye syndrome (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In situations where vaccination is not postponed, the vaccine should be repeated at least 11 months after the administration of IVIG. Influenza immunization, recommended in all children over six months of age, is also particularly important in those who require long-term high-dose aspirin therapy because of the possible increased risk of Reye syndrome.
