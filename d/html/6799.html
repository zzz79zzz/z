It usually results from disruption of blood vessels in the decidua (ie, pregnancy endometrium) or from a discrete cervical or vaginal lesion. The clinician typically makes a provisional clinical diagnosis based upon the gestational age and the character of bleeding (eg, spotting, light or heavy flow, intermittent or constant, associated with pain or painless). Physical examination and laboratory and/or imaging tests are then used to support or revise the initial diagnosis. Bleeding can be associated with an adverse pregnancy outcome or an ectopic pregnancy, which can be life-threatening.</p><p>The evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding in the first half of pregnancy (ie, up to 20 weeks of gestation) are discussed here. The evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding in the second half of pregnancy (ie, 20 weeks or more of gestation) are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/140117.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and differential diagnosis of vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1357004631"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vaginal spotting or bleeding occurs in approximately 25 percent of pregnancies in the first trimester (up to 13+6 weeks [ie, 13 weeks plus 6 days of gestation]) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is much less common in the second trimester (14+0 to 27+6 weeks), occurring in one to two percent of pregnancies [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Reported incidence varies widely depending on the definition of bleeding and method of case ascertainment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2557809865"><span class="h2">Site</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The site of patient evaluation (office versus emergency department) depends upon the volume of bleeding and presence of other symptoms. Patients with heavy bleeding (eg, soaking ≥1 pad/hour for more than two hours, or passing large clots), lightheadedness/syncope, and/or pelvic pain generally warrant prompt evaluation in an emergency department so supportive measures and treatment can be rapidly initiated if the patient is found to be hemodynamically unstable. In hemodynamically unstable patients, two large bore (14 or 16 gauge) peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters are placed for IV fluids, and a hemoglobin/hematocrit level, coagulation studies, and a type and screen or crossmatch are obtained, with transfusion of blood products as needed.</p><p>Although patients with severe blood loss (ie, requiring supportive care and rapid treatment) generally have orthostatic changes (systolic blood pressure decline of ≥20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure decline of ≥10 mmHg or heart rate increase of ≥30 beats/minute present after three minutes of standing, syncope), occasionally young pregnant patients can have massive bleeding without demonstrating orthostasis. Prompt, careful assessment is important to avoid unnecessary delay in the management of such patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2453354382"><span class="h2">Goal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of the evaluation is to make a definitive diagnosis when possible and exclude the presence of serious pathology in the remaining cases  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947" href="/z/d/graphic/88947.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The actual etiology of the bleeding often cannot be determined.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">History</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Has an intrauterine pregnancy been documented?</strong> — Ectopic pregnancy is particularly important to exclude since it can be life-threatening. Thus, the first step in evaluation is to determine whether the patient has had an ultrasound examination and to review the results of that examination. Prior documentation that the pregnancy is in the normal intrauterine location immediately excludes ectopic pregnancy, although the possibility that the prior ultrasound may have missed a heterotopic pregnancy (ie, one intrauterine and one extrauterine pregnancy) or misdiagnosed an interstitial (cornual) ectopic pregnancy as intrauterine should always be considered.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If an intrauterine location of the pregnancy is in doubt, repeat the ultrasound examination. (See <a class="local">'Ultrasonography'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Are symptoms concerning for ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy loss?</strong> — The extent of bleeding should be determined: Is the patient passing blood clots or is the blood soaking through their clothes? Do they feel lightheaded? Do they have significant pelvic pain or cramping? Have they passed any tissue?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the patient answers yes to any of these questions, then ectopic pregnancy and pregnancy loss (also called miscarriage or spontaneous abortion) are much more likely diagnoses than threatened abortion, implantation bleeding, cervical and vaginal disorders (or ectropion), or cervical insufficiency (in the second trimester). However, the presence of only light, intermittent, painless bleeding does not exclude the possibility of a life-threatening underlying disorder, such as ectopic pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Are there risk factors for ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy loss?</strong> — What is the patient's medical history? A past history of ectopic pregnancy or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82282" href="/z/d/graphic/82282.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) increase the probability of this disorder, but many patients with ectopic pregnancy have no risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A history of ≥2 consecutive pregnancy losses or a condition associated with pregnancy loss (eg, chromosomal translocation in either parent, maternal antiphospholipid syndrome, uterine anomaly) increases the likelihood that bleeding is related to pregnancy loss. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the patient say that they don't "feel pregnant" anymore?</strong> — Patients with a pregnancy loss may notice that symptoms associated with early pregnancy (eg, nausea, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, fatigue) have abated and they do not "feel pregnant" anymore. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Has the patient had a prior cesarean birth?</strong> — In patients with a prior cesarean birth, a subsequent pregnancy may implant in the area of the uterine scar. This is termed cesarean scar pregnancy and can only be diagnosed by ultrasound examination. Diagnosis is important as it is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. (See <a class="local">'Cesarean scar pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Focused physical examination</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Examine any tissue that has been passed</strong> — Any tissue the patient has passed vaginally should be examined. Patients may mistake blood clot for the products of conception. Passage of blood clot alone is not diagnostic of any disorder whereas a gestational sac/fetal membranes, fronds indicative of placental villi, or an intact embryo/fetus are diagnostic of a partial or complete pregnancy loss. Products of conception, if present, should be visible upon careful examination. Visualization of villi can be facilitated by rinsing the specimen to clear away blood clot and then floating it in water  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78715 graphicRef61424" href="/z/d/graphic/78715.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>). (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Examine the abdomen</strong> — An abdominal examination should be performed before the internal examination. It is best to begin by examining the quadrant of the abdomen where the patient is experiencing the least pain and then moving toward the painful area. Gentle percussion is preferable to deep palpation since it causes less pain and guarding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Midline pain is more consistent with pregnancy loss, while lateral pain is more consistent with ectopic pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below and <a class="local">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nongynecologic causes of pain should also be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4807.html" rel="external">"Approach to acute abdominal/pelvic pain in pregnant and postpartum patients", section on 'Medical-surgical causes of acute abdominal pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2342197885"><span class="h2">Check for embryonic/fetal cardiac activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Presence of embryonic/fetal cardiac activity<strong> </strong>is reassuring, as it indicates bleeding is not related to embryonic/fetal demise and highly unlikely to be related to an ectopic pregnancy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If bedside ultrasound is available, absence of previously documented embryonic/fetal cardiac activity is diagnostic of pregnancy loss. In the absence of a previous ultrasound, pregnancy failure can be diagnosed in the absence of embryonic/fetal cardiac activity when the crown-rump length is ≥7 mm or mean gestational sac diameter is ≥25 mm. Ultrasound diagnosis of pregnancy loss very early in gestation can be complicated and is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130879.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Ultrasound diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the pregnancy is ≥10 to 12 weeks of gestation, a handheld Doppler ultrasound device can be used to check for a fetal heartbeat. The fetal heart rate usually can be easily distinguished from the maternal heart rate since it is typically in the range of 110 to 160 beats per minute; however, the difference in fetal and maternal heart rates can be minimal if the mother has tachycardia and/or the embryo/fetus has bradycardia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Inability to detect fetal heart motion by handheld Doppler device, particularly in the first trimester, may merely reflect the difficulty in blindly finding the location of the embryo/fetus.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3069900722"><span class="h2">Speculum examination</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Does the vagina contain tissue or blood clot?</strong> — A speculum is inserted into the vagina to assess the volume and source of bleeding. If blood clots, products of conception, or both are present, they can be removed with gauze sponges on a sponge forceps. This tissue is examined for a gestational sac/fetal membranes, fronds indicative of placental villi, or an intact embryo/fetus and, by convention, sent for pathologic examination to confirm the presence of products of conception, which are diagnostic of pregnancy loss, and to exclude gestational trophoblastic disease. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below and <a class="local">'Gestational trophoblastic disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The utility of routine histopathological examination is questionable, as it rarely suggests the underlying cause of the pregnancy failure or establishes a diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, pathologists can sometimes diagnose entities that are the probable cause of the loss or associated with recurrent loss. These include massive chronic intervillositis, massive intervillous fibrin deposition, maternal vasculitis, findings suggestive of some fetal chromosomal anomalies (eg, triploidy, some trisomies), and septic abortion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Can the source of bleeding be seen?</strong> — Speculum examination usually confirms that the uterus is the source of bleeding but may reveal a vaginal or cervical source unrelated to pregnancy; in such cases, further evaluation depends upon the nature of the abnormality. (See <a class="local">'Cervical and vaginal disorders'</a> below and <a class="local">'Ectropion'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If no blood is seen in the vagina, then the bleeding is either resolved, occurring intermittently, or from a nongenital tract source (eg, hemorrhoids).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Is the internal cervical os dilated? </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>First trimester</strong> – Visualization of the internal cervical os is possible in some cases and if dilated, raises concern that a complete or incomplete pregnancy loss has occurred. Cramping is typically present when the cervix is open. Direct visualization of the gestational sac in a dilated internal cervical os is generally sufficient to conclude that early pregnancy loss is occurring. An open internal cervical os will admit a small instrument, such as a cotton-tipped swab. Ultrasound can provide additional information in these cases, such as whether there are retained products of conception or the unexpected presence of a twin pregnancy with a second viable gestational sac. Therefore, it is prudent to not inform patients that the pregnancy has been lost until ultrasound findings are available and the diagnosis is confirmed. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A closed internal cervical os is not diagnostic of any pregnancy disorder and can be consistent with ectopic pregnancy, threatened abortion, implantation bleeding, and other intrauterine pathologies. If the internal cervical os appears closed and there are no obvious vaginal or cervical bleeding lesions, the speculum is removed and a bimanual pelvic examination is performed. (See <a class="local">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Threatened abortion'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physiologic or implantation bleeding'</a> below and <a class="local">'Vanishing twin'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In contrast to the internal os, an open external cervical os is usually not helpful diagnostically because it can be a normal finding, especially in parous patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Second trimester</strong> – A dilated internal cervical os with painful cramps/contractions in the second trimester suggests pregnancy loss. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">By comparison, painless cervical dilation and/or effacement (thinning) in the second trimester suggests cervical insufficiency. The fetal membranes may be prolapsed or ruptured. Uterine cramps/contractions are absent or weak and irregular. (See <a class="local">'Cervical insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2603987921"><span class="h2">Pelvic examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If findings on speculum examination do not lead to a specific diagnosis, the clinician should determine whether uterine size is appropriate for the estimated gestational age. The size-gestational age correlation is learned by experience and is often described in terms of fruit (eg, 6- to 8-week size = small pear, 8- to 10-week size = orange, 10- to 12-week size = grapefruit). The uterus remains a pelvic organ until approximately 12 weeks of gestation, when it becomes sufficiently large to palpate transabdominally just above the symphysis pubis. The normal uterus is nontender, smooth, and firm.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uterus large for dates</strong> – Uterine size larger than expected for dates suggests a multiple gestation; gestational trophoblastic disease; other uterine pathology (fibroids often cause irregular uterine enlargement and may cause pain/tenderness); or incorrect dating. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6821.html" rel="external">"Twin pregnancy: Overview"</a> and <a class="local">'Gestational trophoblastic disease'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5486.html" rel="external">"Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uterus small for dates</strong> – Uterine size smaller than expected for dates suggests loss of an intrauterine pregnancy (see <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> below and <a class="local">'Vanishing twin'</a> below), ectopic pregnancy (see <a class="local">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> below), or incorrect dating. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other findings</strong> – With an ectopic pregnancy, findings on pelvic examination may include adnexal, cervical motion, or abdominal tenderness; an adnexal mass; and mild uterine enlargement; however, the physical examination is often unremarkable in a patient with a small, unruptured ectopic pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>One review of data from observational studies concluded that ultrasound examination and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration (both discussed below) could replace pelvic examination in the initial evaluation of patients with early pregnancy bleeding [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, some diagnoses will be missed with this approach (eg, bleeding from cervical or vaginal lesions), this combination of tests may not distinguish between a complete pregnancy loss and an ectopic pregnancy (both will have an empty uterus and positive hCG), and the additional cost of these tests can be avoided in some patients. For example, in bleeding patients in whom sonography has previously confirmed a viable singleton intrauterine pregnancy, another examination is not necessary to exclude ectopic pregnancy or to confirm embryonic/fetal viability if embryonic/fetal heart motion can be detected by a handheld Doppler device. Additionally, there is no value in checking the hCG concentration once the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy has been established sonographically (eg, presence of an intrauterine gestational sac containing a yolk sac or fetus).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Ultrasonography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ultrasonography is the cornerstone of the evaluation of bleeding in pregnancy. It is most useful in bleeding patients with a positive pregnancy test in whom an intrauterine pregnancy has not been previously confirmed by imaging studies. In these patients, ultrasound examination is performed to determine whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine (ectopic) and, if intrauterine, whether embryonic/fetal cardiac activity present. The possibility of heterotopic pregnancy should always be considered. (See <a class="local">'Heterotopic pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>Transabdominal ultrasound is performed initially and findings may be diagnostic. At very early gestational ages, transvaginal ultrasound allows for earlier and more reliable detection of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy and is more sensitive for detecting embryonic/fetal cardiac activity compared with transabdominal ultrasound, but the latter is useful for assessing free fluid in the abdomen (eg, bleeding from an ectopic pregnancy) and abnormalities beyond the field of view of a high-frequency vaginal probe. </p><p>It is important to note that the absence of an intrauterine gestational sac on ultrasound examination is highly suggestive of ectopic pregnancy if more than 5.5 to 6 weeks have elapsed since the first day of the patient's last normal menstrual period  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83304" href="/z/d/graphic/83304.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). At earlier gestational ages, however, an intrauterine pregnancy may be present, but not yet identifiable, even by transvaginal ultrasound. In a patient with a positive pregnancy test and a transvaginal ultrasound that shows neither an intrauterine pregnancy nor an ectopic pregnancy (ie, pregnancy of unknown location), serum hCG is tested serially to determine the rate of rise. Ultrasound findings, absolute hCG level, and change in hCG level over time are correlated until a final diagnosis (ie, live intrauterine pregnancy, early pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy) is possible. This is described in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5439.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Terminology, risk factors, and etiology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5487.html" rel="external">"Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/134770.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with pregnancy of unknown location"</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, ultrasound examination reveals unusual causes of vaginal bleeding, such as gestational trophoblastic disease or loss of one fetus from a multiple gestation.

The goal of the evaluation is to make a definitive diagnosis when possible and exclude the presence of serious pathology in the remaining cases  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947" href="/z/d/graphic/88947.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Incidence'</a> above and <a class="local">'Goal'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology</strong> – Vaginal bleeding in the first half of pregnancy may be related to:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ectopic pregnancy (See <a class="local">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pregnancy loss (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Threatened abortion (See <a class="local">'Threatened abortion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cervical, vaginal, or uterine pathology (See <a class="local">'Cervical and vaginal disorders'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ectropion'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cervical insufficiency'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cervical pregnancy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Gestational trophoblastic disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Physiologic bleeding (ie, related to implantation of the pregnancy) (See <a class="local">'Physiologic or implantation bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation </strong>– Evaluation consists of a focused history and physical examination (bimanual and speculum), and often ultrasound examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947" href="/z/d/graphic/88947.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Exclude ectopic pregnancy</strong> – An important goal in the evaluation of patients with bleeding in early pregnancy is to rule out the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, since ruptured ectopic pregnancy can result in severe hemorrhage and death. Sonographic confirmation of an intrauterine pregnancy excludes ectopic pregnancy, except in rare cases of heterotopic pregnancy, which should be considered, especially in patients who conceive by assisted reproductive technology (ART). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Heterotopic pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Examine any tissue that has been passed</strong> – Products of conception, if present in tissue the patient has passed vaginally, should be visible upon careful examination and are diagnostic of a partial or complete pregnancy loss. Visualization of villi can be facilitated by rinsing the specimen to clear away blood clot and then floating it in water  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78715 graphicRef61424" href="/z/d/graphic/78715.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>). (See <a class="local">'Focused physical examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Speculum examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pregnancy loss'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Check for embryonic/fetal cardiac activity</strong> – Handheld Doppler or ultrasound confirmation of embryonic/fetal cardiac activity is reassuring, as it indicates bleeding is not related to embryonic/fetal demise. (See <a class="local">'Check for embryonic/fetal cardiac activity'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Examine the vagina and cervix</strong> – Speculum examination usually confirms that the uterus is the source of bleeding but may reveal a vaginal or cervical source unrelated to pregnancy; in such cases, further evaluation depends upon the nature of the abnormality. If no blood is seen in the vagina, then the bleeding is either resolved, occurring intermittently, or from a nongenital tract source (eg, hemorrhoids). (See <a class="local">'Speculum examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pelvic examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnoses identifiable on speculum examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Direct visualization of the gestational sac in a dilated internal cervical os in a patient with bleeding and/or pain is generally sufficient to conclude that pregnancy loss is occurring. In contrast, in the second trimester, cervical dilation and/or effacement (possibly with prolapsed fetal membranes) that is painless or associated with only mild discomfort in the lower abdomen or back suggests cervical insufficiency. (See <a class="local">'Speculum examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cervical insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnoses of exclusion</strong> – Threatened abortion and implantation bleeding are diagnoses of exclusion in patients with vaginal bleeding, a closed cervix, and sonographic visualization of an intrauterine pregnancy with detectable embryonic/fetal cardiac activity.
