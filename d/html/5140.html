(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>DM1 results from an expansion of a cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) trinucleotide repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of the DM1 protein kinase (<em>DMPK</em>) gene. DM2 is caused by an expansion of a cytosine-cytosine-thymine-guanine (CCTG) tetranucleotide repeat located in intron 1 of the CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein (<em>CNBP</em>, also known as <em>ZNF9</em>) gene. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of DM can usually be made clinically in a patient with the characteristic presentation and a positive family history. Genetic testing for an expanded CTG repeat in the <em>DMPK</em> gene is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of DM1. Testing for the CCTG repeat in the <em>ZNF9</em> (<em>CNBP</em>) gene is appropriate if DM1 testing is negative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3404313784"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT AND DM PHENOTYPE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>DM1 and DM2 are multisystem disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and myotonia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, cataracts, and other abnormalities. However, the age of onset, presentation, and severity and progression of symptoms vary according to DM phenotype. There are congenital, childhood, classic (adult-onset), and mild forms of DM1, whereas only an adult-onset form of DM2 is recognized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Phenotypes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Certain aspects of management differ according to phenotype, as outlined in the sections that follow.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2624714493"><span class="h2">Congenital DM1</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants with congenital DM1 often present with respiratory and feeding difficulties and may require neonatal intensive care and ventilatory support. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Congenital DM1'</a>.)</p><p>Respiratory involvement is the leading cause of death in the neonatal period. Need for support longer than four weeks usually indicates a poor prognosis for survival, and the mortality rate exceeds 25 percent [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP) can facilitate weaning infants with DM1 from endotracheal mechanical ventilation and minimize morbidity associated with prolonged intubation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Because feeding difficulties are common during the first two years of life, children with congenital DM1 are at increased risk for aspiration and may benefit from feeding evaluation. Survivors usually are able to suck and swallow adequately for oral nutrition by 8 to 12 weeks of age [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, gastrostomy tube insertion is often necessary during the first six months of life to maintain nutrition and prevent aspiration pneumonia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3512475463"><span class="h2">Childhood DM1</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The childhood (juvenile) form of DM1 typically presents before the age of 10 years with cognitive and behavioral problems. Over time, affected children develop muscle symptoms and disability that is similar to severe adult-onset classic DM1. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Childhood DM1'</a>.)</p><p>Cognitive and psychosocial assessments are important aspects of management [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Special education, psychotherapy, social support, and vocational skills training can help to improve function, although there are no high-quality trials evaluating these approaches. In some cases, pharmacotherapy for issues such as attention deficit disorder, anxiety, or mood disorders may be beneficial.</p><p>Management of childhood DM1 is otherwise similar to that of classic (adult-onset) DM1, including routine surveillance for and treatment of the multiple neurologic and systemic manifestations, such as progressive muscle weakness, cardiac abnormalities, dysphagia, respiratory involvement, and sleep disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401" href="/d/graphic/101401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1495153568"><span class="h2">Classic DM1</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The classic form of DM1 becomes symptomatic during the second to fourth decade of life. Major clinical manifestations include (but are not limited to) skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Multidisciplinary surveillance and management of these and other issues is optimal  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401" href="/d/graphic/101401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); specific issues are outlined below. (See <a class="local">'Specific management issues'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H768194175"><span class="h2">Mild DM1</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mild form of DM1 is characterized by mild weakness, myotonia, and cataracts. Onset is usually after age 40 years. Though generally not debilitating, surveillance for cataracts and potentially serious manifestations of DM1, such as cardiac conduction abnormalities, is advisable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H716164758"><span class="h2">DM2</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The onset of DM2 ranges from the second to the seventh decades, and the condition often presents with prominent muscle pain, myotonia, weakness, or cataracts. In most cases, proximal muscle weakness predominates, particularly involving the hip girdle muscles. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'DM2'</a>.)</p><p>Although DM2 generally is less severe than classic DM1, it can progress to disability and is associated with an increased risk of cardiac conduction disease and other serious complications. Therefore, management is similar to that of classic DM1  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401" href="/d/graphic/101401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3382880566"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no disease-modifying therapy available for the treatment of DM. Thus, treatment is symptomatic. The systemic (non-neuromuscular) manifestations of DM are the most treatable aspects of the disease. A number of tests and evaluations are useful in the surveillance and management of patients with DM1 and DM2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401" href="/d/graphic/101401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Because the disease is multifaceted and variable, its management requires an interdisciplinary approach among health professionals and involves many different skills and services from community resources [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Recommendations regarding management are based more on consensus and clinical experience than on evidence from randomized controlled trials.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Muscle involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The natural history of DM1 is that of gradual progression in weakness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Skeletal muscle weakness'</a>.)</p><p>The management of physical disability depends on the distribution and severity of muscle weakness and is best provided by a multidisciplinary team including neurologists, physiatrists, and occupational and physical therapists. Consensus-based care guidelines recommend annual evaluation for mobility, balance, and falls; activities of daily life, including self-care; and activities in home, school, work, and community [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Initially, molded ankle-foot orthoses are helpful in preventing foot-drop and enhancing gait stability. Over time, patients may find that a walker is necessary to navigate distances with confidence and safety, and in the later stages of the illness, a wheelchair may be required, especially for longer distances outside of the home. Accordingly, the sequential and often combined use of ankle-foot orthoses, walkers, and wheelchairs in concert with multidisciplinary interventions (addressing the compromised vision, fatigue, and visuospatial deficits of patients with DM1) are important in maintaining health and safety in these patients.</p><p>Neck muscle weakness is common in DM1, affecting both flexor and extensor groups, and tends to cause head-drop; this symptom may be ameliorated by a fitted collar. Eye lid crutches or blepharoplasty may be helpful for troublesome ptosis encountered in DM1.</p><p>In DM2, progression and severity of weakness are less pronounced than in DM1. When necessary, the assistive devices described for DM1 are likely to be helpful.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Exercise training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Moderate-intensity strength training for DM1 has been assessed in only a few small randomized trials [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. There was no clear evidence of benefit or harm [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>A smaller study on the effects of aerobic training in 12 patients with DM1 for 12 weeks on a cycle ergometer noted that patients increased maximal oxygen uptake by 14 percent and increased maximal workload by 11 percent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, 5 of 17 patients who were originally enrolled dropped out of the study because of low compliance, and 3 of the 12 who completed the study did not follow the original training schedule. Thus, such approaches to fitness are likely to be most appropriate for a relatively small subset of patients with DM1 who exercise under supervision.</p><p>In the absence of evidence that exercise is effective for improving muscle strength, we suggest that patients with DM engage in low-intensity exercise, to the extent that they are capable and without undue physical stress. We also suggest that exercise include gentle stretching actions at selected joints, such as dorsiflexion at the ankles, extension at the knees, and abduction at the hips, which may attenuate the tendency for tendon shortening and joint contractures. This recommendation is based upon the intuitive sense that stretching and exercise may be systemically beneficial, and upon evidence that low-intensity exercise is not harmful.</p><p>Since exercise can precipitate serious arrhythmias, some have suggested exercise testing with electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring as part of the routine evaluation of young patients with DM1 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Congestive heart failure has also been reported in a young DM1 patient following daily excessive physical activity [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. We suggest exercise testing with ECG monitoring prior to beginning an exercise training program in patients with DM1. In patients with cardiac symptoms or abnormal regular or stress test ECG, a decision regarding the safety of exercise training should be made by a cardiologist. Cardiology consultation is also recommended in adults with DM1 or DM2 prior to beginning an exercise program.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1368179436"><span class="h3">Muscle pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In DM2, muscle pain can be a persistent and troubling symptom and is often a presenting manifestation of the disease. Muscle pain may also affect some patients with DM1. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Muscle pain'</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacologic agents that may be effective for this problem include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a>, tricyclic antidepressants, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9648" href="/d/drug information/9648.html" rel="external">mexiletine</a>, and low-dose glucocorticoids, such as oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 5 mg on alternate days [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. We begin management with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">naproxen</a> as needed, along with gabapentin up to 300 mg three times per day.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1164134765"><span class="h3">Myotonia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms of myotonia in patients with DM1 can be sufficiently pronounced to prompt treatment. Myotonic symptoms in DM2 are less likely to require therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Muscle pain'</a>.)</p><p>For adults with myotonic symptoms that require treatment (typically in DM1), we suggest initial therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9648" href="/d/drug information/9648.html" rel="external">mexiletine</a> 450 mg daily in three divided doses. In children and adolescents, in whom myotonia may occasionally need to be treated, mexiletine (1.5 to 3.0 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours) may be used with careful follow-up. Because of the rare proarrhythmic effects of mexiletine in those with underlying ventricular arrhythmias, it is best to obtain a cardiology consultation before beginning therapy with mexiletine, particularly for patients with DM1 who have current or remote cardiac symptoms or for those with an abnormal baseline ECG [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Mexiletine is contraindicated in patients with second- and third-degree heart block. Ataxia, coordination abnormalities, and dizziness are relatively common side effects, and ongoing hematologic, liver function, and cardiac monitoring must be performed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86747.html" rel="external">"Major side effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs"</a>.)</p><p>The clinical experience of treating myotonia has involved a variety of medications, including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9769" href="/d/drug information/9769.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9648" href="/d/drug information/9648.html" rel="external">mexiletine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9813" href="/d/drug information/9813.html" rel="external">procainamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9821" href="/d/drug information/9821.html" rel="external">propafenone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8449" href="/d/drug information/8449.html" rel="external">flecainide</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9198" href="/d/drug information/9198.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a>, all of which are sodium channel blockers and share the potential to increase weakness while reducing myotonia [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. However, there are few high-quality data:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In several small, double-blind, randomized controlled trials involving patients with DM1, treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9648" href="/d/drug information/9648.html" rel="external">mexiletine</a> (at either 450 mg or 600 mg daily, given in three divided doses) was superior to placebo for improvement in grip relaxation time [<a href="#rid16">16,19</a>]. Mexiletine was well tolerated in these trials and was not associated with any serious adverse effects or cardiac conduction abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An earlier systematic review published in 2006 found 10 small randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of 12 different treatments for myotonia in patients with DM and other myotonic disorders [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, the quality of the trials was generally poor, and a meta-analysis was not possible.</p><p></p><p>Historically, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9847" href="/d/drug information/9847.html" rel="external">quinine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9813" href="/d/drug information/9813.html" rel="external">procainamide</a> were used to treat myotonia, but their use is no longer recommended because they exhibit adverse effects on cardiac conduction, to which patients with DM may be especially vulnerable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H633369788"><span class="h2">Cardiac disturbances</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cardiac conduction disturbances and tachyarrhythmias occur in DM1, and to a lesser extent in DM2. In some instances, cardiac arrhythmias may occur as a very early manifestation of the disease. More details on the specific cardiac abnormalities and their clinical manifestations are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Cardiac abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>We typically refer our patients to a cardiologist for ongoing care and follow-up, in parallel with neurology clinic visits. Significant cardiac involvement is often asymptomatic. In accord with 2017 guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA), we recommend a careful cardiac history (seeking evidence for palpitations, blackouts, syncope, and dyspnea), examination (ascertainment for bradyarrhythmia, ectopic beats, mitral valve prolapse, and atrial fibrillation), ECG, echocardiography, and ambulatory ECG monitoring at the time of DM diagnosis, regardless of symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401" href="/d/graphic/101401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Patients with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction should be reevaluated yearly by examination, ECG, and ambulatory ECG monitoring, and every two to four years by echocardiography.</p><p>Patients with palpitations, dizziness, syncope, non-sinus rhythm, PR interval &gt;240 msec, QRS duration &gt;120 msec, or second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block should be evaluated at least annually and also considered for invasive electrophysiology study in anticipation of possible pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. Permanent pacemaker placement is indicated for most patients with second- and third-degree AV block and all patients with symptoms related to the resulting bradycardia.

However, this remains somewhat controversial, primarily because available data are limited. One of the largest studies was a retrospective analysis of 486 adults from the DM1 Heart Registry who had a PR interval &gt;200 msec or a QRS duration &gt;100 msec or both [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The study compared 341 patients who were treated with an invasive strategy (electrophysiologic study and permanent pacemaker if the interval from the His bundle to the right ventricle [HV interval] was &gt;70 msec) with 145 patients who had noninvasive management. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a trend toward longer nine-year survival in the invasive compared with the noninvasive group (77 versus 70 percent), but the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.47-1.16). However, in several different analyses that adjusted for between-group differences in baseline characteristics, the longer survival associated with the invasive strategy was statistically significant, with adjusted HRs ranging from 0.47 (95% CI 0.26-0.84) to 0.61 (95% CI 0.38-0.99). This finding was mainly due to a significantly lower incidence of sudden death associated with the invasive strategy.

The hypersomnia of DM1 may be aggravated by alveolar hypoventilation and the sleep apnea syndrome but is not entirely reversed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) management [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Thus, it is critical to assess the quality of sleep in patients with DM1, probing for whether there is nocturnal restlessness, unexplained awakenings, and loud snoring punctuated by occasional awakenings and gasping for breath, all of which should suggest the presence of a sleep-related respiratory disorder and lead to further study with a polysomnographic evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401" href="/d/graphic/101401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) that will reveal a more specific diagnosis [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Patients with DM who have sleep apnea may present with only daytime sleepiness and occasionally orthopnea, perhaps due to diaphragm weakness [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].

Bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) is better tolerated by patients with weakness of the chest wall and diaphragm who cannot overcome expiratory forces. NIPPV may also be used symptomatically during the day to rest weak respiratory muscles and to improve dyspnea. In rare instances, the progressive loss of respiratory drive and the increasing severity of diaphragm and chest wall muscle weakness creates a situation in which NIPPV no longer provides adequate respiratory support and tracheostomy may be considered.</p><p>Children with childhood (juvenile) DM may not be able to cooperate for reliable pulmonary function testing. However, most adolescent patients can be tested, and a baseline FVC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurement is suggested for adolescent patients. Periodic testing is not needed for most pediatric patients with DM1, but we suggest annual or twice yearly pulmonary tests in adolescents with dyspnea or reduced baseline FVC and/or FEV1 values.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The other notable difference between DM1 and DM2 is the behavior of the repeat size, which tends to contract when passed to the next generation in DM2 families (and tends to expand in DM1 transmissions), and then increases as the individual ages. However, there is no maternal or paternal predilection in DM2 for repeat size contraction or expansion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>As in DM1, prenatal testing for pregnancies at 50 percent risk for DM2 is possible when the presence of a mutation has been confirmed in an affected parent. However, such testing is not commonly done for a condition like DM2 that typically has an adult onset and does not have a major impact on the intellect.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3703186602"><span class="h2">Pregnancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with DM1 have an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and prolonged labor due to poor uterine contraction.

Respiratory and cardiac diseases are the most common causes of death. Younger age of onset, more severe muscle weakness, and cardiac arrhythmia may be associated with an increased risk of death.</p><p>In the DM2 population, the absence of a congenital form, the lack of association with any developmental abnormalities or severe childhood symptoms, and the relatively mild extramuscular manifestations (compared with DM1) suggest that life expectancy is unlikely to be compromised to the extent that it may be in patients with classic DM1.</p><p>The reduced life expectancy associated with DM1 is illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 115 patients with congenital DM1, life-table data suggested that the likelihood of death before 18 months of age was 25 percent, while the likelihood of survival into the mid-thirties was 50 percent [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].

The overall mean age at death was 53 years. Using age-matched general population mortality rates as a comparator, the standardized mortality ratio (a ratio of observed to expected deaths) for those with DM was significantly increased to 7.3 (95% CI 5.8-9.1).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another longitudinal study of 408 patients with DM1 who were followed for a mean of 5.7 years, there were 81 deaths (20 percent), and the mean age at death was 54 years [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. The most common cause of death, affecting 32 of 81 patients (40 percent), was progressive neuromuscular respiratory failure. Twenty-seven patients (33 percent) died suddenly. Independent risk factors for sudden death were severe conduction system abnormality on baseline electrocardiogram (ECG; relative risk [RR] 3.3, 95% CI 1.24-8.78) and a clinical diagnosis of atrial tachyarrhythmia (RR 5.18, 95% CI 2.28-11.77).

The age of onset, presentation, and severity and progression of symptoms vary according to DM phenotype. No disease-modifying therapy is available, and treatment is symptomatic. (See <a class="local">'Management and DM phenotype'</a> above and <a class="local">'Specific management issues'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Depending to some degree upon the phenotype, most patients with DM1 and DM2 may need cardiac evaluations for arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy; forced vital capacity (FVC) for respiratory muscle weakness; polysomnography for sleep disorders; ophthalmologic examination for cataracts; swallowing assessment for dysphagia; cognitive and psychosocial assessments for intellectual, attentional, and psychiatric disorders; and endocrine testing for diabetes and hypothyroidism  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401" href="/d/graphic/101401.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Infants with congenital DM1 often present with respiratory and feeding difficulties and may require neonatal intensive care and ventilatory support. Neonates and children with congenital DM1 are at increased risk for aspiration and may require a feeding evaluation and gastrostomy tube feeding. (See <a class="local">'Congenital DM1'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The childhood (juvenile) form of DM1 typically presents with cognitive and behavioral problems. Cognitive and psychosocial assessments and interventions are important aspects of management, which is otherwise similar to that of classic DM1. (See <a class="local">'Childhood DM1'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the classic (adult-onset) form of DM1, clinical manifestations include (but are not limited to) skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Multidisciplinary management is optimal. (See <a class="local">'Classic DM1'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The mild form of DM1 is generally not debilitating, but surveillance for cataracts and potentially serious manifestations of DM1, such as cardiac conduction abnormalities, is advisable. (See <a class="local">'Mild DM1'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>DM2 generally is less severe than classic DM1 but can progress to disability and is associated with an increased risk of cardiac conduction disease and other serious complications. Management is similar to that of classic DM1. (See <a class="local">'DM2'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Management of physical disability may involve the use of assistive devices. For adolescent and adult patients with DM1 and adults with DM2 who are able to participate, have a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), and are free from cardiac symptoms, we suggest low-intensity exercise training as tolerated and without undue physical stress (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with cardiac symptoms or an abnormal baseline ECG, we suggest exercise testing with ECG monitoring prior to beginning an exercise training program, since exercise can trigger arrhythmias. In this group of patients, a decision regarding the safety of exercise training should be made by a cardiologist. (See <a class="local">'Muscle involvement'</a> above and <a class="local">'Exercise training'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For occasional adult patients who have severe myotonia that interferes with function, we suggest initial therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9648" href="/d/drug information/9648.html" rel="external">mexiletine</a> 450 or 600 mg daily in three divided doses (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For children with severe myotonia, we suggest oral mexiletine 1.5 to 3.0 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Adults and children should have a cardiology evaluation for risk assessment before starting treatment with mexiletine. (See <a class="local">'Myotonia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For adult patients with DM1 and severe EDS, we suggest a trial of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10157" href="/d/drug information/10157.html" rel="external">modafinil</a> (200 mg twice daily) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>).
