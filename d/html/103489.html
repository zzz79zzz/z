         The number of patients awaiting kidney transplantation has increased over time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The increased use of organs from living donors is one strategy that addresses the need for transplants. However, despite the urgent need for living donors, 2018 marked the first substantial increase in living kidney donation in the United States after more than a decade of declining or stagnant living donor transplant rates [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], and growth was hampered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertain risks or inadequate risk mitigation can pose one barrier to increasing opportunities for living donation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Sex imbalances in rates of living donation are well described. In the United States, more than half of living donors are females, and disparities are higher when considered in terms of base population rate: 30 per million population (pmp) in females versus 19 pmp in males [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In one study, although donation declined in both males and females in lower income levels over the study period, the decline was larger among males and spanned all but the highest income levels [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], suggesting that concern for financial impact may affect donation rates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recipients of allografts from living donors receive a significant graft survival advantage over those who receive deceased-donor grafts. In addition, living-donor transplants may be performed with minimal delay and controlled scheduling, providing opportunity for preemptive transplantation (transplantation prior to dialysis) or transplantation early in a recipient's course of kidney failure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7302.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney transplantation in adults: Risk factors for graft failure"

          "Kidney transplantation in adults: Timing of transplantation and issues related to dialysis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, donor nephrectomy exposes the donor to risks associated with surgery. In addition, some studies have suggested that living kidney donation may confer small but measurable increases in the risks of hypertension, preeclampsia, gout, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
        </p>
        <p>
         In February 2013, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) implemented policy requirements for all living kidney donor recovery hospitals in the United States in order to promote consistency in the informed consent, medical and psychosocial evaluation, and follow-up of living donors [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In 2014, these requirements were incorporated within global policies for living donors. These policies define the minimum general and kidney-specific requirements for the evaluation and acceptance of living kidney donor candidates. These requirements are generally expanded upon at individual transplant programs, based on local experience or clinical practice guidelines [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], and may be tailored for individual donor characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risks associated with living kidney donation are discussed in this topic review. The evaluation of a living kidney donor candidate, including the OPTN requirements, is discussed elsewhere (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7315.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney transplantation in adults: Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate"
         </a>
         ). The evaluation of the kidney transplant recipient is discussed separately. (See

         The complications from kidney donation can be divided into those arising immediately from the nephrectomy surgery and those that may emerge many years after the kidney was donated. There are also risks associated with the evaluation itself, chiefly including the risks of discovery (such as misattributed paternity, health conditions that could have implications for insurance, and reportable infections).

         The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) policy defines minimum requirements for elements that must be discussed and documented in the informed consent of living donors [

         Based on integration of national United States donor registry data from 2008 to 2012 with administrative records from a consortium of 98 academic hospitals, one study found that 16.8 percent of donors experienced a diagnosis or procedure for a perioperative complication, most commonly gastrointestinal (4.4 percent), bleeding (3 percent), respiratory (2.5 percent), and surgical/anesthesia-related injuries (2.4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, major complications affected only 2.5 percent of donors. After adjustment for demographic, clinical (including comorbidities), procedure, and center factors, compared with White donors, Black donors had a 26 percent increased risk of experiencing any complication and a 56 percent increased risk of experiencing major complications. Other significant correlates of major complications included obesity, predonation blood disorders, psychiatric conditions, and robotic nephrectomy, while greater annual hospital volume predicted lower risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgical mortality with living kidney donation is very low. In one study of over 80,000 living kidney donors, 90-day mortality was 3.1 per 10,000 donors, a rate that was unchanged over 15 years (1994 to 2009) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         To reduce the risk for perioperative thromboembolism, some centers require females to discontinue hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy four to six weeks prior to donor nephrectomy. Estrogen-containing intrauterine devices and vaginal rings should be removed six weeks prior to surgery since they also carry a risk of thromboembolism. Low-dose progesterone-only (&lt;30 mcg of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="104542" href="/z/d/drug information/104542.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ) medications or intrauterine devices may be continued since available data do not support an increased risk for thrombosis with use of these agents.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most living-donor nephrectomies are performed laparoscopically versus an open approach. Surgical approaches to living-donor nephrectomy are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Studies suggest that, beyond the perioperative period, survival after living kidney donation is the same as for similar matched individuals who did not donate, at least over approximately 10 to 18 years [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-12
         </a>
         ], including one study of donors older than 55 years [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. However, long-term follow-up data are limited [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one long-term study of more than 80,000 living kidney donors, the risk of death over a median 6.3 years of follow-up (maximum 12 years) was the same for kidney donors and demographically matched, healthy National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III participants screened for baseline good health, including among subgroups stratified by race [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study comparing 2028 living kidney donors in Ontario, Canada (1992 to 2009) with 20,280 healthy, demographically matched nondonors, the risk of death or major cardiovascular events over a median seven years follow-up (maximum 18 years) was lower in donors than in healthy nondonors (2.8 versus 4.1 events per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.90) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The risk of death-censored major cardiovascular events was similar among donors and nondonors (1.7 versus 2.0 events per 1000 person-years; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57-1.27).
        </p>
        <p>
         One study with longer follow-up (a median follow-up of 15 years, maximum 25 years) compared cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in 1901 kidney donors with a control group of 32,621 healthy, matched controls selected from a population-based survey carried out in Norway between 1984 and 1987 (Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [HUNT] I) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Mortality curves were similar for donors and nondonors over the first 15 years but subsequently diverged. At 25 years after donation, the cumulative all-cause mortality was approximately 18 percent among donors and 13 percent among healthy nondonors (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.5). However, the absolute mortality during the observation period was low in both groups: 224 deaths among 1901 donors and 2425 deaths among 32,621 controls (or 0.12 versus 0.074 percent, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited data are available on the effects of donation on cardiovascular pathophysiology. The Chronic Renal Impairment in Birmingham (CRIB)-Donor study prospectively examined changes in left ventricular (LV) mass and other cardiovascular disease surrogate markers among 124 donors at two United Kingdom centers (2011 to 2014) at 12 months postdonation [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with healthy nondonors, donors had larger increases in LV mass (-3±8 versus +7±10 g, respectively) and LV mass/volume ratio (-0.01±0.09 versus +0.06±0.12 g/mL) but decreased aortic distensibility. Donors were also more likely than controls to develop detectable highly sensitive troponin T levels and microalbuminuria. The increase in LV mass among donors was independently associated with the magnitude of decrease in measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These observations warrant replication efforts in larger cohorts with longer follow-up to better define the impacts of donation on cardiovascular disease surrogates and clinical events.

         When compared with well-matched, equally healthy controls, donor nephrectomy appears to increase the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), although the absolute risk is low [

         <a href="#rid6">
          6

        <p>
         Although 50 percent of the functioning kidney mass is removed during donor nephrectomy, compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining normal kidney returns the GFR to approximately 70 percent of baseline at 10 to 14 days [
         <a href="#rid21">

         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. The trajectory of change in GFR beyond 36 months postdonation requires characterization in larger, demographically diverse samples. In the general population, GFR declines with age, although the rate of decline appears widely variable across individuals [

         In one study, 1901 kidney donors were compared with 32,621 healthy, demographically matched controls from a population-based survey carried out in Norway between 1984 and 1987 (HUNT I) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Compared with controls, the risk of ESKD was higher among donors (with HR adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and body mass index [BMI] of 11.4, 95% CI 4.4-29.6). Among 1901 donors, 9 (0.47 percent) developed ESKD compared with 22 of 32,621 (0.07 percent) control individuals. The crude incidence of ESKD after donation was 302 per million person-years, whereas the estimated incidence of ESKD in the general population in Norway is 100 per million person-years. The median time to ESKD among donors was 18.7 years.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         ESKD among the Norwegian donors was mostly due to immunologic diseases including glomerulonephritis (three), systemic lupus erythematosus (one), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (two), sarcoidosis (one), and diabetes/nephrosclerosis (two). Thus, it is possible that the increase in risk of ESKD was related to genetically determined immunologic factors rather than the nephrectomy itself [

Among 20,024 NHANES participants, 9364 had no identified contraindications to kidney donation (based upon patient self-report, physical examination, and radiologic and laboratory evaluation at NHANES enrollment) and were demographically matched 1:1 to donors with replacement, such that individual NHANES participants served as controls for multiple kidney donors. Sixty-eight percent of donors were biologically related to recipients.

         ESKD developed in 99 donors a mean of 8.6 years after donation. ESKD developed in 36 matched nondonors (drawn from 17 events among the unmatched nondonor cohort). Among donors who developed ESKD, 83 were biologically related to the recipient.

Estimated lifetime ESKD risk based on splicing observations for donors observed at different ages was 90 per 10,000 among donors compared with 14 per 10,000 among healthy nondonors.

In addition, donors may have had a lower competing risk of death for a given comparable decline in kidney function. Finally, whereas donors were identified as having ESKD by virtue of a requirement for dialysis, by transplantation, or by activation to the deceased-donor transplant list, ESKD in controls was identified by requirement for dialysis or elective transplantation. Since the kidney allocation policy prioritizes living donors who develop ESKD and since donors are generally closely scrutinized for decline in kidney function, it is possible that donors were transplanted earlier (ie, at a higher estimated GFR [eGFR]) compared with controls.

For a 40-year-old person with health characteristics similar to those of age-matched donors, 15-year projected ESKD risk in the absence of donation varied according to race and sex: 0.24 percent among Black males, 0.15 percent among Black females, 0.06 percent among White males, and 0.04 percent among White females. Estimated ESKD risk was higher in the presence of a lower eGFR, higher albuminuria, hypertension, current or former smoking, diabetes, and obesity. Projected lifetime ESKD was highest among young adults, especially among young African Americans. The observed incidence of ESKD at 15 years among United States kidney donors was 3.5 to 5.3 times the projected risks for healthy persons in the absence of donation by sex and race.

         The impact of some ESKD risk factors may differ in donors compared with nondonors. A retrospective study of 119,769 United States donors found a stronger impact of obesity than reported in the healthy person projection tool, such that each unit increase in BMI among overweight and obese donors increased the risk of ESKD by 7 percent [

The absolute risk difference over the follow-up time was modest, at 1.4 percent, and the number needed to harm was 71. At 20 years, the cumulative incidence of gout was 2 percent higher in donors compared with nondonors (6.8 versus 4.9 percent).

         The risk of gout after kidney donation may vary based on race. A study of 4650 kidney donors from the United States, including 13.1 percent African Americans, found that, by seven years, African Americans were almost twice as likely to develop gout as White donors (4.4 versus 2.4 percent; aHR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.2) [

          55

         ]. Postdonation gout risk also increased with older age at donation (aHR per year 1.05) and was higher in males (aHR 2.80). Compared with matched donors without gout, donors with gout had more frequent diagnoses for kidney conditions including acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other disorders of the kidney. Future studies should examine whether the direct impacts of donation on the risk and consequences of gout differ according to demographic traits.

         African American individuals are generally at higher risk than White individuals for the development of hypertension and CKD in the general population, and this increased risk has been observed among kidney donors [

At a mean follow-up of approximately 6.6 years, the frequency of hypertension was higher among kidney donors compared with nondonors (41 versus 18 percent, respectively; RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4).

         Linkage of OPTN living-donor registry with administrative billing claims from a private health insurer found that, as compared with White donors, African American donors had increased risk of postdonation diagnoses of hypertension (aHR 1.52, 95% CI 1.23-1.88), diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy (aHR 2.31, 95% CI 1.33-3.98), and CKD (aHR 2.32, 95% CI 1.48-3.62) [

         Outcomes are generally acceptable among carefully selected older living donors. In a study of 3368 older donors (≥55 years) in the United States (1996 to 2006), all-cause mortality over a median eight years follow-up did not differ significantly from that of healthy, demographically matched nondonors selected from the Health and Retirement Study (4.9 versus 5.6 deaths per 1000 person-years, HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71-1.15) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         ]. There was also no difference in a composite outcome of death or cardiovascular disease (defined as ischemic cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87-1.20).
        </p>
        <p>
         A review of 219 living kidney donors over the age of 70 years demonstrated donor survival of 99.5, 95.8, and 90 percent at 1, 5, and 10 years [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81

However, the graft survival in the recipients was only comparable with deceased donors aged 50 to 59 years and significantly lower compared with allografts from living donors aged 50 to 59 years.
        </p>

         In addition, patients &gt;60 years are more likely to have a GFR &lt;60 mL/min after donation [

          63,82

         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. At a median follow-up of 5.5 years, significantly more older donors had an eGFR &lt;60 mL/min compared with younger donors (80 versus 31 percent). However, there was no difference between groups in the mean maximal decline in GFR (38±9 percent), which, in both groups, remained stable out to 13 years; however, the starting GFR was lower among older patients (80 versus 96 mL/min/1.73 m

        <p>
         In a United States registry-based study, cumulative incidence of ESKD at 15 years per 10,000 individuals was 29 for donors 18 to 39 years, 17 for those 40 to 49 years, 55 for those 50 to 59 years, and 70 for those over 60 years of age [

         With regard to measures of pain beyond the perioperative period, a study of pharmacy claims data among a sample of privately insured United States donors found that, while prescription narcotic use was more common among females than males in the intermediate term after donation, total narcotic exposure was lower than among nondonors from the general population [

         Some donors have experienced psychosocial difficulties (eg, depression, anxiety, stress, worries about health) that may impact their function and capability to return to work. Among respondents in the RELIVE study, 9 percent reported one or more of the following poor psychosocial outcomes: "fair" or "poor" overall donor experience, financial burden, regret or discomfort with decision to donate, or psychological difficulties since donation [

Recipient graft failure was the only identified predictor of reporting one or more of these poor psychosocial outcomes and was associated with 77 percent higher risk (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.33-2.34). In a study of 4650 United States donors, postdonation depression rates did not exceed that of general population nondonors [

         Donor candidates and actual donors incur personal direct and indirect expenses as part of the evaluation and donation procedure, even in countries where the donor's medical expenses are paid by the recipient's insurance or the health care system.

Few living kidney donors reported receiving financial support from the transplant candidate (6 percent), transplant candidate's family (3 percent), a nonprofit organization (3 percent), the National Living Donor Assistance Center (7 percent), or transplant center (3 percent). Higher total costs were significantly associated with longer distance traveled to the transplant center.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, some states have enacted legislation to offer tax deductions or credits, or other benefits, to living organ donors [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93,94
         </a>
         ]. These programs vary state by state, are underused, and have not been studied with regard to impacts on financial burdens of donation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Coordinating the timing of the donor candidate evaluation with work and dependent care schedules may minimize indirect costs. An earlier return to work may be facilitated by the use of laparoscopic compared with open donor nephrectomy [
         <a href="#rid95">
          95
         </a>
         ]. By 2013, almost all living donations in the United States are performed laparoscopically, and, with increasing experience with the laparoscopic procedure, few are converted to open procedures [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Living organ donors may encounter difficulties with insurance after donation. This was shown in a systematic review of 23 studies including 2076 living organ donors, 385 potential donors, and 239 responses from insurance companies [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97
         </a>
         ]. Three to 11 percent of donors stated that they had problems obtaining insurance. In a more recent study that included 395 individuals in the United States who either changed or initiated health insurance after kidney donation, 27 (7 percent) reported difficulty; of these, 15 were denied health insurance, and 12 were charged a higher premium [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98
         </a>
         ]. Eight individuals were told they had a preexisting condition because of kidney donation. Among 186 individuals who changed or initiated life insurance after kidney donation, 46 (25 percent) had difficulty obtaining life insurance; of these, 23 were denied insurance, and 27 were charged a higher premium. Seventeen were told they had a preexisting condition because of kidney donation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The economic impacts of donation may extend beyond direct costs to longer-term impacts on employment and socioeconomic status, although data on these outcomes are limited. A retrospective analysis of 1285 living kidney donors who donated at seven university-affiliated hospitals in South Korea found that donors had a higher likelihood of employment loss in years 1 to 2 after enrollment compared with healthy non-donor controls (22 versus 11 percent; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.27) [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99
         </a>
         ]. Living donors also had an increased likelihood of worsened household economic quartiles (22 versus 16 percent; aOR 1.54) and parallel decreases in likelihood of economic improvement (31 versus 43 percent; aOR 0.57) in years 1 to 2. While more work is needed to understand the mechanisms of these findings, there is a clear call for robust efforts to prioritize financial health along with medical health in protecting the safety of living donation [
         <a href="#rid100">
          100
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Living-donor candidates should receive counseling about financial costs prior to donation, education on how to access available financial supports, and the limitations of available resources. Recommendations to advance financial neutrality for donors and donor candidates include allocation of resources for standardized system of reimbursement of donation-related costs, improved tax credits, and legislation to standardize employment and insurability protections [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101,102
         </a>
         ]. The American Society of Transplantation Live Donor Community of practice developed a toolkit to help living-donor candidates and donors prepare for financial impacts of donation and links to resources including state tax credits and assistance-ships that may be available for cost mitigation [

          Overview
         </strong>
         – The complications from kidney donation can be divided into perioperative risks and risks that may arise many years after donation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Perioperative risks
         </strong>
         – Perioperative mortality after living-donor nephrectomy is 1 in 3000 at 90 days. In addition to death, the most important perioperative risks of donor nephrectomy include hemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound complications, and deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Perioperative risks'

         <strong>
          Long-term risks
         </strong>
         – Living donation may cause small increases in the long-term risks of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), preeclampsia, hypertension, and metabolic diseases such as gout. These risks should be discussed with all donor candidates. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Long-term risks'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          ESKD
         </strong>
         – The risk of ESKD among donors is low but appears to be higher than among healthy nondonors. Estimation of projected risk of ESKD in the absence of donation according to a donor candidate's predonation demographic and health characteristics may improve consistency and transparency in the evaluation and selection of donor candidates. The overall incidence and donation-related risks of ESKD and hypertension after kidney donation are higher among African American compared with White donors. (See
         <a class="local">
          'End-stage kidney disease'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Maternal and fetal outcomes
         </strong>
         – We generally advise females that it is ideal to have completed planned childbearing prior to kidney donation. Living kidney donation appears to increase the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia compared with experience among otherwise similar healthy females. Nevertheless, given the generally good pregnancy outcomes after donation, females should not be excluded based on plans for possible future childbearing alone, and females may value the available information differently in their donation decision. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Maternal and fetal outcomes'

         <strong>
          Psychosocial outcomes
         </strong>
         – Donor candidates can be informed that, in general, donors demonstrate good quality of life and have a low rate of donation-related regret. However, some do experience psychosocial difficulties after donation (eg, depression, anxiety, a negative change in their relationships, or more pain or slower recovery than expected). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Psychosocial outcomes'

         <strong>
          Economic considerations
         </strong>
         – Donor candidates and actual donors incur personal direct and indirect expenses as part of the evaluation and donation procedure, even in countries where the donor's medical expenses are paid by the recipient's insurance or the health care system. Major costs include transportation, accommodation, childcare, and lost income (or vacation time) from missed work. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Economic considerations'
