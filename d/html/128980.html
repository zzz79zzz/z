         Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          APC
         </em>
         are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant disorder. Individuals with FAP are at increased risk for developing gastrointestinal polyps and several cancers. The location of the variant within the
         <em>
          APC
         </em>
         gene can influence the severity of colonic polyposis, degree of cancer risk, age of cancer onset, and likelihood of extracolonic manifestations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Variants associated with attenuated FAP (AFAP) are typically located at the far 5' or 3' ends of the
         <em>
          APC
         </em>
         gene.

         A commonly reported
         <em>
          APC
         </em>
         variant, p.Ile1307Lys (p.I1307K; c.3920T&gt;A), is found in approximately 8 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. This variant, often reported as a moderate or increased risk allele by laboratories, is not associated with colonic polyposis or FAP, but it increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 1.5- to twofold. Risks for other cancer types have not been established.

         Classic FAP is characterized by the presence of multiple colorectal adenomas. In classic FAP, there are &gt;100 adenomatous colorectal polyps. Polyposis typically develops in the second or third decade of life. Colorectal cancer occurs in essentially all untreated individuals.

         We consider all individuals with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in
         <em>
          APC
         </em>
         to be at risk for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), regardless of the initial reason for testing. Exceptions are noted above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Disease associations'
         </a>
         above). Information on the
         <em>
          APC
         </em>
         variant (eg, location within the gene) and personal and family history may help determine if the individual should be managed as having classic or attenuated FAP (AFAP).
        </p>
        <p>
         Discussion should include the range of cancer risks, possible interventions for surveillance or risk reduction, and implications for family members. (See
         <a class="local">
          'At-risk relatives'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Counseling may require additional visits or referrals. Acting upon genetic test results is rarely an emergency; the individual can be reassured that management decisions can be deferred until questions are answered.
        </p>
        <p>
         We adhere to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations for surveillance and risk reduction [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Findings in family members (type of cancers, age of onset) may also inform surveillance (starting at an earlier age if a family member has an earlier age of onset).
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to annual physical examination, several evaluations and interventions are recommended to reduce the risk of FAP-associated cancers  (

         Individuals with FAP should have screening for gastric and duodenal polyps, with upper endoscopy and duodenoscopy. This is initiated at the onset of colonic polyposis or age 20 to 25 years, whichever comes first. Screening should be performed earlier if there is a history of early onset gastroduodenal cancer in the family.
