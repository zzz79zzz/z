In addition, adjunctive psychotherapy is generally regarded as essential [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Fewer studies have been conducted in pediatric bipolar patients than adult patients; thus, treatment is often based upon adult studies [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. However, response to specific medications may differ between youth and adults.</p><p>Although pharmacotherapy is indicated for nearly all youth with bipolar disorder, approximately one-third of patients do not receive medications [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. As an example, an eight-year prospective observational study enrolled youth with mania who were treated in the community (n = 115), and found that antimanic medications (antipsychotics, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, or anticonvulsants) were never prescribed to 37 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>In addition, the wrong medication regimen is frequently administered to children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. A retrospective study found that among bipolar patients who were treated for mania with or without mixed features (n = 282), antidepressant monotherapy was prescribed for 24 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the choice of treatment for pediatric bipolar disorder. Other aspects of pediatric bipolar disorder are discussed separately, including the general principles of using pharmacotherapy; efficacy, administration, and side effects of second-generation antipsychotics for mania; efficacy and core elements of adjunctive psychotherapy; assessment and diagnosis; and the epidemiology, clinical features, and course of illness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98716.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98719.html" rel="external">"Pediatric mania and second-generation antipsychotics: Efficacy, administration, and side effects"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98754.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Efficacy and core elements of adjunctive psychotherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83083.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15924.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H667756632"><span class="h1">SETTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The appropriate level of care (setting) for treating youth with bipolar disorder varies. During periods of significant impairment or elevated risk of suicidal or dangerous behavior, inpatient, intermediate levels of care (eg, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient programs, or in-home services), or frequent outpatient visits and phone/electronic contact may be required. When indicated, higher levels of care can provide a safer treatment environment, closer monitoring of symptoms and side effects, more frequent adjustments of pharmacotherapy, and/or more intensive psychotherapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H109663768"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A separate topic discusses the general principles for treating pediatric bipolar disorder with pharmacotherapy, including the role of the pediatrician; assessing patients prior to treatment; prescribing medications to age appropriate patients; indications for pharmacotherapy (and electroconvulsive therapy); using monotherapy, medication combinations, and drugs that may destabilize patients; administering medications as part of comprehensive treatment; monitoring patient progress; the duration of an adequate drug trial; and information for patients and families. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98716.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10835625"><span class="h1">MANIA</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1490741054"><span class="h2">Approach to treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest that acute treatment of pediatric mania proceed according to the sequence described in the subsections below. Patients receive initial pharmacotherapy and progress through each step until they respond. The duration of an adequate treatment trial is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98716.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles", section on 'Duration of an adequate trial'</a>.)</p><p>The primary treatments that are suggested for pediatric mania, either as monotherapy or combination therapy, include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Second-generation antipsychotics</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">Lithium</a></p><p></p><p>In addition, psychotherapy is nearly always indicated as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar disorder. (See <a class="local">'Adjunctive psychotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Following response to acute treatment, patients receive maintenance treatment to prevent recurrences. (See <a class="local">'Maintenance pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10835632"><span class="h3">Initial drugs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial pharmacotherapy for pediatric mania is a second-generation antipsychotic, such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13180" href="/z/d/drug information/13180.html" rel="external">aripiprazole</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="117924" href="/z/d/drug information/117924.html" rel="external">asenapine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16033" href="/z/d/drug information/16033.html" rel="external">olanzapine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="89427" href="/z/d/drug information/89427.html" rel="external">quetiapine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12770" href="/z/d/drug information/12770.html" rel="external">risperidone</a>, or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="15622" href="/z/d/drug information/15622.html" rel="external">ziprasidone</a>. The efficacy and tolerability of these drugs has been established in many studies, including 10 randomized trials [<a href="#rid7">7-16</a>]. As an example, an eight-week open-label trial in youth with mania or mixed mania (n = 279) found that improvement was greater with risperidone, compared with either <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a> or divalproex [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Based upon randomized trials, clinicians can expect that remission with second-generation antipsychotics will occur in approximately 25 to 70 percent of patients, and response (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms ≥50 percent) in 50 to 90 percent [<a href="#rid7">7-16</a>]. The use of second-generation antipsychotics for mania is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1,17-19</a>] as well as common clinical practice [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>No head-to-head randomized trials have compared different second-generation antipsychotics in children and adolescents with mania; across separate trials, the clinical effect of these drugs appears to be comparable [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The specific choice thus depends on factors such as past response to medications, side effect profiles, comorbidities, potential drug-drug interactions, patient preference, and cost. As an example [<a href="#rid19">19,22</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extrapyramidal symptoms may occur less often with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="89427" href="/z/d/drug information/89427.html" rel="external">quetiapine</a> or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16033" href="/z/d/drug information/16033.html" rel="external">olanzapine</a> than other atypical antipsychotics, such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12770" href="/z/d/drug information/12770.html" rel="external">risperidone</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperprolactinemia may occur more often with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12770" href="/z/d/drug information/12770.html" rel="external">risperidone</a> than other second-generation antipsychotics.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and hyperlipidemia, appear to be more pronounced with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16033" href="/z/d/drug information/16033.html" rel="external">olanzapine</a> than other atypical antipsychotics, and least likely to occur in <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="15622" href="/z/d/drug information/15622.html" rel="external">ziprasidone</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with risk factors for or a history of cardiac disease generally do not receive <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="15622" href="/z/d/drug information/15622.html" rel="external">ziprasidone</a> because the drug may prolong the QTc interval.</p><p></p><p>The efficacy, administration, monitoring, and side effects of second-generation antipsychotics in pediatric mania are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98719.html" rel="external">"Pediatric mania and second-generation antipsychotics: Efficacy, administration, and side effects"</a>.)</p><p>For pediatric patients with mania who do not respond to treatment with one antipsychotic within four to eight weeks of starting treatment, or do not tolerate the drug, we suggest tapering and discontinuing the failed medication over one to two weeks, and simultaneously starting and titrating up another second-generation antipsychotic. (Response is defined as substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms.) The failed medication is generally tapered by the same amount for each dose decrease. As an example, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="89427" href="/z/d/drug information/89427.html" rel="external">quetiapine</a> 300 mg per day is decreased by 50 mg per day, every one to three days. We generally attempt two or three trials of antipsychotics before proceeding to next-step treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10835639"><span class="h3">Treatment-resistant patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pediatric mania often does not respond to multiple (eg, two to three) trials of second-generation antipsychotics. For these treatment-resistant patients, we suggest <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>. For patients who responded partially to initial treatment with an antipsychotic, we add lithium to the antipsychotic. For patients who demonstrate little or no response to antipsychotics, we taper and discontinue the antipsychotic over one to two weeks, and at the same time start lithium and titrate the dose up.</p><p>Prior to starting <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, clinicians should obtain laboratory tests that include blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone), and an electrocardiogram [<a href="#rid1">1,22</a>]. These tests establish a baseline for monitoring lithium’s long-term effects upon the kidneys, thyroid gland, and heart, and ruling out contraindications to using lithium. These long-term side effects and contraindications are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15317.html" rel="external">"Bipolar disorder in adults and lithium: Pharmacology, administration, and management of adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p>Females of childbearing potential should be informed of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>’s teratogenic effects, and a urine pregnancy test should be obtained prior to initiating lithium and whenever there is a possibility that a patient is pregnant [<a href="#rid1">1,23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17159.html" rel="external">"Teratogenicity, pregnancy complications, and postnatal risks of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, and electroconvulsive therapy", section on 'Lithium'</a>.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">Lithium</a> is often started in children and adolescents at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day, in two or three divided doses [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. However, a reasonable alternative is to initiate treatment at 15 to 25 mg/kg/day in patients who are concerned about side effects. Another alternative in youth weighing &lt;30 kg is to initiate lithium at a dose of 300 mg twice daily, and in youth weighing ≥30 kg to start treatment at a dose of 300 mg three times per day [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">Lithium</a> serum concentrations are measured after the first week of treatment, and doses are titrated up by 300 mg/day every four to seven days, depending upon response and tolerability, as well as serum levels. The target serum concentration is 0.6 to 1.4 mEq/L (0.6 to 1.4 mmol/L) [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Serum levels at the higher end of the target range appear to provide better symptom control, but also cause more adverse effects. Doses of immediate release preparations ≥900 mg/day are administered in three divided doses, and doses &lt;900 mg/day in two divided doses; clinicians should attempt to avoid prescribing more than 900 mg at any one time because the tolerability of high single doses is frequently poor. Extended-release preparations are usually given twice per day, but can be administered once daily.</p><p><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">Lithium</a> serum concentrations are measured four to seven days after each dose change [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Lithium levels are drawn approximately 12 hours after the last dose (12-hour serum trough level), and generally collected in the morning before the first dose of the day. However, levels drawn 11 to 13 hours after the last dose, or even 10 to 14 hours, provide meaningful information. By contrast, serum levels drawn a few hours after lithium ingestion provide less meaningful information.</p><p>After a stable <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a> dose is achieved, we repeat the blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, thyrotropin, and electrocardiogram [<a href="#rid1">1,22,23</a>]. Subsequently, lithium serum concentrations, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and thyrotropin are measured every three to six months.</p><p>The most common side effects of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a> in children and adolescents are gastrointestinal (such as pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) [<a href="#rid22">22,23,27</a>]. Other side effects can include an acne-like rash, tremor, sedation, slowed mentation, hypothyroidism, weight gain, polyuria, polydipsia, and possible structural renal changes from long-term use. As an example, a randomized trial found that between baseline and week 8, the prevalence of abdominal pain in patients treated with lithium (n = 84) increased from 6 to 41 percent of patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In addition, excessive thirst increased from 4 to 44 percent of patients, mean serum concentration of thyrotropin more than doubled (from 2 to 5 mU/L), and patients gained an average of 1.4 kg. (However, another eight-week trial found that weight gain with lithium and placebo was comparable [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].) It may be possible to ameliorate adverse gastrointestinal effects by administering the drug with food, dividing the dose more frequently (eg, four doses per day), or using extended-release or liquid citrate formulations [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Hypothyroidism is managed by adding <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12550" href="/z/d/drug information/12550.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> or switching from lithium to a different drug. Additional information about adverse effects is discussed separately in the context of adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15317.html" rel="external">"Bipolar disorder in adults and lithium: Pharmacology, administration, and management of adverse effects", section on 'Managing lithium adverse effects'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2358.html" rel="external">"Renal toxicity of lithium"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7843.html" rel="external">"Lithium and the thyroid"</a>.)</p><p>The serum concentration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a> is regularly monitored because lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, which means that the dose at which it is clinically effective is only slightly lower than the dose at which it becomes toxic. The symptoms and management of lithium toxicity are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15317.html" rel="external">"Bipolar disorder in adults and lithium: Pharmacology, administration, and management of adverse effects", section on 'Lithium toxicity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/320.html" rel="external">"Lithium poisoning"</a>.)</p><p>In addition, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a> levels must be closely monitored in patients taking medications that change renal function, salt balance, or water balance; these medications can alter lithium excretion and serum lithium concentrations. Drug interactions with lithium are discussed separately.

However, weight gain was greater with aripiprazole than placebo (2.6 versus 0.4 kg), as was the incidence of stomach pain and musculoskeletal pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study initially recruited patients with an active mood episode despite treatment with pharmacotherapy, such as second-generation antipsychotics, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, divalproex, and/or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13113" href="/z/d/drug information/13113.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a>; patients with comorbid ADHD were also receiving stimulants [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].

Patients were followed for up to 36 weeks. After controlling for patient age and sex, type of index mood episode, and use of antipsychotics and stimulants, time to recurrence of a mood episode was longer with adjunctive lamotrigine than placebo (hazard ratio 0.63).</p><p></p><p>There is no indication from head-to-head trials that any drug is superior for maintenance treatment. As an example, a 76-week randomized trial compared <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a> monotherapy with divalproex monotherapy in children and adolescents who initially responded to acute phase treatment with the combination of lithium plus divalproex (n = 60) [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. The median time to recurrence with lithium monotherapy and divalproex monotherapy was comparable (approximately 16 weeks).</p><p>We suggest that patients with psychotic features who respond to combination treatment, such as a second-generation antipsychotic plus <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12559" href="/z/d/drug information/12559.html" rel="external">lithium</a>, continue both drugs for at least two to six months [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]; combination treatment longer than six months is suggested for patients who were severely ill (eg, attempted suicide) during the index episode or patients whose prior history indicates the need for maintenance treatment with multiple medications. Patients who remain stable on combination treatment can eventually attempt to gradually taper and discontinue lithium (see <a class="local">'Discontinuation'</a> below). Patients should subsequently maintain treatment with the second-generation antipsychotic.</p><p>Pediatric bipolar major depression may respond to an acute regimen that includes an antidepressant. The use of antidepressants in maintenance treatment is discussed separately.

This approach is consistent with practice guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1,50</a>].</p><p>Although the duration of maintenance treatment varies among patients, some patients require maintenance treatment for many years, and some patients require it their entire lives [<a href="#rid1">1,50</a>]. Factors to consider include prior response to medication discontinuation, how many years the patient has had bipolar disorder, and the lifetime number and severity of mood episodes. Maintenance treatment should last longer for patients with a more severe course of illness. Although intolerable side effects may truncate maintenance treatment altogether, clinicians should first try to find better tolerated alternatives.</p><p>Some patients are discouraged by the prospect of taking their medication "forever." In such cases, it is important to emphasize the long-term nature of the relationship between the clinician and patient, and that the need for maintenance treatment will periodically be reevaluated in light of the patient's progress in maintaining symptomatic and functional stability. It may also help to point out that other chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus and asthma often require life-time medications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H264945895"><span class="h2">Discontinuation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with pediatric bipolar disorder may want to stop maintenance medications because of side effects, inadequate benefits, general medical illnesses, pregnancy, or a wish to be medication-free after a prolonged period of euthymia. However, studies of adult patients suggest that discontinuing stable treatment usually leads to a new mood episode. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/680.html" rel="external">"Bipolar disorder in adults: Choosing maintenance treatment", section on 'Discontinuation'</a>.)</p><p>Other risks of stopping maintenance treatment include hospitalization, persistent subsyndromal symptoms, family and economic losses, and suicide. Psychoeducation may help discourage patients from discontinuing effective maintenance treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98754.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Efficacy and core elements of adjunctive psychotherapy", section on 'Psychoeducation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96007.html" rel="external">"Bipolar disorder in adults: Managing poor adherence to maintenance pharmacotherapy", section on 'Consequences'</a>.)</p><p>If patients insist on stopping treatment, we suggest slowly tapering the medication; based upon clinical experience, the drug is tapered over a period of several months (at least four to six months) unless negative effects dictate a more rapid taper. For patients who are taking multiple medications, we slowly taper and discontinue one drug at a time [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The first drug to be removed is generally the adjuvant; if both drugs are considered essential, the first drug to be stopped is the one most likely to cause side effects with long-term use.</p><p>During the process of tapering and discontinuing pharmacotherapy, clinicians should monitor patients regularly (eg, every two to four weeks) for prodromal symptoms of recurrence [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Prospective observational studies in adults show that tapering maintenance medication more slowly is associated with lower rates of recurrence, but that most patients suffer a recurrence despite the slower taper. Patients and families should be educated about the symptoms of relapse and counseled to quickly seek clinical attention if they occur.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5072309"><span class="h1">ADJUNCTIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychotherapy is nearly always indicated as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar disorder, and prescribing psychotherapy is consistent with practice guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1,17,18</a>].
