Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, is one of the most common complaints by patients and is characterized by general breathing discomfort that has different meanings to different people. The American Thoracic Society and other expert groups recognize dyspnea as a very complex phenomenon that arises from multiple physiologic, psychologic, social, and environmental factors [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of dyspnea can be complex and generally requires a history (eg, smoking, pattern and triggers of symptoms), complete physical examination, laboratory testing, electrocardiogram, and pulmonary function tests [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. While the five most common causes of dyspnea are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), heart disease, and obesity/deconditioning [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], the wide variety of possibilities makes it challenging to develop a diagnostic strategy that is both time and cost effective, as well as complete [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. A CPET can often be helpful in narrowing down the diagnostic possibilities.</p><p>The use of CPET in the evaluation of dyspnea will be reviewed here. Other topics, such as an approach to the evaluation of dyspnea, the physiology of exercise, the role of exercise testing in children and adolescents, and exercise testing in the management of heart failure, are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1436.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with dyspnea"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1433.html" rel="external">"Exercise physiology"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6473.html" rel="external">"Exercise testing in children and adolescents: Principles and clinical application"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3465.html" rel="external">"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2299560884"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p>V<sub>E</sub> – Minute ventilation, volume of air exhaled (L/minute)</p><p>V<sub>EMAX</sub> – Maximum minute ventilation at peak exercise (L/minute)</p><p>VO<sub>2</sub> – Measurement of oxygen uptake (L/minute)</p><p>VCO<sub>2</sub> – Measurement of carbon dioxide output from the lungs (L/minute)</p><p>VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> – Respiratory exchange ratio (RER;

Such an evaluation should include review of medications (eg, beta-blockers that may affect heart rate response or inhaled beta-agonists that may affect ventilatory response) and a directed physical exam (eg, baseline cardiac and lung exam) so that any changes with exercise may be detected. Baseline spirometry should be obtained to detect any underlying obstruction or possible restrictive disease and to establish the maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) for later calculation of breathing reserve. Most CPET software programs use forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) x 35 or 40 as an estimate of MVV, although it can also be measured directly in motivated patients.</p><p>Most patients with unexplained dyspnea should have had prior work-up for cardiopulmonary disease and anemia, including resting echocardiography, a cardiac stress test, complete pulmonary function testing (spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity), exercise oximetry, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, and a complete blood count. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1436.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with dyspnea"</a>.)</p><p>Pretest evaluation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through antigen or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is appropriate as the high minute ventilation of CPET is thought to increase the risk of aerosol generation and COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2) transmission by infected, but asymptomatic patients [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1463848131"><span class="h2">Exercise testing equipment and protocols</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CPETs are typically performed in a specialized testing unit with capability for continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring (ie, electrocardiogram, automated blood pressure monitoring, continuous pulse oximetry); a metabolic unit to measure respiratory rate, tidal volume, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and work output; and personnel to monitor the test, obtain arterial blood gases, and respond to emergencies.</p><p>For infection control purposes, CPET equipment should be fitted with single-use mouthpieces and disposable in-line bacterial and viral filters [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. It is preferred that negative pressure rooms with at least six air exchanges per hour be used for testing.</p><p>The cycle ergometer and treadmill are the most common modalities of testing. Different protocols are available to allow the individual to reach their maximal power output within about 8 to 15 minutes with a symptom-limited end to the test. The protocols typically include incremental increases in the power output over predefined time intervals, such as an increase of 25 watts every three minutes (staged) or an increase of 5 to 25 watts every one minute (incremental), and may occur in a stepped or ramp-up format. Increments are often tailored to expected patient fitness; greater increments than those described may be used for testing in extremely fit individuals. Protocols for evaluating patients with heart failure are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3465.html" rel="external">"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in cardiovascular disease", section on 'Exercise test protocols'</a>.)</p><p>Testing includes measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), ventilation, and concentrations of expired gases (oxygen [O<sub>2</sub>] and carbon dioxide [CO<sub>2</sub>]) both at rest (prior to starting exercise) and continuously throughout exercise. These parameters are typically reported at brief intervals (eg, every 30 seconds or sliding average over every seven breaths) during exercise. Borg ratings of dyspnea and/or fatigue  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981" href="/z/d/graphic/63981.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) are usually obtained at baseline, and the patient is asked to rate their peak level of dyspnea and/or fatigue at the conclusion of the test. Patients are also asked to identify the primary reason they had to stop exercising (eg, shortness of breath, leg discomfort). Flow-volume loops may be performed during and after the test, which may be informative in patients where airflow obstruction is suspected of limiting exercise ability.</p><p>Arterial blood gases may be obtained at rest and at peak exercise to assess the effect of exercise on the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-a O<sub>2</sub> difference) and document the development of metabolic acidosis after reaching the anaerobic threshold. In some laboratories, periodic arterial blood gases are obtained at short intervals of one to two minutes via an indwelling arterial line, although resting and peak values obtained by individual arterial sticks are typically sufficient.</p><p>Monitoring of all variables is typically continued one to five minutes into the recovery period, depending on local practice.</p><p>The data collected during the test are typically available to the interpreting clinician or physiologist in tables that display the data over time of the test (eg, every 30 seconds) and graphical displays that highlight cardiovascular and respiratory response patterns. A 9-panel plot is commonly used in final CPET reports  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123013" href="/z/d/graphic/123013.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The technique for continuous laryngoscopy during exercise for the evaluation of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119345.html" rel="external">"Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction", section on 'Continuous laryngoscopy during exercise'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1764263018"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE TESTING (CPET)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2703268088"><span class="h2">General features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CPET is a comprehensive exercise test that is designed to allow assessment of the physiologic factors that limit maximal exercise capacity [<a href="#rid4">4,5,10-17</a>]. These factors may be related to the cardiovascular system, ventilatory and gas exchange response, or metabolic issues. The ability to exercise and reach a normal maximal exercise capacity is related to the normal functioning of each of these systems as an integrated whole. A full description of normal exercise physiology is provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1433.html" rel="external">"Exercise physiology"</a>.)</p><p>CPET allows the measurement and identification of the patterns of the body’s responses to exercise. Since most dyspnea is associated with exertion, CPET provides the opportunity to simulate real-world conditions to cause dyspnea on exertion under controlled and monitored circumstances. The development of dyspnea can then be related to the normal or abnormal functioning of each of the body systems that contribute to maximal exercise capacity. Other clinical uses of CPET, such as the evaluation of pulmonary disability, preoperative assessment for lung resection, and monitoring exercise capacity in heart failure, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6966.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of pulmonary disability"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6973.html" rel="external">"Preoperative physiologic pulmonary evaluation for lung resection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3503.html" rel="external">"Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure"</a>.)</p><p>Most metabolic carts generate a 9-panel display  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123013" href="/z/d/graphic/123013.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). While the measurements are interrelated, the top row (panels 1 to 3) typically relates to metabolic and cardiovascular responses, the middle row (panels 4 to 6) to ventilatory and gas exchange responses, and the bottom row (panels 7 to 9) to mechanical responses. Individual measurements are discussed in more detail below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1689945123"><span class="h2">Metabolic measurements</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H556600649"><span class="h3">Maximum oxygen uptake</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) provides assessment of exercise capacity and differentiates normal from abnormal exercise tolerance. However, a true maximum VO<sub>2</sub> is often not reached, so the highest peak VO<sub>2</sub> is taken as the measure of exercise capacity, assuming a good effort on testing. VO<sub>2</sub> is measured at the mouthpiece, using inhaled and exhaled oxygen concentrations, and reported as L/min or mL/kg/min. Normal is typically considered to be &gt;85 percent predicted. Reference values should represent the exercise protocol and patient population being tested in the exercise laboratory [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>].</p><p>A low peak VO<sub>2</sub> in response to exercise suggests either a problem with O<sub>2</sub> delivery (due to cardiovascular, pulmonary, or circulatory etiologies) or a problem with peripheral utilization, which may be muscular in origin  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57900" href="/z/d/graphic/57900.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). A low peak VO<sub>2</sub> may also reflect poor effort. Of note, it is not uncommon for there to be a discrepancy between the percent predicted peak VO<sub>2</sub> and the percent predicted peak work achieved. It seems reasonable to consider that the maximal metabolic capacity during exercise is assessed by the peak VO<sub>2</sub>, whereas the maximal functional capacity during exercise is assessed by the peak work [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H954982122"><span class="h3">Respiratory exchange ratio</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Overall metabolism can be assessed by the ratio of carbon dioxide output/oxygen uptake (VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>), known as the respiratory exchange ratio (RER). This is the noninvasive measure of the respiratory quotient (RQ) that is occurring at the cellular level. After the change to anaerobic metabolism, more carbon dioxide is produced (from buffering of lactic acid) compared with oxygen consumed. Baseline RER is approximately 0.8, reaches 1.0 at the anaerobic threshold (AT), and exceeds 1.2 during the recovery phase of exercise. A sign of good effort on CPET is an RER &gt;1.16, unless the patient is hyperventilating (most commonly due to anxiety), which can also increase the RER [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4190847297"><span class="h3">Anaerobic threshold</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The AT, also known as the lactate threshold or the ventilatory threshold, represents the point at which lactate accumulation exceeds lactate clearance during exercise. The AT is thought to represent the shift to anaerobic metabolism during exercise. The gold standard for determining AT is measurement of lactic acid or trending of serum bicarbonate during exercise. AT normally occurs at more than 40 percent of maximal predicted VO<sub>2</sub> [<a href="#rid18">18,22</a>].</p><p>The most common noninvasive methods for determining the AT are by determining the VO<sub>2</sub> where the VCO<sub>2</sub> versus VO<sub>2</sub> slope increases (V-slope method), assessing the VO<sub>2</sub> at the nadir of the minute ventilation versus VO<sub>2</sub> relationship (V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>), or evaluating where the plot of end-tidal oxygen tension (P<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) begins to rise  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123008" href="/z/d/graphic/123008.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The accuracy of less invasive approaches is somewhat controversial and can be prone to error that may vary by disease state. There is no one preferred method for determining AT, and we recommend using at least two if not all three methods to help determine the AT with more confidence.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2518416415"><span class="h2">Respiratory measurements</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In normal individuals, exercise is not limited by respiratory factors, so evaluation of respiratory reserve can assess contributions of respiratory disease. Additional measurements of flow and volumes during and after exercise can assist in the diagnosis of respiratory diseases.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Respiratory reserve</strong> – The maximum ventilation at peak exercise (V<sub>Emax</sub>) is normally 60 to 70 percent of maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), leaving a breathing reserve. The respiratory reserve can be described as the difference between the MVV and the V<sub>Emax</sub>, expressed as a percentage ((MVV-V<sub>Emax</sub>)/MVV x 100), such that a normal reserve is 30 to 40 percent. A reduced or absent respiratory reserve (or, equivalently, V<sub>Emax</sub>/MVV approaching 100 percent) suggests that exercise is being limited by ventilatory capacity. This is usually due to respiratory or occasionally neuromuscular disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1433.html" rel="external">"Exercise physiology", section on 'Breathing reserve index'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In performance athletes, there may be a reduced or absent breathing reserve after the maximum VO<sub>2</sub> has been exceeded, signifying a test that has met both the limits of cardiovascular and pulmonary physiologic responses. The patterns of such test results differ in that the maximum VO<sub>2</sub> in performance athletes typically exceeds 100 percent predicted whereas it is reduced in the case of ventilatory limitation to exercise.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Breathing pattern</strong> – Assessment of breathing pattern entails assessment of both the tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) and the respiratory frequency (f). Under normal conditions, the V<sub>E</sub> increases early on primarily due to increases in V<sub>T</sub>, which should at least double over baseline, and reach a peak of approximately 50 to 60 percent of forced vital capacity (FVC) or 70 percent of inspiratory capacity (IC) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The respiratory frequency rises throughout exercise but accelerates at the approach of or just beyond the AT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), the breathing pattern is typically characterized by rapid, shallower breaths, and this corresponds with disease severity. A similar pattern can be seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although patients with COPD are typically experiencing dynamic hyperinflation with this breathing pattern.

Slower heart rate recovery (HRR), such as a fall in heart rate of less than 12 beats per minute (bpm) in the first minute after peak exercise, has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impaired stroke volume augmentation</strong> – Many cardiac diseases result in impaired SV augmentation with peak exercise. Cardiac ischemia leads to reduced SV due to increased left ventricular stiffness and reduction in inotropy during exercise. Impaired contraction or relaxation of cardiac myocytes in systolic or diastolic heart failure, respectively, likewise reduce SV. Regurgitant or stenotic valves impede forward flow of blood during exertion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">O<sub>2</sub> pulse is a physiologic surrogate for SV because VO<sub>2</sub>/HR is equal to SV∙(C<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - C<sub>v</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), based on Fick’s equation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57900" href="/z/d/graphic/57900.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). When there is a problem with SV, cardiac output is maintained by increasing HR. This yields an accelerated HR response at high workloads and a corresponding early plateau (below 80 percent predicted) in the maximal<sub> </sub>O<sub>2 </sub>pulse  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123012" href="/z/d/graphic/123012.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). The O<sub>2</sub> pulse may be limited due to dysfunction of the left ventricle (eg, HFpEF) or the right ventricle (eg, pulmonary arterial hypertension) during exercise. As with chronotropic incompetence, impaired delivery of blood to the tissues leads to an earlier AT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Decreased cardiac output negatively impacts the efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> clearance and oxygen uptake. Abnormal distribution of blood flow in cardiac failure results in relatively low perfusion in areas of the lung that are well ventilated, yielding less efficient clearing of CO<sub>2</sub> (measured by increasing physiologic dead space, lower P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, and elevated V<sub>E</sub>-VCO<sub>2</sub> slope and V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> nadir)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123021" href="/z/d/graphic/123021.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). Similarly, there may be a decrease in the OUES (&lt;1.47), indicating less efficient O<sub>2</sub> uptake with any degree of ventilation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123019" href="/z/d/graphic/123019.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>) [<a href="#rid33">33,34,54-56</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Oscillation in the V<sub>E </sub>versus time curve, known as exercise oscillatory ventilation (EOV), may be more specific than other measurements for intrinsic cardiac disease. This abnormality is thought to be related to excessive circulation time with resultant delayed feedback from arterial CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreceptors on ventilation rate  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123016" href="/z/d/graphic/123016.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10,57</a>].

Many other ECG abnormalities may also be detected. For example, frequent premature ventricular contractions during exercise recovery have been associated with increased mortality, even in those without a known diagnosis of cardiac disease [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Peripheral vascular disease</strong> – Peripheral vascular disease can also lead to exercise intolerance. Here, inability of the peripheral vessels to relax and dilate during exercise leads to inadequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to the tissues, early onset of AT, and exertional dyspnea. The main clue to this during CPET is the excessive rise of diastolic blood pressure (DBP; &gt;20 mmHg above baseline) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2019414180"><span class="h2">Abnormal gas exchange associated with dyspnea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For either patients with ventilatory or cardiovascular limitations to exercise, we examine gas exchange parameters. Disproportionately poor gas exchange compared with other factors indicates impaired V/Q matching (eg. parenchymal destruction, intrapulmonary shunting), pulmonary vascular disease, or both. (See <a class="local">'Gas exchange measurements'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with pulmonary vascular disease (eg, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, thromboembolic disease) or other diseases causing abnormal ventilation-perfusion matching (eg, emphysema, ILD), the most easily identifiable sign of gas exchange abnormalities is the development of hypoxemia or desaturation with exercise  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141717" href="/z/d/graphic/141717.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Additional signs of poor gas exchange are suggested by signs of ventilatory inefficiency. These include reduced P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> during exertion or an increase in V<sub>E</sub> versus VCO<sub>2</sub> slope or elevated nadir of the V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> curve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123021" href="/z/d/graphic/123021.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>) [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

These disorders tend to mimic cardiovascular exercise limitation and may require invasive testing for a definitive diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141717" href="/z/d/graphic/141717.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anemia</strong> – Anemia results in reduced carrying capacity for oxygen, which impairs delivery to the tissues. Anemia leads to a reduced peak VO<sub>2</sub>, an early AT, and low O<sub>2 </sub>pulse without ventilatory limitation or chronotropic incompetence. Poor O<sub>2 </sub>delivery may reduce the OUES, but other gas exchange factors are less likely to be affected. This mimics impaired SV augmentation of the left heart, but without impaired blood delivery to the lungs or pulmonary venous congestion. A complete blood count should always be performed within a month of CPET evaluation to make sure that anemia is not misinterpreted as cardiovascular dysfunction. Iron deficiency also has deleterious consequences on skeletal muscle leading to exercise intolerance beyond the effects of anemia, and intravenous repletion of iron has demonstrated large impacts on exercise capacity in patients in patients with heart failure [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Deconditioning</strong> – Most sedentary patients will demonstrate a normal VO<sub>2MAX</sub> at a decreased workload. However, lack of regular exercise may also lead to inefficient peripheral delivery and extraction of oxygen during exertion, termed deconditioning. Deconditioning is a common cause of dyspnea on exertion [<a href="#rid4">4,14,15</a>] that is reversible with a regular exercise regimen. Patients with deconditioning typically demonstrate mildly reduced peak VO<sub>2</sub>, reduced AT, low O<sub>2</sub> pulse, and low workload with normal ventilatory and chronotropic responses as well as low-normal or normal gas exchange parameters. It is difficult to distinguish these abnormalities from mild cardiovascular limitations; the relatively normal V<sub>E</sub>-VCO<sub>2</sub> slope and V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> nadir may offer the best discriminative ability [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. Exercise echocardiography directly assessing SV augmentation may be helpful if additional certainty is required.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with specific underlying causes of dyspnea may also become deconditioned because of lack of exercise due to the dyspnea on exertion they experience. This is very common among patients with chronic heart or lung disease, which can lead to a mixed CPET result where both deconditioning and underlying disease are contributing to exercise intolerance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Deconditioned patients frequently receive CPET testing as a work-up for dyspnea with exercise following a long period of sedentarism. In these cases, CPET can be reassuring because it can rule out major abnormalities and thereby give the patient and the provider some confidence in the continuing pursuit of an exercise program to overcome the deconditioned state.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Metabolic or mitochondrial myopathies</strong> – Like deconditioning, metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies impair peripheral extraction of oxygen; unlike deconditioning, these abnormalities are not easily reversible and may be severe. Typical abnormalities include impaired VO<sub>2MAX</sub> with an early AT, low O<sub>2</sub> pulse, and a decrease in the OUES (decreased slope of VO<sub>2</sub> versus logV<sub>E</sub>)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef123019" href="/z/d/graphic/123019.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>), similar to what is seen in patients with cardiac limitation. O<sub>2</sub> pulse may be somewhat less likely to plateau in the setting of mitochondrial disease than in cardiac dysfunction [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. More definitive distinguishing signs include verification of normal cardiac output, direct testing of C<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>v</sub>O<sub>2</sub> difference, and serial lactate measurements, all of which require more invasive or specialized exercise testing. Molecular genetic studies or a muscle biopsy may be indicated [<a href="#rid64">64</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dyspnea associated with long COVID-19</strong> – One of the most prominent and troublesome symptoms associated with long COVID-19 is dyspnea on exertion. Several studies using CPET have now been performed trying to elucidate the mechanism involved. For most long COVID-19 patients, it appears that peripheral factors, including abnormalities of autonomic regulation, vascular endothelium, and muscle or mitochondrial function, rather than residual cardiopulmonary disease, play a causal role [<a href="#rid65">65,66</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2144613145"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
