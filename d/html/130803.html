Sports participation was widely curtailed in 2020 to reduce viral spread, while tactical and occupational endeavors have required special precautions and modifications.</p><p>Illness from COVID-19 can cause a range of medical complications with potential intermediate and long-term consequences. For athletes preparing to return to play, residual effects of illness can complicate medical clearance, protocols for returning to play or activity, and monitoring [<a href="#rid2">2,4</a>].</p><p>The primary purpose of this topic is to provide guidance about individual return to play or strenuous activity following infection with COVID-19, with a focus on older adolescent (eg, high school) athletes, recreational and elite adult athletes, tactical personnel, and heavy occupational laborers. How sports leagues and teams should address the COVID-19 pandemic, including team return to play, is not discussed.</p><p>Issues pertaining to children and to general recovery from COVID-19 in adults are discussed separately, as are details about the evaluation and management of specific medical conditions associated with COVID-19 illness (eg, myocarditis, pulmonary embolus, residual pulmonary injury). A small sample of the many UpToDate topics addressing COVID-19 related illness includes the following: (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical features"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127488.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines"</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2376256860"><span class="h1">COVID-19 CLINICAL COURSE AND SEQUELAE IN ATHLETES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our understanding of COVID-19-related illness continues to evolve. While many athletes develop only mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic, others experience persistent symptoms following acute illness [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. For both athletes and non-athletes, recovery varies widely depending upon on the extent and severity of the acute illness, premorbid conditions, and other factors. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129312.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation and management of adults with persistent symptoms following acute illness ("Long COVID")"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2153716845"><span class="h2">Impact of physical fitness on clinical course</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the clinical course of COVID-19 illness varies among athletes, (just as it does among non-athletes), on average, physical fitness appears to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 illness, while physical inactivity is associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>]. The effect of physical inactivity upon the course and severity of COVID-19 illness is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical features", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'</a>.)</p><p>As examples, in a retrospective study of 246 patients (59±12 years, 42 percent male, 75 percent Black) diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome secondary to COVID-19 illness, hospitalization was found to be inversely related to aerobic fitness [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Baseline fitness in peak metabolic equivalents, based on exercise stress testing results obtained within the prior four years, were significantly lower among patients who were hospitalized (6.7±2.8) compared with those not hospitalized (8±2.4) (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.83; 95% CI 0.74-0.92; OR adjusted for major risk factors 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-0.99). In a retrospective, nationwide study of over 65,000 people participating in a physical activity rewards program, those with high physical activity levels (&gt;150 minutes/week) suffered substantially lower morbidity and mortality from complications of COVID-19 infection than those with low physical activity levels (&lt;60 minutes/week) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. High physical activity was associated with lower rates of hospitalization (risk ratio [RR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.63-0.70), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.52-0.66), mechanical ventilation (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.47-0.64), and death (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50-0.68).</p><p>Given evidence that greater physical fitness may mitigate the severity of disease among those who become infected with COVID-19, several researchers and other authorities have called for practical recommendations to promote physical fitness during the pandemic [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H275220148"><span class="h2">Pandemic effect on detraining</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A concern among recreational and elite athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic is the impact of detraining. Several studies report that community lockdowns to prevent viral spread have had adverse effects on physical fitness. As an example, a retrospective study of Spanish students enrolled in 16 universities, and involving a total of 13,754 valid survey responses, described reduced moderate (-29.5 percent) and vigorous (-18.3 percent) physical activity during confinement and increased sedentary time (+52.7 percent) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Multiple small, observational cohort studies report comparable declines in fitness among adolescents [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]. A small case-control study of children reported a substantial decline in the mean maximum oxygen uptake in a post-COVID-19 cohort compared with pre-pandemic controls (39.1 versus 44.7) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Detraining is an important consideration for clinicians to address when providing guidance about return to play [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Return to activity progression'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H513814284"><span class="h2">Cardiovascular complications in athletes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The possible cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 illness present challenges for clinicians caring for athletes preparing to return to play. One concern is myocarditis or other myocardial injury, which in rare cases may develop without symptoms and can be exacerbated by exercise during recovery, possibly precipitating sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiovascular disease, including myocarditis, associated with COVID-19 illness is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129342.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Cardiac manifestations in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Our understanding of the epidemiology of subclinical myocarditis in asymptomatic athletes with COVID-19 and among athletes with mild or moderate disease continues to evolve. Overall, the risk appears to be extremely low. Even among young athletes with persistent or exertional symptoms following infection with COVID-19, the prevalence of significant cardiac complications remains low [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>While several small studies in athlete populations have reported signs consistent with myocarditis using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), other larger studies report a very low incidence among asymptomatic athletes and those with mild disease, including adolescents, and question the utility of using CMR as part of any initial evaluation [<a href="#rid22">22-30</a>]. Of note, while CMR findings can help to establish the diagnosis of myocarditis, sensitivity is variable and time dependent (eg, studies performed late after symptom onset are less likely to show signs of disease), and abnormalities are nonspecific. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4939.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>In an observational study of 789 professional athletes who tested positive for COVID-19, five (0.6 percent) demonstrated evidence of inflammatory heart disease (myocarditis or pericarditis) on CMR [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. All five athletes had manifested symptoms and signs that exceeded mild illness. Among the more than 19,000 collegiate athletes followed as part of a prospective, multicenter observational study, 3018 tested positive for COVID-19 and underwent cardiac evaluation [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Possible cardiac injury was noted in 21 (0.7 percent) of the infected athletes, including 15 (0.5 percent) who underwent CMR based on findings from preliminary testing (electrocardiogram [ECG], serum troponin, and/or transthoracic echocardiography). During a subsequent one-year period of surveillance, only one adverse cardiac event occurred, most likely unrelated to COVID-19 infection [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97687689"><span class="h2">Other medical complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recovering athletes are susceptible to a number of other COVID-19-related complications, including general fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and coagulopathy (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism). However, there is no clinical information specific to athletes addressing these concerns. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129312.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation and management of adults with persistent symptoms following acute illness ("Long COVID")"</a>.)</p><p>Several authors have raised concern about the impact of neurologic and neuromuscular complications on return to play. Athletes recovering from COVID-19 illness may suffer from fatigue, impaired neuromuscular function, and reduced muscle strength, leading to poor performance [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Return to activity progression'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2707366454"><span class="h1">SCHEDULES AND GUIDANCE FOR RETURN TO ACTIVITY AND FULL PLAY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the attached graphics, we provide a flow chart that outlines a symptom-based approach to medical clearance for return to play (RTP) following COVID-19 illness  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131039" href="/d/graphic/131039.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131034" href="/d/graphic/131034.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and a table describing the stages through which an athlete should progress for return to play  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130869" href="/d/graphic/130869.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). These guides can be applied to recreational, occupational, tactical (eg, military), and elite athletes. General guidance about rest and quarantine following exposure or infection with COVID-19 is provided separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139926" href="/d/graphic/139926.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'</a>.)</p><p>COVID-19 illness poses special challenges for determining how athletes can return to intense exercise and full play safely once they are medically cleared to begin exercising [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The process can be complex and requires that clinicians consider the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Safety of the athlete</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Potential risks to the safety of other participants</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional capabilities of the athlete (ie, baseline and current fitness)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional demands of the athlete's sport or occupation (eg, military, first responder)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Legal and regulatory requirements (eg, federal or local government, sport governing body)</p><p></p><p>While there are no evidence-based guidelines to assist decision-making about RTP of the athlete recovering from COVID-19, several authorities recommend refraining from exercise during the acute illness [<a href="#rid2">2,4,36-38</a>]. The duration of subsequent abstention from exercise varies depending on individual factors including illness severity and the presence of cardiopulmonary symptoms [<a href="#rid29">29,39</a>]. We concur with the general guidance provided by groups including the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine and the American College of Cardiology as follows: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic athlete: three days abstinence following positive test</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mild illness: three days abstinence from symptom onset</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate illness or cardiopulmonary symptoms: minimum five days abstinence; evaluation prior to return (note that this period has been reduced from 10 days in previous recommendations)</p><p></p><p>A clinical evaluation is necessary for all athletes recovering from moderate or severe illness or those who experienced cardiopulmonary symptoms prior to returning to exercise. In addition, the athlete should be symptom free and off all symptom-related treatment before beginning a structured return to activity. As loss of taste or smell may persist beyond the recommended period of exercise abstinence, but we do not consider these symptoms when making RTP decisions.</p><p>The period of inactivity before an athlete can begin exercising causes a degree of detraining and increases the risk for potential injury, particularly if the athlete resumes exercise too aggressively [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) of the United States has identified this period as one of special vulnerability. Caution is needed as athletes begin training and sports participation. While monitoring athlete progress, the clinician should pay close attention to training intensity and volume, making adjustments as necessary. (See <a class="local">'Return to activity progression'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2019, the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) and Collegiate Strength and Conditioning Coaches Association (CSCCa) of the United States published guidelines recommending modifications to training schedules to allow for acclimatization and to increase safety [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. These are discussed in more detail below. (See <a class="local">'Strength training'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1925605109"><span class="h1">MEDICAL CLEARANCE IN ATHLETES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The safety and ideal timing for resuming intense exercise after COVID-19 infection is unknown, and no evidence-based guidelines for return to play are available to help clinicians. Several consensus statements based on expert opinion and data from athlete registries promote risk stratification based on the severity of the athlete's illness and other relevant factors [<a href="#rid27">27,29,31,39-41</a>].</p><p>The severity of illness from COVID-19 varies widely with potential effects on many organ systems. Athletes who suffered more severe illness or have major underlying morbidities will likely require additional testing and specialist consultation before they can resume intense training.</p><p>Categories of COVID-19 illness severity are described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131034" href="/d/graphic/131034.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

Although most COVID-19-related myocardial injury occurs in hospitalized patients, there are multiple case reports of myocarditis or presumed myocarditis developing in ambulatory patients. Myocarditis following infection with COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect males under 20 years of age, with a rate of 450 per million, about twice that reported in young females [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Overall, myocarditis remains a rare but serious complication of COVID-19 infection and vaccination. Thus, detection of occult myocarditis or other myocardial injury is a concern when evaluating the cardiovascular system of athletes following COVID-19 illness. </p><p>Myocarditis in the general population, its role in cardiac arrest among athletes, and its association with COVID-19 illness and vaccination are discussed separately, as outlined below. The evaluation and RTP of athletes recovering from COVID-19 illness in whom myocarditis is a concern is discussed here. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sudden cardiac arrest in athletes (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/986.html" rel="external">"Athletes: Overview of sudden cardiac death risk and sport participation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/960.html" rel="external">"Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocarditis in general population (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4939.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4933.html" rel="external">"Myocarditis: Causes and pathogenesis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocarditis and COVID-19 illness and vaccination (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129342.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Cardiac manifestations in adults", section on 'Myocardial injury'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129849.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Vaccines", section on 'Myocarditis'</a>)</p><p></p><p>Myocarditis may rarely be present without symptoms or examination findings.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">"Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds"</a>.)</p><p>We concur with expert consensus documents that recommend further cardiac evaluation of athletes recovering from severe cases of COVID-19 illness and those with symptoms (eg, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations) or signs consistent with myocarditis [<a href="#rid39">39,41</a>]. Cardiac screening is not necessary for athletes recovering from moderate illness without cardiopulmonary symptoms. </p><p>The initial assessment for this population consists of a triad of cardiac testing: electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity troponin), and an echocardiogram. Some guidelines also recommend ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring or exercise stress testing, but none recommends cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) as part of the initial evaluation. Because intense exercise within 48 hours of testing can cause a false-positive result, blood for measuring cardiac biomarkers should not be drawn within this window, and clinicians should confirm this prior to testing. Any finding suggestive of cardiac injury should prompt strict limits on activity (no more than a brisk walk) and referral to a cardiologist with experience assessing athlete's heart and myocarditis.

As examples, for otherwise healthy athletes under age 25 who experienced only mild symptoms, one day per stage may be all that is necessary. Conversely, for athletes over age 40 with a significant comorbidity (eg, type 1 diabetes mellitus) recovering from severe illness (eg, intensive care unit admission) and hoping to return to demanding activity (eg, iron man competition, Masters judo), many weeks per stage may be required. The pace at which athletes progress within and between stages will vary widely; individuals must complete each stage comfortably prior to progressing to the next stage.</p><p>As an additional resource, the United States Department of Defense guidelines for return to activity outline a range of minimum times in each stage that depend upon an initial risk stratification [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].

Athletes who suffered more severe illness or have high-risk morbidities (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coagulopathy) likely require additional testing and specialist consultation before they can resume intense training. (See <a class="local">'Medical clearance in athletes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Our suggested approach to initial medical evaluation and return to play is outlined in the following resources:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A table defines the categories of COVID-19 illness severity for return to play  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131034" href="/d/graphic/131034.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A flow chart outlines our approach to medical clearance for adults and older adolescents returning to play following COVID-19 illness based on the severity of illness and presence of high-risk comorbidities  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131039" href="/d/graphic/131039.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Medical clearance in athletes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A table describes the stages of return to play and what level of activity is permitted at each stage  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130869" href="/d/graphic/130869.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Return to activity progression'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiovascular evaluation</strong> – We recommend that athletes recovering from moderate or severe cases of COVID-19 illness or whose symptoms persist beyond the expected period be evaluated for myocardial injury. Initial assessment for this population consists of an electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarkers (ideally high-sensitivity troponin), and an echocardiogram. Any finding suggestive of myocarditis or other myocardial injury should prompt strict limits on activity (no more than a brisk walk) and referral to a cardiologist with experience assessing athlete's heart and myocarditis. (See <a class="local">'Cardiovascular evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary evaluation</strong> – Patients hospitalized with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia should not resume exercise until given permission by their pulmonologist or another clinician with appropriate expertise. Respiratory failure is defined as an acute hypoxemic condition requiring advanced support (eg, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal life support). (See <a class="local">'Pulmonary evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At 12 weeks after discharge, all patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia that manifested as a consolidation on plain chest radiograph or that required supplemental oxygen or hospitalization should be re-evaluated with a chest radiograph. Those with persistent symptoms need further evaluation as described above. Persistent dyspnea is common among patients recovering from COVID-19 pulmonary infection but may also be due to cardiac or vascular complications (eg, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism). Those who are symptom free and able to perform activities of daily living without breathlessness may begin a gradual, closely monitored return to activity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/129312.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation and management of adults with persistent symptoms following acute illness ("Long COVID")"</a> and <a class="local">'Return to activity progression'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Returning to activity and full play</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring return to play</strong> – Patients cleared to begin return to play require close monitoring of two kinds. The first involves watching for signs of potentially dangerous complications of COVID-19 illness (eg, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism), especially early in the process of return to play. The second involves regular assessment throughout the return to play process of the athlete’s response to increases in activity to ensure safety and appropriate progress. For the latter, close attention should be paid to fatigue, sleep quality, muscle soreness, and psychological stress. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Stages for return to play</strong> – Athletes returning to play after COVID-19 illness progress through five stages  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130869" href="/d/graphic/130869.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Clinicians must exercise judgment and maintain close communication with athletes as they move from Stage II through all subsequent stages. We suggest a minimum of one to two days per stage, but this can and should be modified depending upon the patient's age, severity of COVID-19 illness, comorbidities, and activity goals. (See <a class="local">'Stages of return to play and their duration'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Children and adolescents returning to play</strong> – Children younger than 12 years may progress back to sports and physical education classes according to their own tolerance. For children and adolescents 12 years and older, a gradual return to play may begin once the child has been examined and cleared by an appropriate clinician, the required quarantine period has passed, and the child exhibits no cardiorespiratory symptoms when performing normal activities of daily living. Return to sport should progress gradually over at least three days but may take longer. (See <a class="local">'Children and adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other considerations</strong> – Other aspects of return to play following COVID-19 illness including how to modify aerobic and resistance exercise, awareness of mental health issues, and how wearing a mask affects exercise tolerance are discussed in the text.
