The acute process is self-limited, rarely causes hepatic failure, and usually leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years and can ultimately result in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for liver transplantation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3672.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>This topic addresses the general management of patients with chronic HCV infection. Patient selection for treatment and specific treatment regimens are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16592.html" rel="external">"Management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Initial antiviral therapy in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15795.html" rel="external">"Management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Antiviral retreatment following relapse in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93242.html" rel="external">"Direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GUIDELINES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were released jointly by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2014, are continuously updated, and can be accessed at <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hcvguidelines.org%2F&amp;token=sL%2Bp%2BgWoM5K8OZ3TcR7z2aLRyWCGNBK9vbXZNzy9A7wOhWa41Lo4fh2xvvlb%2BhyX&amp;TOPIC_ID=3673" target="_blank">www.hcvguidelines.org</a> [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The discussion in this topic is generally consistent with those guidelines. </p><p>Other guidelines include treatment recommendations from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. World Health Organization (WHO) also released guidelines in 2014 on screening and treatment of HCV, intended primarily for clinicians and policy-makers in low- and middle-income countries [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Links to these and other guidelines can be found below. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97408452"><span class="h1">PATIENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The objectives of the evaluation of patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of the extent of liver disease. Specifically, identification of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis informs the need for additional monitoring and management. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of viral and host factors that inform the optimal antiviral selection. These factors may include viral genotype, liver fibrosis stage (and signs of decompensated disease in those with cirrhosis), history of prior antiviral treatment, renal function, and concurrent medication use.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identifying comorbidities associated with HCV infection. These include extrahepatic manifestations of chronic HCV infection, such as cryoglobulinemia, HCV-associated renal disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, and autoimmune disorders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additionally, HCV-infected patients should also be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) given the common modes of transmission and the association of these coinfections with more rapid disease progression. HBV reactivation can occur during treatment with a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and has been rarely associated with liver failure and death. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'HBV coinfection'</a> and <a class="local">'Monitoring for toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The evaluation of patients with chronic HCV infection is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89950.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Additional evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">COUNSELING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2929913631"><span class="h2">Psychosocial issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although most patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, the potential sequelae of chronic HCV infection are significant, and this possibility can have important emotional and physical consequences. Counseling and screening for depression should be a major consideration, both at diagnosis and during subsequent follow-up. Many patients benefit from participation in a support group. (See  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/4576.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Hepatitis C (Beyond the Basics)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1285385120"><span class="h2">Active injection drug use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with HCV infection may also have issues with ongoing substance use. Such patients should be counseled on substance use treatment, including psychiatric services or opioid substitution therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89215.html" rel="external">"Continuing care for addiction: Implementation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management"</a>.). </p><p>Active injection drug use is not a contraindication to antiviral therapy, as long as the patient wishes to be treated and is willing and able to adhere to monitoring during treatment. Patient-centered care tailored to the needs of those who use injection drugs may improve treatment completion rates. In a randomized clinical trial among people who inject drugs, an accessible care model that emphasized low-threshold, flexible HCV management co-located with a syringe service program achieved higher HCV cure rates compared with facilitated referral to local clinicians [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1708994273"><span class="h2">Transmission risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transmission of HCV is primarily through exposure to infected blood. Counseling should include discussions about the specific routes of HCV transmission and advice on measures to decrease the risk of transmission to other individuals  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58787" href="/z/d/graphic/58787.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Women of childbearing age may also be concerned about the risk of perinatal transmission. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3675.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Routes of transmission'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3637.html" rel="external">"Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2967141639"><span class="h2">Diet and behaviors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be informed about the natural history of HCV infection and counseled on potentially modifiable factors that are associated with accelerated liver disease, including alcohol use, obesity and insulin resistance, and marijuana use. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3672.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>Because of the association with more rapid progression of liver disease, we suggest complete avoidance of alcohol for HCV-infected individuals. In addition, we encourage weight loss in patients with obesity and cessation of cigarettes and marijuana. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3585.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis C and alcohol", section on 'How much alcohol is too much?'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5371.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Overview of management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7796.html" rel="external">"Cannabis use disorder: Clinical features, screening, diagnosis, and treatment"</a>.)</p><p>We also advise patients that two to three cups of coffee daily can be beneficial to liver health. Coffee consumption (more than two cups per day) has been associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization and mortality from a number of chronic liver diseases including chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and alcoholic liver disease [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4254442818"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antiviral therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (see <a class="local">'Antiviral therapy'</a> below). With current antiviral therapies, HCV is relatively easily treated and can be eliminated in almost all patients. Other general measures in the management of patients with chronic HCV include symptom management, dose adjustment of medications, and preventing complications of cirrhosis if present.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Fatigue</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients with HCV infection complain of fatigue. The cause is uncertain and may be difficult to ascribe to liver disease alone rather than other comorbidities such as depression. Fatigue and overall quality of life improve in some patients who have a sustained virologic response (SVR) following antiviral therapy, although the improvements may be modest [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Symptom alleviation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Dose adjustments of medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prescription and over-the-counter medications usually do not require a dose adjustment in HCV-infected patients who have normal hepatic function. Many patients voice concern about taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> due to its association with liver injury when taken in high doses. Patients do not need to avoid acetaminophen, but we suggest that the dose of acetaminophen not exceed 2 g per 24 hours. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/340.html" rel="external">"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>However, for HCV-infected patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, dose adjustments or avoidance of certain medications may be warranted. In particular, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be hepatotoxic and should be <strong>avoided</strong> in patients with advanced liver disease. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121754.html" rel="external">"Overview of medication adjustments for adult patients with cirrhosis", section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p>While statins are frequently withheld from patients with chronic liver disease, available data fail to show an increased risk of adverse effects in patients with compensated chronic liver disease, suggesting that statin use is safe in patients with stable HCV infection [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In addition, there are some data that suggest statin use is associated with lower fibrosis progression rate and decreased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>].</p><p>Certain medications, including over-the-counter agents, have interactions with various direct-acting antivirals and may need to be adjusted during therapy. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93242.html" rel="external">"Direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3321525340"><span class="h2">Vaccination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to standard adult vaccinations, HCV-infected patients who are not immune to hepatitis A or B virus should be vaccinated against these viruses. HCV-infected patients with chronic liver disease should also receive pneumococcal vaccination. Details on these vaccinations are discussed elsewhere  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130" href="/z/d/graphic/62130.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3891.html" rel="external">"Immunizations for adults with chronic liver disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HCV-infected patients who are found to have advanced fibrosis should be monitored for the development of complications. This includes evaluating for clinical signs of liver failure (including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or bleeding from gastroesophageal varices) as well as laboratory testing to identify hepatic dysfunction (hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, or hypoprothrombinemia). Additionally, certain patients with cirrhosis should be screened for the presence of gastroesophageal varices by upper endoscopy. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis should undergo surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because HCC occurs at a rate of 1 to 4 percent per year. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1263.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis", section on 'Preventing complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3583.html" rel="external">"Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Because of reports of hepatic decompensation, including some with fatal outcomes, among patients with cirrhosis who were treated with HV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, we favor additional evaluation in certain patients with cirrhosis prior to treatment with regimens containing protease inhibitors [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Direct-acting antivirals'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1818295792"><span class="h1">ANTIVIRAL THERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9643992"><span class="h2">Goals of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is to eradicate HCV RNA, which is predicted by attainment of a sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as an undetectable RNA level 12 weeks following the completion of therapy. </p><p>An SVR is associated with a 97 to 100 percent chance of being HCV RNA negative during long-term follow-up and can therefore be considered cure of the HCV infection [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Attaining an SVR (with direct-acting antiviral [DAA] regimens as well as with interferon-based regimens) has been associated with decreases in all-cause mortality, liver-related death, need for liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma rates, and liver-related complications, even among those patients with advanced liver fibrosis [<a href="#rid17">17-32</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection", section on 'Benefits of treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9644074"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with virologic evidence of chronic HCV infection (ie, detectable HCV viral level over a six-month period) should be considered for treatment. The introduction of DAAs, drugs that target specific nonstructural proteins of HCV and thus disrupt viral replication and infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94365" href="/z/d/graphic/94365.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93884" href="/z/d/graphic/93884.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), has revolutionized therapy of HCV infection. Highly effective, well-tolerated, all-oral regimens are now the treatment of choice for the vast majority of HCV-infected patients who have access to these agents. The evaluation and selection of patients for antiviral therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15832.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, the high prices of these all-oral antiviral regimens have garnered substantial attention among medical and lay communities. Several studies have suggested that these regimens, even at their introductory high cost, are cost-effective for many populations, including those with genotype 1 infection or advanced fibrosis, because of their superior efficacy in clinical trials [<a href="#rid33">33-37</a>]. Availability of additional agents has made most DAA therapies more affordable to patient and third party payers, and thus more patients have access to them.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9644102"><span class="h2">Regimen selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antiviral therapy of HCV has rapidly evolved following the introduction and proliferation of DAAs that offer the potential for highly effective, interferon-free regimens that are highly active against all genotypes. Regimen selection depends on whether the patient is undergoing initial therapy for chronic HCV infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93587" href="/z/d/graphic/93587.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) or has relapsed infection following prior antiviral treatment, and it is discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16592.html" rel="external">"Management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Initial antiviral therapy in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15795.html" rel="external">"Management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: Antiviral retreatment following relapse in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2369791832"><span class="h1">MONITORING DURING ANTIVIRAL THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical assessment during treatment with an interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen focuses on adherence to the regimen and identification of adverse effects. DAAs are generally well tolerated. Specific side effects are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93242.html" rel="external">"Direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H382915690"><span class="h2">Viral monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monitoring viral levels during treatment with DAA regimens has minimal prognostic value, as almost all patients without cirrhosis in the large DAA trials achieve an undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral level by four weeks of treatment, and failure to achieve that threshold does not accurately predict failure to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>]. Thus, the main reasons to check viral levels during therapy are to assess adherence to the regimen and to document the treatment course and virologic response in case patients relapse and warrant retreatment. Given the expense of the medicines and the potential risk of viral resistance with inappropriate use, we check HCV RNA quantitative testing at week 4 in clinical practice. The joint guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) additionally recommend rechecking HCV RNA quantitative testing at week 6 if the week 4 level is detectable and discontinuing therapy if the level has increased by &gt;1 log [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Although there are no direct clinical data to support this practice, we agree that this is an appropriate approach. </p><p>The clinical value of a week 12 (or end of treatment) viral level is uncertain, and most providers do not routinely check it.

It is unclear what proportion of these represent cases of HBV reactivation or complications in patients with existing advanced liver disease (including inappropriate use of protease inhibitors in patients with decompensated disease), situations in which the risk of liver failure is higher than the general population.

Thus, some practitioners also check the viral load at 24 weeks to ensure maintenance of SVR.
