While acute lumbosacral radiculopathy is often extremely painful, symptoms may spontaneously improve in many cases. As examples, the clinical course may variably wax and wane when due to lumbar spinal stenosis from degenerative arthritis and may be self-limited when due to disc herniation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Initial conservative treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and activity modification are the mainstays of treatment. Patients should avoid pain-producing activities. However, engaging in a regimen of progressive mobilization of the impacted limb(s) may further reduce pain and duration of symptoms.</p><p>For patients managed with initial conservative treatment, we suggest a one- to two-week trial of NSAIDS or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and activity modification before reassessing whether or not continued conservative treatment or adjunctive treatments are warranted. Inadequate clinical response to initial treatment over time guides decision-making.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Nonopioid analgesics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical experience suggests that short-term treatment with either an NSAID or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> is useful for patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. For most patients, we start with a one- to two-week course of either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> 400 to 800 mg orally every eight hours or acetaminophen 650 mg orally every six hours. NSAIDs may be preferred for patients without significant renal, gastric, or cardiovascular comorbidity, while acetaminophen can be used for patients without hepatic compromise who cannot tolerate NSAIDs. Nonopioid analgesics are discussed in further detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126633.html" rel="external">"Pharmacologic management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Nonopioid analgesics'</a>.)</p><p>However, the effectiveness of NSAIDs and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> for acute lumbosacral radiculopathy has not been firmly established. As an example, a 2016 meta-analysis included 10 randomized controlled trials with over 1600 participants that evaluated NSAIDs versus placebo or other medications for sciatica; seven of the trials enrolled only patients with acute sciatica of &lt;3 weeks duration [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. There was no significant effect of NSAIDs for pain reduction, but NSAIDs led to a better global improvement compared with placebo. The quality of the evidence in this analysis was low. Other studies reached similar conclusions [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Activity modification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Activity modification is as important as analgesic treatment in the management of acute radiculopathy. The goals are to lessen nerve root impingement and to avoid activities that exacerbate pain.</p><p>We advise patients to reduce exacerbating physical activity, typically during the first week after symptom onset. Patients often identify pain-relieving positions for themselves. Some individuals report that crouching, reclining, or lying in certain positions in bed provide meaningful pain relief. Others find that recumbency in bed is associated with increased pain. Such patients may prefer to be up and around, even going about light work duties.</p><p>Modification or avoidance of activity does not imply prolonged complete bed rest. After the first week or otherwise when the acute symptoms decrease, we recommend resuming modest physical activity as tolerated. Randomized trials of patients with acute lumbosacral radicular syndromes have found no significant difference in outcome for treatment with bed rest versus watchful waiting [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] or bed rest versus physical therapy [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Similarly, a systematic review of these studies found no benefit with bed rest [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3489345729"><span class="h2">Adjunctive treatments if initial therapy fails</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients whose symptoms persist or who report inadequate response to initial conservative treatment, we suggest continuing initial conservative treatments and adding adjunctive treatments, including a trial of physical therapy. Selection of other modalities depends upon severity of symptoms and patient preferences.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Physical therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical or manual therapies are often tried for patients with persistent symptoms that are mild or moderate in nature. The optimal timing of referral to physical therapy remains unclear, as does the optimal frequency of visits and duration of therapy. In general, physical therapy in the first one to two weeks is not recommended because patients with mild symptoms are likely to improve on their own while patients with very severe symptoms cannot participate in exercise therapy. Given the generally favorable natural history of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy, it is reasonable to delay physical therapy until symptoms have persisted for three weeks.</p><p>Although many patients report benefit with physical therapy, data supporting its use are limited. In one trial, patients assigned to physical therapy plus usual care, including advice regarding activity modification, reported greater symptomatic improvement at six months than those assigned to usual care alone [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Physical therapy also provided greater symptom relief at one year without higher rates of health care utilization, need for advanced imaging with magnetic resonance imaging, or surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7780.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute low back pain", section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the clinical experience of some experts, systemic glucocorticoid treatment may provide partial pain relief for select patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. Acknowledging that any benefit is likely modest, one author of this topic employs a course of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (60 to 80 mg daily) for five to seven days for patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy who do not respond well to analgesics and activity modification. This is followed by a rapid taper to discontinuation over the following 7 to 14 days. However, the other authors generally do not use systemic glucocorticoids in this setting.</p><p>The available evidence suggests that systemic glucocorticoid therapy has either limited benefit or no benefit [<a href="#rid9">9-15</a>]. A 2022 systemic review of clinical trials on systemic glucocorticoids for low back pain that included data on three trials of patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy found modest improvements in pain but not function in short-term follow up [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Similarly, a 2017 systematic review and practice guideline from the American College of Physicians evaluated six randomized trials of moderate quality and concluded that systemic glucocorticoids have no benefit on pain and minimal or no functional benefit in patients with radicular low back pain [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In one of the larger randomized controlled trials included in the systematic review, 269 patients who had radicular pain for three months or less were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (five days each of 60, 40, and 20 mg per day) or placebo [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. At 3 and 52 weeks, the improvement in disability scores was modestly higher in the prednisone group, a result that was statistically significant but of marginal clinical importance. There was no difference between the groups in pain scores during follow-up and no difference in the rate of lumbar spine surgery at 52 weeks.</p><p>Major side effects associated with systemic glucocorticoids include elevated blood pressure, mood disorders, psychosis, insomnia, gastritis, ulcer formation, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia, bone loss, and heightened risk of infections. Some of these side effects are both dose and duration dependent and are more likely to occur with long-term glucocorticoid use. Patients taking glucocorticoids in combination with NSAIDs may require prophylaxis against gastrointestinal bleeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/35.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2264415402"><span class="h3">Options of limited utility</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Opioids</strong> – We generally do <strong>not</strong> give opioids to most patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy except for those with severe intractable pain unresponsive to other therapies and who are awaiting mechanism-specific treatment. (See <a class="local">'Patients with disc herniation or spinal stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Opioid therapy is commonly considered for patients with severe pain that is inadequately controlled with NSAIDs and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>. However, no high-quality trials have evaluated opioids specifically for acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. We and many experts oppose the use of opiates for acute radiculopathy given the lack of proven efficacy, the potential for serious side effects, and the potential for misuse and abuse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, if opioids are used, measures to reduce the risk of dependency and addiction include the following [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Using short-acting opioid analgesics for the treatment of acute pain only when the severity of the pain is reasonably assumed to warrant their use</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Starting with the lowest possible effective dose</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prescribing no more than a short course of opioid analgesics for acute pain or no more than three days (some would allow for up to two weeks)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Avoiding initial treatment with long-acting or extended-release opioid analgesics</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Adverse effects of opiates include sedation, confusion, nausea, and constipation. Respiratory depression is an issue at higher doses but rarely at the doses used for acute low back pain. As with other medications, older patients are more susceptible to these adverse effects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The use of opioids for treatment of non-cancer pain is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93598.html" rel="external">"Use of opioids in the management of chronic non-cancer pain", section on 'Indications for opioid therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benzodiazepines and antispasmodic agents</strong> – We generally do not use benzodiazepines or antispasmodic agents (classified as muscle relaxants) for acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. In our clinical experience, muscle relaxants do not provide a significant benefit over nonopioid analgesic medications. Their efficacy has not been demonstrated, and they would be expected to have little benefit for pain arising from the compressed nerve root [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidural glucocorticoids</strong> – Epidural glucocorticoid injections may provide modest transient benefit for amelioration of back and leg pain in patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. In a trial of 141 patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy, patients assigned to glucocorticoid injections had more reduced leg pain at three months than those assigned to placebo, but outcomes between groups were similar for leg pain at six months as well as back pain and physical functioning at all time points [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Given the usually self-limited natural history of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy and the availability of alternatives, epidural glucocorticoid injections are generally not recommended during the first four weeks of symptoms of lumbosacral radiculopathy. After weighing risks and benefits, their use may be reasonable for selected patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy who have not improved with conservative treatment over six weeks. However, they provide no benefit beyond three months [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. The risks and benefits of this approach are discussed separately.

The purpose of surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is to relieve symptoms due to compression or inflammation of affected nerve roots. The surgery involves either partial or complete removal of the herniated disc.</p><p>In the setting of progressive neurologic impairment, we recommend urgent surgical consultation. For patients without progressive neurologic impairment but with persistent severe symptoms, the decision to have surgery requires assessing whether a clinically meaningful reduction in pain and/or disability is more likely to occur spontaneously or with surgery.
