         Cyanotic lesions comprise approximately one-third of potentially fatal forms of congenital heart disease (CHD) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Critical CHD is defined as lesions requiring surgery or catheter-based intervention in the first year of life. This includes both cyanotic and noncyanotic lesions as summarized in the table (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Early recognition, emergency stabilization, and transport to an appropriate cardiac care center are essential steps to ensuring optimal outcomes for newborns with these lesions.

         The evaluation and initial management of cyanotic CHD in the newborn are presented here. An overview of cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn, the approach to identifying newborns with critical CHD, and the use of pulse oximetry screening to detect CHD are discussed separately:

         A standard obstetric ultrasound examination includes assessment of the four chambers and ventricular outflow tracts of the fetal heart. While prenatal screening detects many cases of CHD, its sensitivity is highly variable depending on operator expertise, gestational age, fetal position, and type of defect. As a result, prenatal ultrasonography will miss some patients with cyanotic CHD. Prenatal screening and diagnosis are discussed in detail separately. (See

         In affected neonates who are not identified by prenatal ultrasonography, cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) may be suspected based upon history, physical findings, pulse oximetry screening, chest radiography, and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings (

         Central cyanosis caused by reduced arterial oxygen saturation is generally perceptible when the reduced hemoglobin level exceeds 3 g/dL (

         The physical examination may be useful in differentiating CHD from other cyanotic disorders, such as respiratory disease or sepsis, which have overlapping clinical findings. Once a cardiac etiology is determined, the examination also provides clues to the underlying specific cardiac defect (

         Blood pressure gradient – A blood pressure gradient between the arms and legs, or weakened or absent femoral pulses, suggests left ventricular dysfunction associated with severe coarctation of the aorta or interrupted aortic arch. If the ductus arteriosus is widely patent, no gradient may be detected between the arms and legs in these disorders. (See

         Tachycardia and hypotension – Peripheral cyanosis associated with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension often suggests sepsis. However, it is also important to consider left-heart obstructive lesions with heart failure such as HLHS, critical aortic stenosis, and severe coarctation of the aorta in the differential diagnosis of peripheral cyanosis.

         In cyanotic neonates, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (ie, pulse oximetry) should be measured from preductal (right hand) and postductal sites (right or left foot). Oxygen saturation values are reduced with central cyanosis and usually normal with peripheral cyanosis. A difference in values at the two sites identifies patients with differential cyanosis. The routine use of pulse oximetry in the newborn period to screen for critical CHD disease has been shown to be effective for identifying infants who are not detected prenatally. The approach is summarized in the algorithm and is discussed in greater detail separately (

         In transposition of the great arteries, the pulmonary artery is located posterior and directly behind the aorta. Thus, the aortic component of S2 is loud because of its anterior location, and the softer pulmonary component is often inaudible. (See

         A soft outflow systolic murmur is heard in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, HLHS, or truncus arteriosus. In all of these lesions, the cardiac output crosses a single semilunar valve and the volume of blood flow causes the associated murmur. Some patients with truncus arteriosus also have a diastolic murmur of truncal valve regurgitation. (See

          Pulmonary vascular markings
         </strong>
         – The pattern of pulmonary blood flow depends upon the specific cardiac lesion. Although decreased pulmonary vascular markings occur in most cyanotic CHD lesions, they are increased in patients with truncus arteriosus or mixing lesions, such as common atrioventricular canal, as pulmonary vascular resistance falls after delivery.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In D-TGA, vascular markings may be asymmetric. In this condition, the right pulmonary artery branches from the main pulmonary artery along the long axis of the left ventricle, while the left pulmonary artery branches acutely. This anatomy often promotes preferential increased flow to the right lung and asymmetric blood flow with reduced markings in the left lung. (See

          Situs of aortic arch
         </strong>
         – The situs of the aortic arch is defined by which of the mainstem bronchi the arch crosses. This is best determined by the indentation of the trachea on the anteroposterior image, indicating the side towards which the aortic arch is coursing. The normal anatomy is a left-sided aortic arch with indentation of the left side of the trachea as the arch crosses over the left mainstem bronchus.

         In cyanotic CHD due to right-to-left shunting, blood in the pulmonary veins is fully saturated with oxygen in ambient air. Administering higher concentrations of inspired oxygen increases the amount of dissolved oxygen but has minimal effect on oxygen tension levels because there is no effect on the deoxygenated blood that is shunted to the systemic circulation.

         Echocardiography, including imaging, and pulsed and color Doppler interrogation of flow patterns provides a definitive diagnosis of CHD with information on cardiac anatomy and function. Echocardiography should be performed in newborns with central cyanosis if the initial evaluation does not reveal another clear cause for the low oxygen level (eg, lung disease). Other indications for echocardiography include blood pressure or pulse differential between upper and lower extremities, cardiomegaly, or pathologic murmur.

For infants with ductal-dependent lesions, closure of the ductus arteriosus can precipitate rapid clinical deterioration with significant life-threatening changes (ie, severe metabolic acidosis, seizures, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, or end-organ injury). As a result, infants with ductal-dependent lesions are at increased risk for death and significant morbidity unless interventions are initiated to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus for ductal-dependent lesions, ensure adequate mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, or relieve obstructed blood flow.

Thus, NEC is not an adverse effect of PGE1 per se but rather a consequence of maintaining the patent ductus. Infants receiving PGE1 should be monitored for clinical evidence of NEC (eg, abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, bloody stools). We do not routinely withhold enteral feeds as a preventive measure in term infants receiving PGE1, since the risk of NEC does not appear to be increased with enteral feeding [

However, in some cases, it may be prudent to withhold feeds if the infant will be transported or if the airway has not been secured, given the potential need for intubation if apnea occurs. For infants who are receiving enteral feeds and develop signs of NEC, feeding should be discontinued. Diagnosis and management of NEC are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

These include obstructive (usually infradiaphragmatic) total anomalous pulmonary venous connection or various conditions associated with a restrictive atrial septum (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome [HLHS], cor triatriatum, severe mitral stenosis or atresia, or D-transposition of the great arteries [D-TGA] associated with restrictive atrial shunting).

          Transport on PGE1
         </strong>
         – When it is necessary to transfer a neonate receiving PGE1 from the birth hospital to another medical facility with pediatric cardiology expertise, the care team should anticipate the potential for apnea during transport. At the author's institution, our usual practice is to electively intubate and mechanically ventilate infants prior to transport if they are receiving PGE1 because of the risk for apnea. However, practice varies and intubation is not routinely performed by all tertiary care transport teams.

         In a retrospective study of 300 infants with ductal-dependent CHD who underwent transport on PGE1, three-quarters were intubated prior to transport (42 percent electively, 27 percent because of respiratory failure that occurred prior to starting PGE1, and 5 percent because of apnea that occurred after starting PGE1) [

         Balloon atrial septostomy can relieve marked cyanosis in patients with D-TGA associated with restrictive atrial shunting and in patients with a restrictive atrial septum associated with left-sided obstructive disease. In patients with D-TGA, this procedure can be performed at the bedside under echocardiographic guidance. (See

         Balloon valvuloplasty can be effective in patients with critical pulmonary stenosis or aortic stenosis. Selected patients with pulmonary atresia are also candidates for balloon valvuloplasty if the obstruction is membranous, the tricuspid annulus and right ventricular size are adequate to support a two-ventricle repair, and the coronary circulation does not depend upon the right ventricle [

          Importance
         </strong>
         – Cyanotic cardiac lesions account for approximately one-third of potentially fatal cases of congenital heart disease (CHD) (

         <strong>
          Prenatal diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Prenatal ultrasound identifies many forms of CHD. However, some cases of cyanotic CHD are not detected prenatally, because the sensitivity of the test is highly variable and depends on operator expertise, gestational age, fetal position, and type of defect. (See

         <strong>
          Postnatal diagnosis
         </strong>
         – In neonates with cyanotic CHD who are not identified prenatally, a clinical diagnosis may be suspected based on history, physical findings, pulse oximetry screening, chest radiography, and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79941" href="/z/d/graphic/79941.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The diagnosis is confirmed with echocardiography. (See

         </span>
         The history may identify maternal or perinatal conditions and a family history of CHD that are risk factors for CHD (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103088" href="/z/d/graphic/103088.html" rel="external">
          table 4

         The physical examination may provide information that differentiates CHD from other cyanotic disorders such as respiratory disease or sepsis and may also suggest specific cardiac defects (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79941" href="/z/d/graphic/79941.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Physical findings associated with CHD include an abnormal heart rate, heart sounds, pathologic murmurs, blood pressure gradient between the upper and lower extremities, and hepatomegaly. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'

         The routine use of pulse oximetry in the newborn period to screen for critical CHD has been shown to be effective for identifying infants who are not detected prenatally (

         A chest radiograph may help differentiate between cardiac and pulmonary etiologies for neonatal cyanosis. Abnormal findings in the lung fields are indicative of a pulmonary cause, whereas increased heart size, abnormal heart shape, and a right-sided aortic arch are suggestive of CHD. (See

          Confirming the diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis of CHD and information on cardiac anatomy and function. Echocardiography should be performed if the initial evaluation does not reveal another clear cause for the low oxygen level (eg, lung disease). Other indications for echocardiography include blood pressure or pulse differential between upper and lower extremities, cardiomegaly, or pathologic murmur. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Echocardiography'

          Initial management

         For infants with ductal-dependent CHD, we recommend prostaglandin E1 (PGE1;
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13353" href="/z/d/drug information/13353.html" rel="external">

         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">
          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). If echocardiography is readily available and is performed promptly, PGE1 infusion can be started once the diagnosis of a ductal-dependent lesion is confirmed. However, if echocardiography is not readily available and there is strong clinical suspicion for ductal-dependent CHD based on the initial evaluation, PGE1 infusion should be started empirically while awaiting echocardiographic confirmation. If it is necessary to transfer a neonate with cyanotic CHD who is receiving prostaglandin infusion, the care team should anticipate the potential for apnea during transport. At the author's institution, we typically intubate and mechanically ventilate infants prior to transport in this setting. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prostaglandin E1'

         Some infants with cyanotic CHD may require cardiac catheter interventions. These include palliative procedures that reduce cyanosis by improved mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood (eg, balloon atrial septostomy) or corrective procedures that relieve obstructive blood flow (balloon valvuloplasty). (See

         Because bacterial sepsis is another important cause of cyanosis in neonates, appropriate cultures should be obtained and empiric antibiotic therapy initiated until a definitive diagnosis is established. (See
