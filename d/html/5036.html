(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant", section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p>There are several publications that describe the newborn neurologic examination [<a href="#rid1">1-15</a>]. The discussion on the neonatal neurologic assessment presented here is based upon a review of the literature and the experience of the author. Other aspects of the routine assessment of the newborn are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of the neurologic examination are to recognize emergent and treatable issues like status epilepticus, assist in localization of the disturbance, establish a diagnosis, and, to some extent, help predict the long-term outcome [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. A reliable neurologic examination can be performed within the first six hours of life [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The following factors may influence the results of the neurologic examination and must therefore be taken into consideration:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Conceptional age (CA; ie, gestational age [GA] plus postnatal age) of the infant − The normal neurologic examination changes with maturation. In particular, passive tone and posture vary with GA and are used by the Ballard score to assign GA  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78670" href="/d/graphic/78670.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58241" href="/d/graphic/58241.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

Newborns on a therapeutic hypothermia protocol for perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy may be on a cooling blanket, with core body temperature being maintained at 34°C. Pharmacologically induced skeletal muscle paralysis may be utilized for ventilatory management and can influence the assessment of eye movements, motor function, or reflexes. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain assessment by identifying clinical markers for pain, such as changes in facial expression or crying, and elevations in heart rate or blood pressure, is imperative. Close to 20 percent of newborn infants experience pain during the delivery process or shortly thereafter. This aspect of the newborn assessment is frequently overlooked, yet can impact feeding, sleep, and parent-child interactions [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5021.html" rel="external">"Assessment of pain in neonates", section on 'Pain assessment'</a>.) </p><p></p><p>A collection of videos depicting elements of the neurologic examination in infants can be viewed on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fneurologicexam.med.utah.edu%2Fpediatric%2Fhtml%2Fhome_exam.html&amp;token=UmjdbsfyDQfwe2ThaPqop%2FqTpaA78huxiP9N5VTlLsxnfxz4ykKe8yW6BG6N6yAnB6Ih%2B2v4O8dDx4GpYd5Xg17PstVXwt20lUXncrduvtg%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5036" target="_blank">Pediatric NeuroLogic Exam website</a> [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Other components of the general newborn assessment are discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Passive tone/posture'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Level of alertness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The neurologic examination varies depending upon the following five levels of alertness (state).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quiet sleep (equivalent to nonrapid eye movement sleep in older infants)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active sleep (equivalent to rapid eye movement sleep in older infants)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Awake/drowsy (eyes open without gross movements)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alert</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Crying</p><p></p><p>As an example, muscle tone is diminished during active sleep compared with quiet sleep. It increases in the alert infant and is maximum in a hungry, crying infant.</p><p>The optimal time for neurologic assessment is when the infant is quiet and awake, which is typically after feeding but before the infant has fallen back to sleep. In extremely preterm infants (GA before 28 weeks), it may be difficult to differentiate between the various behavioral states [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Serial neurologic examinations are sometimes necessary for comprehensive assessment. </p><p>An altered level of alertness is commonly observed with acute neurologic dysfunction in the neonate [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. It may manifest as diminished or absent response to arousal stimuli, such as persistent and gentle shaking, perioral tactile stimulation, pinching, shining a light in the eyes, or ringing a bell.</p><p>The following classification of altered alertness states for infants greater than 28 and 30 weeks gestation is based upon the neonatal response to arousal maneuvers and a more noxious stimulus, such as sternal rub or pressure on the supraorbital nerve [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Normal − The infant appears awake, and has normal arousal and noxious stimuli responses.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mild stupor (lethargic) − The infant appears sleepy, with slightly diminished arousal and noxious stimuli responses.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate stupor − The infant is unresponsive, with moderately diminished arousal and noxious stimuli responses.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Deep stupor − The infant is unresponsive, with an absent arousal response and a markedly diminished reaction to noxious stimuli.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coma − The infant is unresponsive, with absent arousal and noxious stimuli responses.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2896149971"><span class="h4">Encephalopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Altered levels of alertness are seen in infants with cortical dysfunction, including neonates with perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. For these patients, initial evaluation should be carried out quickly to determine whether or not they qualify for therapeutic hypothermia that includes using the modified Sarnat scoring system examination to assess severity of encephalopathy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119017" href="/d/graphic/119017.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6216.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy", section on 'Rapid assessment'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Head</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The examination includes measuring the occipitofrontal circumference, noting the skull shape, presence of abnormal hair patterns, scalp defects, and unusual lesions or protuberances such as caput succedaneum or cephalohematoma. Additional evaluation includes transillumination with a bright light source and auscultation with a stethoscope for bruits. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant", section on 'Head'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Head size</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) should be measured at its maximum using a cloth tape. The OFC should be measured at its maximum circumference using a cloth tape. The tape should be positioned in the front just above the nasion (ie, bridge of the nose where the frontal and nasal bones of the skull meet), and in the back, across the external occipital protuberance  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70799" href="/d/graphic/70799.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). At 40 weeks gestation, the average OFC is 35 cm (10<sup>th</sup> to 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, 33 to 37 cm).</p><p>Microcephaly, defined as an OFC more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean (&lt;3<sup>rd</sup> percentile), is usually due to a genetic abnormality or toxic, metabolic, or intrauterine infections (eg, Zika virus or toxoplasmosis) that affect cell proliferation and migration and myelination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61045" href="/d/graphic/61045.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75479" href="/d/graphic/75479.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2839.html" rel="external">"Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Microcephaly'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2839.html" rel="external">"Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, macrocephaly is defined as an OFC greater than 2 SD above the mean (&gt;97<sup>th</sup> percentile). Macrocephaly is caused by an increase in size of any of the components of the cranium, such as the brain parenchyma, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or bone, or may be associated with increased intracranial pressure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65812" href="/d/graphic/65812.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2849.html" rel="external">"Macrocephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Fontanel</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The fontanels should be palpated, preferably with the infant in the sitting position. For consistency, repeat assessments should be conducted with the infant in the same position. The following findings may be associated with a specific neurologic condition.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anterior fontanel tends to be small in infants with microcephaly, and enlarged in those with hydrocephalus, megalencephaly, hypothyroidism, or peroxisomal disorders, such as cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A tense and bulging fontanel in an infant who is placed in the sitting position and is not crying may indicate raised intracranial pressure, which can occur in patients with subdural hematoma, bacterial meningitis, or cerebral edema. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5031.html" rel="external">"Neonatal birth injuries", section on 'Subdural hemorrhage'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6017.html" rel="external">"Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Neurologic complications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Sutures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The principal sutures of the skull (sagittal, coronal, lambdoid, and metopic) should be palpated. Passage through the birth canal may result in molding, a temporary asymmetry of the skull caused by overlapping or overriding of the sutures. However, an asymmetric skull that persists for longer than two to three weeks after birth, or a persistent palpable ridge along the suture line is abnormal, and might suggest craniosynostosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2910.html" rel="external">"Overview of craniosynostosis", section on 'Categorization of cranial deformities'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Scalp swelling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Edema or bleeding into various compartments within the scalp and skull may be due to injuries that occur during delivery, particularly vacuum assisted extraction. These injuries include caput succedaneum, cephalohematoma, and subgaleal hematoma, and are discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53176" href="/d/graphic/53176.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5031.html" rel="external">"Neonatal birth injuries", section on 'Extracranial injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Auscultation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Auscultation of the head may detect a venous hum, which is a benign finding. However, an asymmetric systolic-diastolic bruit that is heard over the eyeballs and anterior fontanel may indicate the presence of an arteriovenous malformation involving the vein of Galen. The bruit is best heard by using the bell of the stethoscope. Vein of Galen malformations may present with high-output cardiac failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Transillumination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transillumination of the head is performed by placing a bright light source with a dark rim on to the scalp surface in a darkened room. The normal zone of transillumination is generally 1 to 2 cm from the rim of light, and is somewhat larger over the frontal than the parieto-occipital regions. Increased transillumination suggests a fluid-filled, intracranial lesion such as hydrocephalus, hydranencephaly, or porencephalic cyst.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Spine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The spine is inspected and palpated to detect abnormalities, such as a neural tube defect. Myelomeningocele is a readily apparent neurulation defect that is most often localized to the lumbar region, and less frequently at the thoracic or cervical level. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6170.html" rel="external">"Myelomeningocele (spina bifida): Anatomy, clinical manifestations, and complications"</a>.)</p><p>The gluteal folds should be separated to determine presence of a sacrococcygeal sinus, asymmetric gluteal cleft, lipoma, hemangioma, or sacral dimple suggestive of a congenital dermal sinus. Other findings indicative of a post-neurulation defect include a tuft of hair or discoloration of the skin over the spine  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72298" href="/d/graphic/72298.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Post-neurulation defects also include tethered cord syndrome and diastematomyelia (split cord). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant", section on 'Trunk and spine'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Associated findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following findings may be associated with a congenital disorder with neurologic abnormalities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypopigmented skin patches may be associated with tuberous sclerosis.

This will elicit movement of the infant's trunk and hips towards the side of the stimulus.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36"><span class="h1">SENSORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The neonatal assessment of sensation is challenging because it is difficult to accurately determine an infant's response to sensory stimuli. As a result, sensory assessment is limited or not generally performed as part of the neonatal neurologic examination.</p><p>Perioral tactile sensation can be evaluated by the rooting response in which gentle stroking of the cheek results in the infant turning towards the stimulus with an open mouth ready to latch onto the object [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In a patient with a spinal cord lesion, there may be loss of pinprick sensation on the trunk or neck, below the level of the lesion. This is probably the one situation in the newborn where testing sensation with a pinprick provides useful information. Otherwise, testing in the newborn with pinpricks provides little useful information.</p><p>Assessment of pain is also difficult in the newborn and is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5021.html" rel="external">"Assessment of pain in neonates"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H37"><span class="h1">BEHAVIORAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of neonatal behavior assesses higher cortical function. Several behavioral neonatal assessment tools have been developed, including the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). The NBAS includes 27 behavioral responses and 20 reflex items, and takes approximately 20 minutes to administer [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The following two key elements from the NBAS are incorporated into the neurologic examination:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consolability − is easiest to assess in a crying infant. A number of techniques are used to try to calm the infant within 15 seconds. They include infant sucking on a pacifier or the examiner's finger, holding, rocking, placing a hand on the infant's belly, restraining one or both arms of the infant, soothing by voice, or a combination of a soothing voice and the examiner's face approaching the infant. Infants with brain injury are more difficult to console than a normal infant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Habituation − Habituation is a marker of cortical inhibitory function and measures the infant's ability to learn to diminish his/her response to repetitive stimuli. The use of repeating light or auditory stimuli are used to test for habituation. The shining of a soft light initially elicits a blinking response that diminishes in intensity over the first four to five trials, and afterwards ceases with subsequent trials. Similarly, auditory stimuli, such as hand claps, elicit a startle response to the first four or five stimuli, after which there is little to no response. The lack of habituation is compatible with cortical dysfunction, which is exemplified by the behavior of an infant with prenatal substance abuse exposure.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38"><span class="h1">INTERPRETATION AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The newborn neurologic examination has some limitations in its specificity and its ability to predict long-term outcome, in part due to a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The exam has limited utility in extremely preterm infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks) and those who are heavily sedated or receiving skeletal muscle paralytic agents for ventilator management. It is important to maintain a low threshold for obtaining a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) whenever a disturbance of the central nervous system is suspected. </p><p>Nevertheless, abnormal neurologic findings can be useful in guiding care and predicting outcome in the following manner:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>They can define the site and extent of injury, which guides the choice of further management decisions. As an example, the neurologic examination is an important component in making the diagnosis of encephalopathy and determining its severity. The severity of encephalopathy guides management decisions, including the use of therapeutic hypothermia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6216.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent neurologic dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. As an example, preterm infants with abnormal neurologic examination at the time of discharge from the newborn nursery compared with those with a normal examination have an increased risk of long-term motor impairment (eg, cerebral palsy) [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. The risk of cerebral palsy increases in infants with persistent hypotonia, weak cry, poor sucking, and decreased level of activity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4967.html" rel="external">"Long-term neurodevelopmental impairment in infants born preterm: Epidemiology and risk factors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6173.html" rel="external">"Cerebral palsy: Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent asymmetric findings often are associated with an underlying abnormality such as stroke, and should be further evaluated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Composites of neurologic findings appear to be better predictors of outcome than isolated neurologic findings. As an example, the Prechtl test, which is based upon classifying gross body movements, is reported to be a good predictor of neurologic outcome at two years of age [<a href="#rid4">4,30</a>]. In one study of preterm infants (gestational age [GA] &lt;30 weeks), the group with an abnormal Prechtl test was most likely to have abnormal Bayley Mental and Psychomotor Developmental Index scores at 24 months corrected age, followed by those with suspect results, and the normal group was least likely to have abnormal Bayley scores [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Prechtl system'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H39"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A comprehensive neurologic assessment should be performed in any neonate who is suspected to have a neurologic abnormality either based upon history (eg, perinatal asphyxia) or a finding during routine neonatal assessment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4984.html" rel="external">"Assessment of the newborn infant"</a>.)</p><p>Findings on the neurologic examination vary with gestational age (GA) and the infant's level of alertness. Serial examinations are sometimes necessary to reliably confirm a neurologic finding. (See <a class="local">'Overview'</a> above and <a class="local">'Level of alertness'</a> above.)</p><p>The newborn neurologic examination can be useful in guiding care and predicting outcome. However, there are limitations in its specificity and prognostic ability, partly due to the number of factors that affect the results of the examination. (See <a class="local">'Interpretation and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The neurologic examination includes the following components:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General assessment includes the vital signs, determination of the conceptional age (CA) of the infant and whether the infant's birth weight is appropriate for CA, a thorough examination of the head and spine, and identification of abnormalities suggestive of an underlying congenital disorder or perinatal event with associated neurologic problems. (See <a class="local">'General assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Motor function assessment is based upon evaluation of passive tone and posture, and active motor activity. Hypotonia is the most commonly identified motor abnormality, and is due to a variety of neurologic and muscular disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61045" href="/d/graphic/61045.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Motor function'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cranial nerve (CN) development varies with CA. In general, CNs I and XI are not tested in the neonates. The assessment of extraocular movements (CNs III, IV, VI) is based upon observation of spontaneous eye movements or the infant's response to the Doll's eyes test. Observation of the infant's sucking and swallowing assesses CNs V, VII, IX, X, and XII. Impaired gag reflex and decreased movement of the soft palate suggest dysfunction of CNs IX or X. Fasciculations over the tongue are seen with degeneration of the hypoglossal (CN XII) nucleus. (See <a class="local">'Cranial nerves'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reflex examination provides information on the integrity of the central and peripheral nervous system, and includes evaluation of deep tendon, superficial, and developmental (also referred to as primitive) reflexes. Developmental reflexes (eg, Moro, stepping, grasp, and asymmetrical tonic neck reflex) require coordination of multiple muscles and nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68117" href="/d/graphic/68117.html" rel="external">figure 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66214" href="/d/graphic/66214.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74355" href="/d/graphic/74355.html" rel="external">figure 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75985" href="/d/graphic/75985.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>).
