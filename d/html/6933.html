         Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a sensitive and specific serum marker for prostate tissue. Serial measurements are routinely obtained to detect early disease recurrence in males who have received definitive treatment for localized disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6928.html" rel="external">
          "Follow-up surveillance after definitive local treatment for prostate cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Monitoring PSA after definitive treatment of localized prostate cancer with either radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy leads to the identification of patients with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence. In this situation, increases in serum PSA are not accompanied by signs, symptoms, or radiographic evidence of locally recurrent or disseminated disease. Most of these individuals have testosterone levels that are &gt;50 ng/mL, and their prostate cancer is described as castration-sensitive, and potentially responsive to conventional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, GnRH antagonist, or orchiectomy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6950.html" rel="external">
          "Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification", section on 'Definition of biochemical progression'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with biochemical recurrence in whom there is a significant likelihood that disease is confined to the prostatic bed after surgery local salvage therapy may result in prolonged disease-free survival [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

        </p>
        <p>
         Systemic treatment may be indicated for some of these patients when clinical and radiographic features suggest that disseminated disease is highly probable, and hence, salvage local therapy is not indicated. ADT may also be indicated in the setting of a biochemical recurrence when comorbidity or advanced age precludes local salvage therapy. The timing of such therapy is debated.
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of ADT in the treatment of patients with a biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy will be reviewed here. The management of patients with castration-sensitive disseminated or locoregionally advanced recurrent prostate cancer is discussed separately, as is the treatment of castration-resistant disease in those without disseminated metastases.

         Monitoring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after treatment of localized prostate cancer can lead to the identification of patients with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence. In this situation, increases in serum PSA over the baseline after initial treatment are not accompanied by symptoms or signs of locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Although most patients who have a rising serum PSA following definitive therapy (radiation therapy [RT] or radical prostatectomy [RP]) will not have evidence of disseminated disease (which includes pelvic nodal disease), careful evaluation is required to rule out the possibility of distant metastases prior to attempts at local salvage therapy. Imaging should be performed to evaluate for metastasis, especially in cases with initial high-risk disease and/or short PSA doubling time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Notably, as newer more sensitive prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based tracers for integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography become more widely available stage-migration will occur whereby the number of patients with biochemical recurrence will shrink as a newly defined category of patients with PSA-recurrence with positive PET findings will be defined. This phenomenon will likely mean the prognosis for patients with a truly isolated biochemical recurrence will improve with time. For the purpose of this topic review distant metastasis will be defined as those that are detected using conventional, non-PET imaging. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">

         Many of these individuals are relatively young and otherwise healthy. If, after imaging evaluation, there is a significant likelihood that the clinically occult recurrent disease is confined to the prostate gland, local salvage therapy may result in prolonged disease-free survival. The following represents our general approach to integrating systemic therapy in these patients:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For patients with a confirmed rise in serum PSA following prior RT and no suspicion for pelvic nodal or distant metastases, biopsy of the prostate is indicated to confirm the presence of residual or recurrent prostate cancer.

          •
         </span>
         For patients with a positive biopsy who are candidates for local salvage therapy, treatment options include RP, cryotherapy, and brachytherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6932.html" rel="external">

          •
         </span>
         For patients who have received definitive RT but are not candidates for salvage therapy, systemic therapy may be indicated. However, in this situation, the possibility that the rising serum PSA is due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or retained normal prostate should be considered, and a three to six month period of surveillance or trial of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor should be considered prior to committing to systemic therapy.

         For patients who have had a RP and a confirmed serum PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL with no evidence of distant metastases, salvage RT, often combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), is the primary treatment option. However, systemic therapy (ADT alone or in combination with an antiandrogen) is an alternative for those who are not candidates for or refuse salvage RT. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6952.html" rel="external">

         Systemic therapy is also the primary therapeutic option for patients who have had local salvage therapy following their initial definitive treatment and who subsequently have an ongoing or recurrent isolated biochemical recurrence with noncastrate serum levels of testosterone (&gt;50 ng/dL).

         and ADT, given that these males have a higher chance of developing metastatic disease. In males with a higher risk for toxicity such as individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, seizure disorder, or have frailty ADT alone is an acceptable alternative. The use of enzalutamide alone may be an option for select patients who do not wish to receive ADT due to concerns of toxicity. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         We use ASCO guidelines, which define high-risk features as:

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">

         In males with no high-risk features present, surveillance is preferred. ADT therapy can cause significant side effects without a clear benefit in low-risk patients. However, in those patients that value potentially maximizing survival more than the potential impact on quality of life, ADT is an option after a detailed discussion about potential toxicity and benefit.

        <p>
         If systemic therapy is started for an isolated biochemical recurrence with a serum testosterone level &gt;50 ng/dL, we suggest conventional ADT monotherapy (a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist, GnRH antagonist, or orchiectomy) rather than complete androgen blockade, combined androgen blockade, antiandrogen monotherapy, or a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.

          enzalutamide
         </a>
         and ADT, particularly given that it reduces side effects. Select patients with low-risk features may opt for ADT instead of surveillance, particularly if they would accept toxicities in exchange for potentially extending survival. ADT includes options using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, GnRH antagonist, or orchiectomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale and efficacy of ADT for advanced disseminated prostate cancer, including the various forms of ADT, is presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6951.html" rel="external">
          "Initial systemic therapy for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic noncastrate (castration-sensitive) prostate cancer", section on 'Benefits and methods for androgen deprivation therapy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         No adequate data from randomized trials have compared the role of ADT with observation in patients with biochemical recurrence, and the applicability of data from individuals with more advanced disease is unclear. Nevertheless, ADT represents an effective form of therapy, and can reduce the likelihood of disease progression. The "PSA response" to ADT following biochemical recurrence may be useful as an intermediate end point for prognosis and to predict the time to prostate cancer death in patients with biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6950.html" rel="external">
          "Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification", section on 'Risk of metastases or death'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in patients with biochemical recurrence after first-line treatment, metastatic disease may not become evident for many years. ADT causes side effects that can significantly lower the quality of life. These adverse effects are particularly important in otherwise asymptomatic individuals whose only manifestation of disease is a rising serum PSA. The potential development of hot flashes, fatigue, loss of libido, decreased muscle mass, mild anemia, cognitive changes, and osteoporosis is a significant concern and needs to be considered in deciding when to initiate ADT. Furthermore, concerns about ADT-induced weight gain and an increased risk for diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, and metabolic syndrome add credence to the use of a risk-stratified approach. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6927.html" rel="external">
          "Side effects of androgen deprivation therapy"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Key questions concerning the use of ADT include whether treatment should be initiated as soon as a rising PSA is detected or can be delayed, and whether initial treatment with ADT should use monotherapy (eg, a GnRH agonist, GnRH antagonist, or orchiectomy), combined androgen blockade (CAB; a GnRH agonist or orchiectomy plus an antiandrogen), ADT in combination with chemotherapy or in combination with a second-generation androgen signaling inhibitor (such as

         Proponents of early treatment argue that this approach can delay disease progression and may prolong survival. Others contend that treatment is best deferred until clinical metastases or symptoms develop since there is no consistent evidence for a significant survival benefit with ADT in this setting, metastatic disease may not become evident for many years [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         IAD attempts to minimize the adverse effects of medical castration by withdrawing treatment in patients who have responded to ADT and then reinstituting ADT when there is evidence of recurrent or progressive disease. The biologic rationale is twofold. First, prolonged ADT theoretically may facilitate progression from androgen dependence to androgen independence. In addition, many of the acute and chronic side effects of ADT are due to castrate levels of testosterone. Off-therapy periods of time may be associated with decreases in these side effects, thereby improving quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Males managed with IAD can be expected to be off therapy approximately 35 to 50 percent of the time. Time off treatment in the first cycle ranges from 6 to 15 months and may be longer for patients with less advanced disease, such as PSA-only progression with long PSA doubling time, compared with those with overt metastatic disease. The off-treatment period is generally associated with an improvement in the sense of wellbeing, and recovery of libido and potency in those who report normal or near-normal sexual function before the start of IAD.

         Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses have addressed the benefit of IAD in patients with an biochemical recurrence. Although intermittent approaches are associated with better physical functioning and quality of life, questions remain as to whether or not overall survival is adversely impacted.

         In an early seminal international trial, 1386 males with a rising PSA following RT were randomly assigned to either IAD or continuous ADT [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Patients assigned to IAD were treated for eight months; treatment was then restarted when the serum PSA reached &gt;10 ng/mL off treatment. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. The statistical design of the trial was based upon the demonstration of noninferiority, with noninferiority defined by a true difference in overall survival of less than 8 percentage points, which corresponded to an HR &lt;1.25.

         At a median follow-up of 6.9 years, overall survival with IAD met the study criterion for noninferiority compared with continuous ADT (median 8.8 versus 9.1 years, HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86-1.21). Notably, individuals treated with IAD had more disease- or treatment-related deaths but fewer deaths unrelated to prostate cancer compared with continuous ADT (120 versus 94 and 148 versus 162 deaths, respectively).

         </span>
         Analyses of quality of life suggested that there were modest benefits with IAD, but the results may have been limited by the timing of the quality of life assessments. Differences in functional domain did not show a statistically significant benefit for IAD. Specific symptoms that did show a statistically significant benefit included hot flashes, desire for sexual activity, and urinary symptoms. Among the patients treated with IAD, serum testosterone levels returned to pretreatment levels in only 35 percent within two years after initial cycle of treatment, and only 29 percent of individuals who were potent at baseline had a return of potency.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         These results suggest that there is a potential benefit for IAD compared with continuous ADT in terms of quality of life. Furthermore, overall survival did not appear to be inferior. However, only 214 out of 1386 patients (15 percent) had died when the results of the trial were analyzed.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         It has been argued that all of the randomized trials addressing the benefit of intermittent as compared with continuous ADT, including this one, observed better outcomes in terms of overall and progression-free survival than were assumed at time of study design, translating into prespecified noninferiority margins or hazard ratios that reflected larger absolute differences in these survival outcomes than were initially considered appropriate [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. These wide noninferiority margins include clinically important survival differences, not likely to be considered comparable by clinicians and patients.

         Additional information of the benefit of IAD comes from a meta-analysis that found noninferiority for IAD compared with continuous ADT for prostate cancer of any stage (HR for overall survival 1.02, 95% CI 0.87-1.19; HR for cancer-specific survival 1.02, 95% CI 0.87-1.19; HR for progression-free survival 0.94, 95% CI 0.84-1.05) although the studies all had an unclear or high risk of bias [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Notably, there was a minimal difference in patients’ self-reported quality of life between the two interventions, but most trials observed an improvement in physical and sexual functioning with IAD.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         This conclusion is further supported by five other meta-analyses that tested whether IAD was in fact superior to continuous ADT, and all of which found no difference in overall survival between IAD and continuous ADT for both the combined population of males with non-metastatic and metastatic disease, but also separately for the non-metastatic and metastatic disease populations [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-21
         </a>
         ]. Notably, however, one of these did find a significantly higher risk of death from cancer in the IAD group (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.31) based on somewhat weak data, but a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.67-0.94) [

         ADT can be accomplished by preventing androgen production (orchiectomy, GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists) or by androgen receptor blockade with antiandrogens; these methods can be used either as monotherapy or in combination.

         The combination of a GnRH agonist or orchiectomy plus an antiandrogen is commonly referred to as CAB since it removes the influence of both testicular and adrenal androgens. For males initiating ADT for an isolated biochemical recurrence with low-risk features, we suggested ADT monotherapy rather than complete androgen blockade. However, for those with high-risk features, we suggest CAB. (See

         There are no randomized trials comparing GnRH agonists or orchiectomy alone versus CAB using a first-generation antiandrogen in males with a PSA-only recurrence.

        </p>
        <p>
         The 5-alpha reductase inhibitors block the intraprostatic conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen acting on the prostate, while the nonsteroidal antiandrogens block the cytoplasmic DHT receptor. Since testosterone conversion is blocked selectively within the prostate, serum testosterone levels are maintained during treatment. As a result, most individuals retain their pretreatment libido, potency, muscle mass, and erythropoietic capacity.

Notably, standard bone scans and computed tomography, and not more sensitive imaging tests (such as fluciclovine F-18 positron emission tomography [PET] or 68-gallium-PSMA [prostate-specific membrane antigen] PET), were used to define "non-metastatic" in these trials. The results of these trials are discussed separately. (See

         Monitoring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after treatment of localized prostate cancer can lead to the identification of individuals with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence, in which increases in serum PSA over expected remission values are not accompanied by symptoms or signs of locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Although most patients will not have evidence of disseminated disease, imaging evaluation is required to rule out the possibility of distant metastases prior to salvage therapy, especially in cases with initial high-risk disease and/or short PSA doubling time. (See
         <a class="local">

         Systemic therapy is the primary therapeutic option for patients who have had local salvage therapy following initial definitive treatment and who subsequently have an ongoing or recurrent isolated biochemical recurrence with noncastrate serum levels of testosterone (&gt;50 ng/dL). Systemic therapy may also be indicated when comorbidity or advanced age precludes aggressive local salvage therapy.

          For castrate-sensitive disease
         </strong>
         – In patients with castrate-sensitive isolated biochemical recurrence in whom systemic therapy is indicated, our approach is as follows:

         For most patients with any high-risk feature for early metastases, we suggest early rather than deferred systemic therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). High-risk features are: a PSA doubling time &lt;12 months or pathologic Gleason score 8 to 10 after radical prostatectomy, or interval to biochemical recurrence &lt;18 months, or a clinical Gleason score 8 to 10 after radiation therapy. There is no consensus on what is "early" initiation of ADT, but a practical target is a PSA &lt;5 to 10 ng/mL. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When to initiate ADT-based therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         For individuals who lack a high-risk feature, we delay systemic therapy, with careful informed consent and periodic imaging and monitoring of PSA to assess for progressing disease (ie, active surveillance).

         For choice of systemic therapy in patients with high-risk disease, we suggest complete androgen blockade using ADT and

         However ADT alone is a reasonable alternative for those who are unlikely to tolerate the toxicities of the combination. For patients who are starting ADT alone for an isolated biochemical recurrence, intermittent rather than continuous ADT is a reasonable option. For individuals who place a greater value on potentially maximizing overall survival, and a lesser value on avoiding/minimizing the side effects of ADT, continuous treatment might be preferred. (See
