         Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated (also called immediate) allergies account for the majority of clinically significant environmental, food, and medication allergies. Immediate reactions develop within a few minutes to approximately two hours after exposure. Skin testing is an important element in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy.

        <p>
         This topic review will discuss general principles of skin testing used in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy, including indications, contraindications, factors influencing results, techniques, and accuracy. The two major methods of skin testing used, the
         <strong>
          prick/puncture
         </strong>
         technique and the
         <strong>
          intradermal
         </strong>
         technique, are described. The use of skin testing to diagnose specific disorders is presented in the appropriate topic reviews. (See

         Allergy testing to demonstrate allergen-specific IgE fulfills the second component and is an important element in the evaluation of allergic disease. However, a positive skin test, by itself, is
         <strong>
          not sufficient
         </strong>
         to make a diagnosis. Positive skin tests must be supported by an appropriate clinical history of reactivity and, in some cases, allergen challenge, to confirm that the suspected allergen causes symptoms.

         Skin testing and other diagnostic procedures in the field of allergy (eg, challenges) should be performed by specialists trained in the methods and interpretation of the test results. Any procedure that involves the deliberate exposure of a patient to a substance that may cause significant harm should be undertaken by someone with expertise in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. In addition, because each type of allergy has unique characteristics and implications for the patient's health, an allergy expert can be an invaluable source of information for both the patient and the primary provider.

         Skin testing is the most rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective testing modality for the detection of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, immediate allergic disease. The procedure lasts less than an hour with minimal patient discomfort. There are several published practice parameters for allergen skin testing [

         ]. The material in this topic is consistent with, although not identical to, these publications.

         For an individual patient, the relative size of positive reactions gives some indication of the patient's sensitivity to specific allergens, although the sizes of positive reactions vary significantly among individuals. (See

         Patients can see the reactions, and this often helps them understand that they are/are not allergic to a given substance. In addition, watching the swelling and erythema develop in the skin helps patients understand what happens elsewhere in the body in response to allergen exposure.

         Solutions for skin testing can be made from a wide variety of allergenic inhalants, foods, and medications, whereas commercial in vitro tests are available for a more limited number of allergens. Thus, skin testing is often useful for evaluating possible allergies to unusual allergens.

         </span>
         Skin testing is a bioassay that detects the presence of allergen-specific IgE on a patient's mast cells. A positive reaction implies that mast cells within other target organs (ie, eyes, nose, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract) would also react upon exposure to that allergen.
        </p>
        <p>
         When allergen is introduced into the skin of a patient during skin testing, it comes into contact with cutaneous mast cells. Binding of the allergen occurs if the patient's mast cells are coated with IgE recognizing that specific allergen. If both IgE and allergen are present in sufficient quantities, then adjacent IgE molecules directed against the allergen may be crosslinked on the cell surface and initiate intracellular signaling. Biologically standardized allergen extracts contain the allergen at low concentrations, and positive results are dependent upon the extremely high affinity of IgE-allergen interactions. The issues surrounding skin testing with nonstandardized extracts of fresh foods are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Quality of the extract'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         These events lead to mast cell activation, release of the contents of intracellular granules (degranulation), and the de novo generation of inflammatory mediators. Degranulation releases preformed vasoactive mediators and enzymes, such as histamine, tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase. Histamine is the major mediator of the wheal and flare response, but other mediators (eg, prostaglandin D2) are also involved, as the size of the wheal does not correlate directly with the concentrations of histamine released [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical result of these cellular events is a positive skin test or a transient "wheal-and-flare" reaction. This reaction consists of a localized central area of superficial skin edema (wheal) surrounded by erythema (flare). This pruritic reaction represents the immediate phase of the allergic reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Late-phase reactions (LPRs) may develop at skin test sites in some individuals. These consist of deep tissue swelling, warmth, pruritus, and erythema beginning one to two hours after testing and resolving in 24 to 48 hours [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. LPRs are mast cell mediated and IgE dependent, although they do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         predict symptoms on exposure and are not used in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy [

         A person with demonstrable IgE to a specific allergen is said to be "sensitized" to that allergen. Both skin testing and in vitro testing are used to demonstrate IgE sensitization. However, a sensitized person is considered "allergic" to an allergen only if they react with representative symptoms when exposed to it.
        </p>
        <p>
         This distinction is made because not all sensitized patients will develop actual symptoms on exposure:

         With some food skin tests, for example, only about 50 percent of positive tests are true positives. Thus, food challenge procedures are often necessary to clarify a patient's allergic status.
        </p>
        <p>

         By comparison, the proportion of individuals with positive pollen skin tests who react to inhalation of that pollen is much higher. Therefore, a positive skin test and a history of symptoms during the appropriate season are sufficient to make the diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, the confirmation of reactivity is crucial to making an accurate diagnosis and this is more important for certain types of allergy (eg, food) than for others. The relationship between sensitization and clinical allergy is reviewed in more detail separately. (See

         A focused approach is most appropriate for patients whose history and/or physical examination strongly indicates the identity of the specific offending allergen(s). As an example, a patient who developed urticaria and wheezing while taking penicillin would be evaluated with tests for IgE specific to penicillin and its immediate derivatives.

         H1 antihistamines can suppress skin reactivity for one to seven days, depending upon the specific drug. First-generation nonselective antihistamines (eg,

          10-12

         ]. A general approach is to discontinue all antihistamines for one week prior to testing.
         <strong>
          It is important to recognize that if a patient has not withheld antihistamines for the full recommended time, interference can still be present even though the histamine reaction is positive.
         </strong>
         In some cases, residual antihistamines will reduce the histamine control response but completely negate the response to allergens [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-12
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         In patients who are not at an increased risk for a systemic reaction, the decision to discontinue these medications prior to skin testing depends upon the patient's dose and the condition for which they are receiving the beta blocker or ACE inhibitor. Such decisions should be made on an individual patient basis. The impact of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors on the treatment of anaphylaxis is discussed elsewhere. (See

         The results of skin testing can be influenced by the potency and quality of allergenic extracts, testing devices, and techniques. (See

         The potency and quality of the allergen extract used for testing can influence the results of skin testing. In most cases, standardized extracts are preferred when available. The major inhalant allergens (eg, grasses, dust mites, ragweed) are well characterized and some are standardized in potency units (eg, grasses, dust mites, ragweed).
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, most commercially-available food extracts are not standardized. However, extracts of milk, eggs, peanuts, soy, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts are reliable. In contrast, commercial extracts of fruits and vegetables are sometimes inadequate because the responsible allergen may be labile and altered during processing. Thus, in the event of a negative skin test for these foods, or when there is suspicion that the allergenicity of the food depends on its preparation (raw versus cooked), the fresh food should be used for skin testing using the "prick-by-prick" method. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prick-by-prick testing with fresh food'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Conversely, false-positive results can arise from naturally-occurring histamine and other vasoactive amines in some allergen extracts (ie, insect venoms, molds, foods) as extracts produced in the United States are not dialyzed to remove histamine, which may occur as a natural contaminant, or from cross-reactivity with clinically-irrelevant proteins. An example of the latter phenomenon can occur in foods containing the profilin protein Bet v 2, which can cause positive skin tests to foods in birch-allergic patients without symptoms of food allergy [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the testing of some foods, false positives can occur from irritating properties of the drug in question. As an example, skin testing for spice allergy is usually not informative, as spices can yield false positives due to the many chemicals contained in them. However, in vitro testing for IgE specific to that spice is sometimes available. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16707.html" rel="external">
          "Testing and challenge procedures to evaluate allergic and asthmatic reactions to food additives", section on 'Skin prick testing'

        </p>
        <p>
         Certain drugs activate mast cells directly rather than through drug-specific IgE, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9291" href="/z/d/drug information/9291.html" rel="external">
          codeine
         </a>
         and pholcodine. Skin testing to these drugs is usually avoided in favor of carefully performed challenge procedures [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If a false positive result is suspected, repeating the test in one or more volunteers to assure that the test is negative in others is sometimes required. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2079.html" rel="external">

         Finally, allergen extracts for use in skin testing are sometimes in low supply and are labor intensive to generate. In the future, recombinant allergen extracts may be developed for diagnostic purposes [

         The testing device used can influence the results and the practitioner should consider the strengths and weaknesses of different devices when deciding which method to use [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45-48

         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Careful consideration of the device used is of particular importance in research settings. As an example, multiheaded devices (those that allow for application of several antigens simultaneously) produce more false negatives than single-headed devices, and the inner heads may produce weaker responses than the heads on the corners of the devices. However, multiheaded devices can be very useful when testing children by allowing rapid application of multiple antigens [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,49-51

         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. The allergens relevant to human-allergic disease are usually either glycoproteins and lipoproteins from other living organisms, or in the case of some drug and occupational allergens, a combination of small chemical moieties conjugated (or "haptenated") to serum proteins. Hundreds of clinically-significant allergens have been identified from tree, grass, and weed pollens, molds, dust mites, foods, parasites, animal danders, insect venoms, drugs, occupational chemicals, and other biologic materials [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. At this time, the commercially-prepared allergens used in clinical practice are obtained almost exclusively from natural sources. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/363.html" rel="external">
          "Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling"

        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, the more important allergenic proteins from a given substance have been identified, cloned, sequenced, and produced through recombinant technology. However, recombinant allergens do not necessarily reproduce the clinical response observed to natural allergens. Allergens from natural sources are heterogeneous. Individual allergic patients can be sensitive to different allergens from the same source, and can even respond differently to isoallergens that are identical except for minor differences in primary amino acid composition or substituted side chains [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

Recombinant allergens are used for both testing and treatment in Europe, although they are still limited to research applications in the United States. (See

         The prick/puncture or epicutaneous method of skin testing involves application of droplets of 1:10 or 1:20 weight/volume allergen extract solutions on the volar surface of the forearm or upper back, after the skin has been cleaned with a 70 percent alcohol solution. Standardized allergenic extracts labeled by potency units, such as bioequivalent allergy units (BAU) should be used at the recommended strength per package insert. Each droplet contains a single allergen extract, although for screening purposes, mixes of closely-related allergens (eg, four tree pollens) are sometimes used. One of a number of commercially-available test devices are then used to prick through the droplets of allergen. Tests should be placed at least 2 centimeters apart to avoid overlapping reactions [

         Positive results are recorded by measuring the greatest diameter of both the wheal and the erythema (separate measurements for each) in millimeters, at 10 minutes for the histamine control, and at 15 to 20 minutes for the allergen extracts. For research purposes, a more precise measurement is usually used, in which the longest wheal diameter (D) and the diameter perpendicular to D (d) are measured.

This is often done to evaluate allergies to fruits, many of which occur only if the fruit is eaten in the raw form. To perform this, the food and the patient's skin are both cleaned, and the test device is used to prick first the food and then the patient's skin. If a positive test is obtained using this method, the test should be repeated on a nonallergic individual, to assure that the result is not a false-positive irritant response. (See

         Prick/puncture testing is sensitive although not very specific. Overall positive predictive accuracy is less than 50 percent if all types of allergens are considered together. However, the exact sensitivity and specificity of skin prick testing are highly dependent on the allergens used as well as the different variables inherent in this bioassay (see
         <a class="local">
          'Factors affecting results'
         </a>

         A positive skin test to a particular allergen, taken alone, only indicates the presence of IgE specific to that allergen. It still must be demonstrated that the patient develops symptoms upon exposure to the allergen. A positive skin test in the absence of a relevant clinical history may be indicative of subclinical sensitization (ie, may be a true positive) that may eventually become clinically apparent, or it may be a false-positive reaction. It may also occur in patients who, due to their lifestyles, are less exposed to allergens that they are sensitized to.

          55

Testing was performed in 50 patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis (group 1), 50 without these conditions but with a positive immediate family history of the disorders (group 2), and 100 subjects without a personal or family history of asthma or allergic rhinitis (group 3). At least one positive test reaction (as defined by a mean wheal diameter of greater than or equal to 3 mm) was observed in 90, 46, and 29 percent of those in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with accuracy based in part on the allergen. As an example, a positive reaction to the cat allergen was associated with a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 90 percent, when compared with the clinical history.

         The technique of end-point dilution is a variant of intradermal testing that is used to identify the concentration of an extract that produces a reaction of a defined size. It is used in research settings but is impractical for clinical use. The more sensitive an individual is to a given extract, the lower the concentration required to produce a reaction of a given size. End-point dilution is performed by injecting a series of dilutions of an extract into a patient's skin, until a specific diameter wheal or flare is obtained. Uses include:

         For inhalant allergens, intradermal testing has a higher rate of false positives compared with prick/puncture testing. A positive intradermal test, in the context of negative skin prick test, has a low-positive predictive value for the presence of symptoms upon allergen exposure. False positives may be related to naturally-occurring histamine, endotoxins, and other skin irritants in inhalant extracts [

         Intradermal testing is the preferred method for the diagnosis of immediate allergies to drugs and stinging insect venoms because it is more sensitive than prick/puncture. Prick/puncture testing is performed first to detect the uncommon, extremely sensitive patient who is at risk for a systemic reaction with intradermal testing. If negative, this is followed by intradermal skin testing.

         Although it is the preferred method of skin testing for drug allergy, falsely negative results can occur for reasons that have not been fully demonstrated. Potential mechanisms include the possibility that the drug only acts as an allergy when the native drug or its breakdown products are complexed with serum proteins (such as with beta-lactam allergy) or the amount of specific IgE present is too low.

          The role of skin testing in diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The three components in the diagnosis of an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy are identification of the allergen, demonstration of IgE specific to that allergen, and confirmation that symptoms occur when the patient is exposed to the allergen. Skin testing is a diagnostic tool used in the second component. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role in diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Sensitization versus clinical allergy
         </strong>
         – A positive skin test, in isolation, is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of allergy, as it must also be demonstrated that the patient develops symptoms on exposure to that allergen. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sensitization versus clinical allergy'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Referral and mechanism
         </strong>
         – Skin testing should be performed by an allergy expert, as there is a small but definite risk of inducing an allergic reaction. Skin testing is a bioassay that detects the presence of allergen-specific IgE on the surface of a patient's cutaneous mast cells. Allergen is pricked into the skin and if allergen-specific IgE is present on the patient's mast cells, the cells are activated and produce localized pruritus, swelling, and erythema. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of skin testing'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Indications
         </strong>
         – The allergic diseases for which skin testing is useful in diagnosis include allergic asthma, rhinitis and conjunctivitis, food allergy, some medication allergies, some venom allergies, and depending on the availability of testing reagents, latex allergy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications'

         <strong>
          Contraindications
         </strong>
         – Skin testing is contraindicated in patients who are at high risk for an anaphylactic reaction to testing, have experienced a recent anaphylactic event, are taking medications that may interfere with the treatment of anaphylaxis, or have certain skin conditions. Such patients should undergo in vitro allergy testing instead. (See
         <a class="local">

         above.)

         <strong>
          Factors affecting results
         </strong>
         – The results of skin testing are influenced by medications, physiologic characteristics of the patient, the device used, and the allergen extract used. Antihistamines must be discontinued prior to testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Factors affecting results'

         <strong>
          Allergen preparation
         </strong>
         – The allergens relevant to human disease are mostly proteins from other living organisms that are able to trigger the formation of IgE in genetically-susceptible individuals. Allergens for testing are obtained from natural sources and are heterogeneous. Efforts are underway to standardize their production around the world. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Allergen preparation'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Prick/puncture versus intradermal technique
         </strong>
         – There are two commonly used methods of skin testing for IgE-mediated disorders: prick/puncture and intradermal. Prick/puncture is performed first and is sensitive but not very specific. Intradermal testing is more sensitive, although false positives are common and it carries a higher risk of inducing an allergic reaction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Skin testing methods'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Prick/puncture skin testing has low specificity if all allergens are considered together. However, sensitivity and specificity are both excellent with standardized, high potency extracts, such as pollen extracts. In addition, the negative-predictive value of skin prick testing with certain allergens (eg, inhalants and foods) is very high and skin testing can exclude allergy with relative certainty. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prick/puncture method'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Intradermal tests are usually performed following
         <strong>
          negative
         </strong>
         prick/puncture tests and are approximately 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive. Intradermal testing is not performed in the diagnosis of food or latex allergy, due to an unacceptably high rate of both false positives and systemic reactions to testing. In contrast, intradermal testing is important in the diagnosis of drug and insect venom allergies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intradermal method'
