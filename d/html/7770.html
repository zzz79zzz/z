         It is estimated that up to 84 percent of all adults have low back pain at some time in their lives, and it is one of the more common reasons for a primary care visit [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Rapid improvement in pain and disability and return to work are the norm within the first month [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. While the long-term outcome of low back pain is generally favorable and episodes are self-limited for most people, symptoms may persist beyond 12 weeks for some, and even among those no longer seeking care [

         Exercise therapy is safe, readily available, helps alleviate pain symptoms, and improves function in patients with low back pain. There are a wide range of exercise and other movement-based therapies commonly used in patients with subacute and chronic low back pain, and most have similar efficacy. Such exercise programs include motor control exercise (also known as specific stabilization exercise), core strengthening (eg, abdominal and trunk extensor), flexion/extension movements, directional preference (eg, McKenzie exercises), general physical fitness, aerobic exercise, Pilates, exercise programs with a mind-body component (eg, yoga and Tai Chi), and functional restoration programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most exercise therapies appear to be similarly effective, and the decision on which type of exercise to recommend should be based upon practical considerations, including local availability, patient preferences and abilities, possible insurance coverage issues, and previous history of success (or lack of success) with a particular exercise program.

         For some patients, an episode of low back pain may last beyond four weeks. The period from 4 to 12 weeks represents a transition period, in which improvement in pain and function typically is less rapid than in the acute phase, and some patients may develop persistent (chronic) pain. In this period of subacute low back pain, the goals of treatment are to work towards resolution of symptoms if possible, to identify those at higher risk for developing chronic pain, and to intervene as early as possible in such patients. For those patients whose symptoms persist beyond three months, however, the goal of treatment moves from "curing" to controlling pain, maintaining function, maximizing coping, and preventing disability.

         The use of other treatments in addition to self-care advice and exercise therapies depends upon the patients’ risk factors for the development of chronic pain and chronic low back pain-related disability.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are known factors associated with development of chronic low back pain and low back pain-related disability, including preexisting psychological conditions, somatization, maladaptive pain coping behaviors (eg, fear avoidance or catastrophizing), high level of functional impairment, the presence of other types of chronic pain, job dissatisfaction or stress, and dispute over compensation issues [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Other risk factors may include obesity, smoking, and the receipt of medical care inconsistent with low back pain management guidelines [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Patients with risk factors for the development of chronic low back pain may benefit from different treatment approaches earlier in their presentation. A formal risk-stratified care approach may help clinicians determine which patients with low back pain are at risk for chronicity [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ], and structured evaluation tools are available to assist in this evaluation [

         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. It has been validated as a predictive tool and, in a randomized trial in the United Kingdom, a risk-stratified approach using STarT Back was more effective than usual care in managing patients with low back pain of varying duration [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. However, in a trial using an adapted STarT Back approach in the United States, there was no improvement in patient outcomes, although the results are limited by trial methodology [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ]. These mixed results may reflect the challenges of implementing the STarT Back approach in different treatment settings.

         By risk stratifying patients, clinicians may be able to refer those at higher risk for additional interventions earlier while avoiding overtreatment in patients who have a high likelihood of recovery (for whom advice on self-care interventions and exercise may be sufficient). (See

         In addition to self-care advice and exercise, all patients with subacute low back pain who are at higher risk of developing chronic pain should be referred for interventions that address psychosocial contributors to pain. Such therapies include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or mind-body interventions including mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR], biofeedback, and progressive relaxation. These interventions can be prescribed individually, combined with supervised exercise programs, or coordinated through a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. (See

         In addition to providing self-care advice, referring for exercise therapies, and CBT or MBSR, we refer some patients with subacute low back pain (those with more severe symptoms and risk factors for chronicity including maladaptive behaviors and functional impairment) for short-term interventions such as spinal manipulation, acupuncture, or massage. These patients may benefit from "passive" treatments which may provide short-term symptomatic improvement, allowing them to participate in active therapies.
        </p>

         Many of the studies evaluating the use of these treatments were performed in either patients with chronic low back pain, or in mixed (combined subacute and chronic) back pain patient populations.

         Spinal manipulation may have beneficial short-term benefits in the management of subacute and chronic low back pain. It is a form of manual therapy that involves the movement of a joint beyond its usual end range of motion, but not past its anatomic range of motion. Spinal manipulation is most commonly associated with chiropractic providers, but is also performed by other providers, including osteopathic clinicians and physical therapists. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7776.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         A 2011 meta-analysis including 26 randomized trials of 6000 patients with chronic low back pain compared spinal manipulation with multiple interventions including general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy, exercises, back school, massage, ultrasound, transcutaneous muscle stimulation, and pain clinic care [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Spinal manipulation had small short-term effects on pain reduction and improved functional status compared with the other interventions. Subsequent randomized trials support these findings of short-term benefits of spinal manipulation in patients with subacute and chronic low back pain [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-26
         </a>

         Clinical trials and meta-analyses have generally found acupuncture (an intervention consisting of the insertion of needles at specific predetermined acupuncture points) is more effective than usual care for low back pain, but may not be more effective than sham acupuncture (insertion of needles at nonacupuncture points, or applying needles to acupuncture points but not actually inserting them) [

         In a meta-analysis of 33 clinical trials involving 8270 participants with chronic nonspecific low back pain, pain relief and functional outcomes were similar in patients treated with real and sham acupuncture procedures [

However, acupuncture was more effective for immediate pain relief when compared with no treatment (mean difference on the visual analog scale [range 0 to 100; 0 = no pain, 100 = worst pain], 20 points lower in the acupuncture group, 95% CI 16-24; four trials, 366 participants). In addition, back-specific functional status was higher in the acupuncture group (mean difference in the Hannover Function Ability Questionnaire [range 0 to 100; 0 = disabled, 100 = full function] 12 points lower in the acupuncture group, 95% CI 7-16; five trials, 2960 participants).

         There is limited evidence to support the long-term efficacy of massage therapy in the treatment of chronic low back pain, although interpretation and comparison of studies is hampered by differences in the comparator interventions, including types of massage, duration, and frequency of massage sessions.

         Patients should be encouraged to take the lowest effective dose of an NSAID for the shortest period of time. High-quality data are limited on optimal NSAID dosing strategies for the management of subacute low back pain, but one reasonable approach is to have the patient take a standing dose for one to two weeks, then decrease the dose and dosing frequency as tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Systematic reviews of randomized trials found that, compared with placebo, NSAIDs are slightly more effective for both pain relief and improvement in function in mixed back pain (acute and chronic) populations [

          31-33

        </p>
        <p>
         NSAIDs are associated with well-known gastrointestinal and renal side effects. In addition, exposure to NSAIDS is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, which may be related to the degree of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition [

         When a skeletal muscle relaxant is needed, we use the lowest effective dose and dosing frequency.

Patients who may be more sensitive to the sedating effects (eg, older patients, and those with organ impairment or those receiving potentially interacting medications) may better tolerate a reduced starting dose, less frequent administration, and a more gradual titration. All patients should be advised of their potential to cause drowsiness.

         Those patients with chronic low back pain and more severe, persistent, disabling symptoms and significant functional impairment require more intensive management strategies. For such patients, the goal of care is to manage pain, increase function, and maximize coping skills. Utilizing a combination of exercise therapies, psychological and/or mind-body interventions, pharmacologic therapy, and other treatments is often required to achieve this goal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Such patients may benefit from participation in a supervised (rather than independent) exercise program; the support offered by such a program may provide structure and reassurance and ultimately allow the patient to progress to performing more independent exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Maintaining an emphasis on active therapy is consistent with a biopsychosocial approach to pain, which engages patients in their care, more directly aiming to improve function, not just reducing pain. Movement-based interventions with a mind-body component, including Tai-chi and yoga, are particularly well suited for patients with low back pain and functional limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Exercise and movement-based therapies can be combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mind-body interventions (mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR], biofeedback, and progressive relaxation).

         CBT and mind-body therapy treatment options are not widely available to all patients, and not all patients are amenable to participating in these therapies.

CBT is a goal-oriented, problem-solving psychotherapeutic approach where negative thinking patterns and coping behaviors are addressed, and it is widely used in the management of a variety of chronic pain syndromes.

         CBT improves both pain and disability in patients with low back pain. In a systematic review and meta-analysis including 23 studies and 3,300 patients with subacute and chronic low back pain, CBT was superior to waitlist control, usual care, and guideline-based active treatment for improvement in both short- and long-term pain and a reduction in disability [

         MBSR is a mind-body relaxation technique designed to enhance a person's ability to relax, cope with stress, and help manage pain. We also refer to MBSR programs, where available, as adjunctive treatment for higher-risk patients with disabling chronic low back pain. (See

         For patients with chronic low back pain and significant functional impairment in whom CBT or MBSR is inadequate in managing pain and improving function, we refer to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program if available. Insurance coverage for multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs is variable, however, and we usually only refer patients to these programs if non-multidisciplinary rehabilitation therapies have been unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Multidisciplinary, or interdisciplinary, rehabilitation combines (at a minimum) an exercise and a behavioral intervention component, provided by different health care professionals, and can be effective in the management of patients with higher-risk subacute low back pain and significant chronic low back pain. Intensity and content of interdisciplinary therapy vary widely, but the programs generally combine graded exercise therapy with a psychosocial approach, often involving a psychologist.
        </p>
        <p>
         Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs are usually coordinated by pain clinics or rehabilitation centers and may not be widely available in many communities. It is uncertain whether providing the components of multidisciplinary rehabilitation outside of a formal program is as effective as administering them through a coordinated program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Multidisciplinary therapy focuses on functional improvement (“functional restoration”) and may emphasize occupational aspects of rehabilitation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7774.html" rel="external">
          "Exercise-based therapy for low back pain", section on 'Choice of exercise: All programs are beneficial'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients are more likely to benefit from multidisciplinary rehabilitation if they are highly motivated, as the regimens can be time consuming (eg, &gt;20 hours per week). We advise referring clinicians be familiar with outcomes for specific programs, given the cost and heterogeneity of quality among programs [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a systematic review of 41 trials, multidisciplinary rehabilitation that combined a physical component with a psychological component and/or a social/work-targeted component was associated with slightly larger improvements in pain and function than usual care or non-multidisciplinary physical treatments (eg, exercise therapy, physical modalities, manual therapy, education) [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Differences were approximately 0.5 points on a 0 to 10 point pain scale and 1.5 points on the Roland Morris functional scale (both considered small differences)  (

          table 2

         ). Multidisciplinary treatment also increased the likelihood of return to work compared with non-multidisciplinary physical treatments alone (odds ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.39-2.53). There was no clear effect of intervention intensity (frequency and duration of therapies) on effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation.

         Although nonpharmacologic therapy is preferred over pharmacologic therapy for the management of chronic low back pain, they are commonly used together in clinical practice. The goal of medications is to provide symptomatic relief of pain while allowing the patient to participate in active therapies (exercise and/or psychological treatments), encouraging increased function and improved coping.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with persistent, disabling chronic low back pain and functional impairment, we often use pharmacologic therapy as adjunctive treatment concurrently with exercise and psychological therapies or mind-body interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with significant chronic low back pain who need adjunctive medication for symptom management, the supporting data on the duration of medication treatment are limited. Thus, limiting the duration of use for most medications is ideal but not always possible.

         If NSAIDs are effective in controlling symptoms, we continue them without adding additional pharmacologic therapy. We use the lowest effective dose and frequency, favoring an "as needed" over a "standing" dosing schedule, and attempt to taper and ultimately discontinue these drugs if possible. NSAIDs are associated with side effects (eg, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular), and risk factors for complications should be assessed before recommending. (See

         Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of opioid use in patients with chronic low back pain identified few high-quality and no long-term trials [

          59,61-64
         </a>
         ]. In the available trials, opioids produced only small, short-term improvements in pain and function when compared with placebo and had no benefit compared with NSAIDs or antidepressants. A long-term randomized trial compared stepped therapy with opioids versus nonopioid medications in 240 Veterans Affairs patients with moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. At one year, there was no difference in pain-related function, while pain intensity was slightly better in nonopioid-treated patients. In addition, patients treated with opioids experienced more negative side effects. It should be noted that in patients assigned to stepped therapy with nonopioid medications, opioids were permitted at later steps, but the doses were very low.

        <p>
         Studies of the use of opioids for chronic and subacute low back pain rarely quantify the risk of important harms, such as abuse or addiction, and have typically excluded patients at higher risk for these types of adverse events. In one systematic review, aberrant drug-taking behaviors were found in up to 24 percent of patients receiving opioids for low back pain, but most studies had important methodologic shortcomings, including poorly described or validated methods for identifying such behaviors [

         Opioid pain medications are frequently prescribed for chronic low back pain, which is inconsistent with evidence-based care. The percentage of patients with visits for low back symptoms who were prescribed opioid pain medications in the United States increased between 2000 and 2010 (from 19 to 29 percent), while the percentage of those prescribed NSAIDs and

          acetaminophen

         declined (from 37 to 29 percent). The Back Pain Survey, using data collected between 2009 and 2010 from adults with self-reported chronic low back pain, revealed that almost 20 percent had used a prescription opioid pain medication within the past 30 days [

         Intensive education may be beneficial in subacute low back pain. However, data are lacking to support the efficacy of intensive education as a sole intervention in the management of chronic low back pain, rather than as an adjunct to other approaches such as exercise. In a systematic review of educational interventions, patients with subacute low back pain who received an intensive, in-person education session lasting at least two hours had better outcomes, with improved pain, function, and a quicker return to work than those receiving the usual care [
         <a href="#rid84">

         Pain neurophysiology education is a particular type of pain education that focuses upon the neurophysiology and psychosocial contributors of pain, rather than on the biomechanical aspects of pain. In a meta-analysis including seven randomized controlled trials and 313 patients with chronic low back pain, patients had moderate improvement in pain immediately following the intervention, with smaller improvements in pain and disability at three months [

         Back school is an intervention originally developed in Sweden consisting of education and a skill program including exercise therapy. Generally, lessons are provided to groups of patients and supervised by a physical therapist or other therapist trained in back rehabilitation, although the content of back school interventions vary and back school based on the traditional Swedish approach is not widely available in the United States. There is overlap between back school and group exercise, educational interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Back school may be a reasonable therapeutic option in patients with subacute or chronic low back pain who are interested in it, but there is limited evidence supporting its effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is low-quality evidence that back school was modestly more effective than no treatment for short-term pain control, but these effects were not seen in intermediate- or long-term follow-up [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87

However, longer-term outcomes are unknown, and some have raised concerns that use of a lumbar support device might lead to activity restriction by reinforcing awareness of a "back problem," thereby discouraging exercise participation. Thus, while lumbar supports are not routinely recommended, they may provide some benefit for patients with subacute low back pain who are actively engaged in recommended therapies and who will remain active.

         – In all patients with subacute or chronic low back pain, we recommend participation in regular exercise rather than no exercise (

         Exercise therapy is safe, readily available, helps alleviate pain symptoms, and improves function in all patients with low back pain. Most exercise therapies appear to be similarly effective, and the decision on which type of exercise to recommend should be based upon practical considerations, including local availability, patient preferences and abilities, possible insurance coverage issues, and previous history of success (or lack of success) with a particular exercise program.

          Additional interventions for those at risk for developing chronic low back pain and disability
         </strong>
         – The use of other treatments in addition to self-care advice and exercise therapies depends upon the patients’ risk factors for the development of chronic pain and chronic low back pain-related disability. In all patients with subacute low back pain who are at higher risk for developing chronic low back pain, we suggest referral for interventions that address psychosocial contributors to pain (in addition to self-care advice and exercise) (

          Adjunctive "passive" therapies for some patients with subacute low back pain

         – In addition to providing self-care advice, referring for exercise therapies, and CBT or MBSR, we refer some patients with subacute low back pain (those with more severe symptoms, and risk factors for chronicity including maladaptive behaviors and functional impairment) for short-term interventions such as spinal manipulation, acupuncture, or massage. These patients may benefit from "passive" treatments which may provide short-term symptomatic improvement, allowing them to participate in active therapies. (See

          Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy for subacute low back pain
         </strong>
         – In patients with subacute low back pain with more severe pain symptoms, we add adjunctive pharmacologic therapy for additional symptom management. Although nonpharmacologic therapy is generally preferred over pharmacologic therapy, they are commonly used together in clinical practice. The goal of medications is to provide symptomatic relief of pain symptoms while allowing the patient to participate in active therapies, including exercise, psychological, and/or mind-body interventions.

         <strong>
          Exercise plus psychological interventions for patients with chronic low back pain with disabling symptoms and functional impairment
         </strong>
         – Many patients with chronic low back pain may not have disabling symptoms or significant functional impairment. For these patients, education on the importance of participation in a regular exercise program is essential. Those patients with chronic low back pain and more severe, persistent, disabling symptoms and significant functional impairment require more intensive management strategies. For such patients, the goal of care is to manage pain, increase function, and maximize coping skills. For patients with chronic low back pain and persistent, disabling symptoms and significant functional impairment, we suggest utilizing a combination of exercise therapies and psychological and/or mind-body interventions, rather than exercise alone (

          Movement-based interventions with a mind-body component beneficial
         </strong>
         – Maintaining an emphasis on active therapy is consistent with a biopsychosocial approach to pain that engages patients in their care, more directly aiming to improve function, not just reduce pain. Movement-based interventions with a mind-body component, including Tai-chi and yoga, are particularly well suited for patients with low back pain and functional limitations. Exercise and movement-based therapies can be combined with CBT and mind-body interventions (MBSR, biofeedback, and progressive relaxation). (See

The goal of medications is to provide symptomatic relief of pain while allowing the patient to participate in active therapies (exercise and/or psychological treatments), encouraging increased function and improved coping. For patients with significant chronic low back pain who need adjunctive medication for symptom management, the supporting data on the duration of medication treatment are limited. Thus, limiting the duration of use for most medications is ideal, but not always possible.
