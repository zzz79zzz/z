DSDs with a genital appearance that is sufficiently atypical to prompt evaluation occur in approximately 1 in 1000 to 4500 live births [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of the infant with a DSD is presented here. Specific causes of DSDs and the management of affected infants are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5807.html" rel="external">"Management of the infant with atypical genital appearance (difference of sex development)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1775981257"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H720718128"><span class="h2">Difference of sex development</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic category "disorder of sex development (DSD)" was proposed in a 2006 consensus conference, replacing potentially pejorative terms including "pseudohermaphrodite," "hermaphrodite," and "intersex" [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Since then, many groups have modified the term to "difference of sex development" in response to concerns that "disorder" is unnecessarily negative [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>].</p><p>Concerns have been raised that DSD is an overly broad term that could be interpreted to encompass conditions in which no issues with genital appearance or gender identity are expected; and also that a broad umbrella term like DSD is unnecessary because it lacks sufficient specificity to be helpful diagnostically. Many patient support groups and advocacy groups do not accept the DSD designation and feel that it should be abandoned by the medical community.</p><p>Until a consensus is reached on this issue, we will use the term DSD but only apply it to patients with atypical development of the external genitalia. Many of these individuals present as newborns with an atypical genital appearance sometimes termed "ambiguous genitalia." We will not use the term to refer to conditions in which genital/gender discordance is not expected, such as Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, undescended testes, or isolated and nonsevere (standard) forms of hypospadias [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Indications for evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H733129805"><span class="h2">Glossary of other terms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vocabulary used to describe features of DSDs can also be confusing and is sometimes inconsistently applied. A glossary of terms is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118023" href="/z/d/graphic/118023.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4155782441"><span class="h1">TYPICAL SEX DEVELOPMENT AND ITS VARIATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A logical approach to the infant with a DSD requires an understanding of typical human sex development. This process is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7472.html" rel="external">"Typical sex development"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gonadal differentiation</strong> – The ovaries and testes derive from a primitive bipotential gonad. In typical XY individuals, expression of the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omim.org%2Fentry%2F480000&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl%2Fz7sFYUxH%2FjIS6Gc5RhMjOUmqwQPcx3uf1jweHlF3PkJAE1K&amp;TOPIC_ID=5803" target="_blank"><i>SRY</i></a> gene (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome) activates pathways that cause the gonads to differentiate as testes. In typical XX individuals, the absence of <em>SRY</em> and active repression of testicular pathways causes the gonads to differentiate into ovaries. Individuals with DSDs may have complete absence of gonadal development (complete gonadal dysgenesis), partial but incomplete gonadal development (partial gonadal dysgenesis), a gonad atypical for chromosomal sex (eg, XX testicular DSD), or a gonad with both ovarian and testicular features (an ovotestis).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gonadal function</strong> – The Leydig cells of the testis produce testosterone, which is converted to dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase type 2, which is expressed outside of the testis. Dihydrotestosterone and, to a lesser extent, testosterone activate the androgen receptor. The Leydig cells also produce insulin-like 3 (INSL3). The Sertoli cells of the testis produce anti-müllerian hormone (AMH; also known as müllerian-inhibiting substance [MIS] and müllerian regression factor). During embryonic and fetal development, the ovary does not produce significant amounts of testosterone, INSL3, or AMH. Individuals with DSDs may produce testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, INSL3, and AMH to varying degrees, depending on the underlying condition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gonadal position</strong> – In typical XY individuals, INSL3 and testosterone cause the gonads to descend into the scrotum. In typical XX individuals, these factors are absent and the gonads remain in the abdomen. Individuals with DSDs may have gonads located in the abdomen, the inguinal region, or the labioscrotal folds.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Development of the labioscrotal folds</strong> – The embryonic genital swellings give rise to the labioscrotal folds. In typical XY individuals, the action of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone cause the labioscrotal folds to fuse to form the scrotum and become rugated (wrinkled) and pigmented. In typical XX individuals, the labioscrotal folds remain unfused and develop into the labia majora. Individuals with DSDs may have varying degrees of fusion, rugation, and pigmentation of the labioscrotal folds, depending on the degree of androgen action.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Size and shape of the clitorophallus</strong> – In typical XY individuals, the action of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone cause the genital tubercle to increase in size and straighten to form the penis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65480" href="/z/d/graphic/65480.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). In typical XX individuals, the genital tubercle develops into the clitoris. Individuals with DSDs may have varying degrees of size and curvature of the clitorophallus, depending on the degree of androgen action.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Location of the urethra</strong> – In typical XY individuals, androgen action causes the urethral plate to contribute to the penile urethra. The urethra within the glans penis forms by a complex process of tissue remodeling and canalization. The result is a urethral meatus (orifice) located at the tip of the glans penis. In typical XX individuals, the absence of androgen action allows the separation of the urinary and reproductive tracts and the development of distinct urethral and vaginal orifices. Individuals with DSDs may have a urethral meatus located anywhere between the tip of the glans and the perineum. Of note, some individuals may have a blind-ending dimple at the tip of the clitorophallus that may be mistaken for the urethral meatus. Partial androgen action may result in incomplete separation of the urinary and reproductive tracts, leading to a common urogenital sinus with a single orifice rather than separate urethral and vaginal tracts with distinct orifices.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Internal reproductive structures</strong> – In typical XY individuals, local testosterone secretion causes ipsilateral development of the Wolffian ducts into the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78289" href="/z/d/graphic/78289.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) and local AMH secretion leads to ipsilateral regression of the müllerian ducts. In typical XX individuals, the absence of androgen action results in regression of the Wolffian ducts and the absence of AMH leads to retention of the müllerian ducts, which develop into the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and upper two-thirds of the vagina. The lower portion of the vagina forms from urogenital sinus epithelium without müllerian or Wolffian input. Individuals with DSD may have varying degrees of development of Wolffian and müllerian structures, and asymmetric gonadal function may result in asymmetry of the internal reproductive structures.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3115618872"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3729090220"><span class="h2">Guiding principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians managing the initial care and evaluation of an infant with a suspected DSD should:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine an accurate diagnosis when possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid designating gender/sex, naming the child, or completing the birth certificate prematurely.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prevent the salt-wasting crisis that can occur with certain types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expedite a thorough workup to guide gender/sex designation (and, in particular, assessing the sex chromosome complement as quickly as possible), explaining the importance of this workup to families and acknowledging the distress that may be present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Place the DSD in an appropriate context (ie, the overall health of the baby).

Evaluation of adrenal function may require a stimulation test using adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). CAH is the most common cause of atypical genital appearance in infants and presents with varying degrees of virilization. It is important to diagnose and treat CAH promptly because of the associated risk for adrenal crisis, which can occur as early as five days of life [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

Three-dimensional sonography can be useful to better define the findings.

In some complicated cases (particularly those infants with elements of both male and female gonads/internal reproductive structures), laparoscopic visualization with gonadal biopsy may be required to completely inventory the reproductive structures.</p><p>Individuals with sex chromosome mosaicism and a 45,X karyotype in some cells are at risk for anomalies associated with Turner syndrome and require echocardiography, renal ultrasound, and hearing screening to screen for cardiac defects, anatomic kidney anomalies, and hearing impairment, respectively.

Some DSDs present with an atypical genital appearance that does not permit gender designation at birth; others present with genital appearance that is discordant with genetic sex. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Guiding principles</strong> – The evaluation of infants with atypical genitalia should be undertaken as soon as possible. This is because congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), the most common cause of DSD, can be life-threatening. In addition, a DSD is perceived as distressing by most families and calls for immediate sensitive and professional counseling and psychosocial support. (See <a class="local">'Guiding principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial evaluation</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Key clinical features of infants with a DSD can include bilaterally nonpalpable testes  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73353" href="/z/d/graphic/73353.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), microphallus, scrotal or perineal hypospadias  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046" href="/z/d/graphic/58046.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), clitoromegaly  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64870 graphicRef76693" href="/z/d/graphic/64870.html" rel="external">picture 5A-B</a>), posterior labial fusion  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51835" href="/z/d/graphic/51835.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>), or palpable gonad(s) in the labioscrotal folds  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78743" href="/z/d/graphic/78743.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laboratory tests</strong> – Initial laboratory testing should include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Expedited karyotype or other method to rapidly assess the sex chromosome complement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) for infants without palpable gonads, as a screen for CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Serum electrolytes, measured every 24 to 48 hours until CAH is excluded, to monitor for the possibility of salt wasting due to adrenal insufficiency, which can be life-threatening.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Because salt wasting is also associated with some less common types of CAH, there should be a low threshold for evaluating for these disorders by measuring dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17-hydroxypregnenolone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107536" href="/z/d/graphic/107536.html" rel="external">table 5</a>), especially in any infant with evidence of salt loss. (See <a class="local">'Initial laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Imaging</strong> – Pelvic and abdominal ultrasonography should be performed to determine whether gonads, uterus, and vagina are present. (See <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interpretation and initial categorization of DSD</strong> – The results of the examination and initial laboratory testing should permit classification of the infant into one of three broad categories: XX DSD, XY DSD, or sex chromosome DSD. The infant can then be further evaluated to determine the nature of the underlying disorder within each of these categories, as outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118482" href="/z/d/graphic/118482.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In XX infants, the most common cause of atypical genitalia is CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency; the differential diagnosis also includes less common causes of CAH, gestational hyperandrogenism, testicular DSD, ovotesticular DSD, and aromatase deficiency  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56975" href="/z/d/graphic/56975.html" rel="external">table 3A</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In XY infants, the differential diagnosis includes defects in testicular development, defects in testosterone/dihydrotestosterone synthesis, and androgen insensitivity. Defects in testosterone synthesis can be seen in uncommon forms of CAH, most of which have a risk for adrenal crisis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107536" href="/z/d/graphic/107536.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In addition to measurements of 17-hydroxypregnenolone and cortisol, the evaluation should include measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81145" href="/z/d/graphic/81145.html" rel="external">table 3B</a>). Patients with an XY DSD without a diagnosis after laboratory evaluation should have a genetic evaluation, which can identify many causes of an XY DSD that do not result in obvious biochemical anomalies. (See <a class="local">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>More details on specific disorders are discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – The management of these infants requires a multidisciplinary team including specialists from pediatric endocrinology, genetics, and pediatric surgery/urology as well as psychology, psychiatry, or social work.
