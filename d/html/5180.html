Systemic cancers most likely to metastasize to the CNS include lung cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer. Primary brain tumors include a number of histologic types with markedly different tumor growth rates  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134980 graphicRef109511 graphicRef109513 graphicRef109517 graphicRef109515 graphicRef72593 graphicRef109467" href="/z/d/graphic/134980.html" rel="external">table 1A-G</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5211.html" rel="external">"Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas, glioneuronal tumors, and neuronal tumors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5217.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases"</a>.)</p><p>Brain tumors can produce symptoms and signs by local brain invasion, compression of adjacent structures, and increased intracranial pressure (ICP). In addition to the histology of the tumor, the clinical manifestations are determined by the function of the involved areas of the brain. The proper evaluation of the patient with a suspected brain tumor requires a detailed history, comprehensive neurologic examination, and appropriate diagnostic neuroimaging studies.</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary and secondary brain tumors in adults will be reviewed here. The evaluation of brain masses in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3718.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with HIV and central nervous system lesions"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3919108933"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The age-adjusted incidence rate of primary brain and nervous system tumors in the United States is estimated to be 25 per 100,000 persons [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of tumors are malignant, and the remainder are nonmalignant. Meningiomas and glial tumors (eg, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) account for approximately two-thirds of all primary brain tumors in adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81566" href="/z/d/graphic/81566.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5220.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma"</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of various tumor types and grades varies by age group. In adolescents and young adults, primary brain tumors are more common than metastatic tumors, and among primary brain tumors, low-grade gliomas predominate  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72275" href="/z/d/graphic/72275.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). In adults above the age of 30 to 40 years, metastatic brain tumors become increasingly prevalent, accounting for more than half of all brain tumors. Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 64 years.</p><p>Most primary brain tumors in adults are sporadic, with no identifiable risk factors. Aside from relatively rare genetic syndromes such as neurofibromatosis and cancer predisposition syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni, the only established risk factor for primary brain tumors is exposure to ionizing radiation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5214.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for brain tumors", section on 'Ionizing radiation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5214.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for brain tumors", section on 'Genetic predisposition syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with brain tumors may present with generalized and/or focal signs and symptoms or they may be asymptomatic  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52235" href="/z/d/graphic/52235.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>Symptoms of high-grade gliomas and metastases typically progress over days to weeks, whereas symptoms of low-grade gliomas and other indolent tumors may progress over months to years. Absence of symptoms is more common with low-grade tumors and small lesions without surrounding edema.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2785149584"><span class="h2">Headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Headache is a common manifestation of brain tumors and a presenting symptom in up to half of patients. Conversely, brain tumors are an uncommon cause of headaches and make up a very small proportion of all headaches in general medical practice. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3349.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of headache in adults", section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Headaches associated with brain tumors are usually dull and constant, but occasionally throbbing. The most common headache quality is tension-type (40 to 80 percent), followed by migrainous (10 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Headaches are often bifrontal in location, worse on the same side as the tumor.</p><p>Symptom severity tends to progress over time. Severe headaches are infrequent unless increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or meningeal irritation is present. The "classic" early morning brain tumor headache appears to be uncommon.</p><p>Patients may report worsening of headache after a change in body position, such as bending over, or with maneuvers that raise intrathoracic pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or the Valsalva maneuver. These activities lead to a period of raised ICP, which uncommonly can cause a loss of consciousness. (See <a class="local">'Increased intracranial pressure'</a> below.)</p><p>Tumor-related headaches may be worse at night and may awaken the patient. This nocturnal pattern is thought to be due in part to transient increases in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, a potent vasodilator, during sleep. Other possible physiologic explanations include recumbency and decreased cerebral venous return.</p><p>Other features suggestive of a brain tumor or other causes of secondary headache in a patient complaining of headaches include new and progressive symptoms, morning nausea and vomiting, a significant change in prior headache pattern, and an abnormal neurologic examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3349.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of headache in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Brain tumor headaches are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14113.html" rel="external">"Brain tumor headache"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H728505824"><span class="h2">Seizures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Focal seizures are among the most common symptoms of primary and metastatic brain tumors. Seizures affect 50 to 80 percent of patients with primary brain tumors and 10 to 20 percent of patients with metastatic tumors. Among primary brain tumors, low-grade tumors are more likely to cause seizures than high-grade tumors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5181.html" rel="external">"Seizures in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of focal seizures depend upon tumor location. As an example, frontal lobe tumors may cause focal tonic-clonic movements involving one extremity, while seizures originating within the occipital lobe may cause visual disturbances. Temporal lobe seizures are often the most difficult to diagnose and localize. In this setting, abrupt sudden behavioral changes may occur with or without typical preseizure auras, such as abnormal smell, taste, or gastrointestinal symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2231.html" rel="external">"Focal epilepsy: Causes and clinical features", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Tumor-related seizures are typically repetitive and are stereotyped in a given patient. The ictal event may be preceded by an aura, which is itself a brief focal seizure, and followed by postictal sequelae. The postictal phase can be manifested as a period of fatigue and an urge to sleep. For patients with focal seizures, a postictal paresis (also known as a Todd paralysis) may be present.</p><p>Focal-onset seizures in any location can evolve into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. If seizure propagation is rapid or if the initial phase of the seizure is unwitnessed, the presenting seizure may appear as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Subtle or brief focal seizures may go on for months before a generalized seizure brings the patient to medical attention, particularly in the case of low-grade primary brain tumors.</p><p>Both primary and metastatic brain tumors can cause status epilepticus, which may occur at the time of tumor diagnosis or subsequently [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2217.html" rel="external">"Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Patients who present with seizures usually have smaller primary brain tumors or fewer metastatic lesions in the brain, compared with those who present with other symptoms. This is probably because the diagnosis of a seizure is an indication for neuroimaging, which leads to an earlier diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2219.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults"</a>.)</p><p>A seizure should not be confused with a syncopal event that may be caused by an abrupt increase in ICP. This distinction is important since treatment is different in the two conditions. Patients with seizures are high risk for seizure recurrence and should be treated with antiseizure medications. By contrast, patients with increased ICP require urgent glucocorticoids, neurosurgical intervention, or both. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5181.html" rel="external">"Seizures in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors", section on 'Approach to management'</a> and <a class="local">'Increased intracranial pressure'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5182.html" rel="external">"Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Focal deficits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Focal signs and symptoms of brain tumors vary based on tumor location. Symptoms may be caused by local tissue disruption, mass effect on nearby structures, or vasogenic edema.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Weakness</strong> – Muscle weakness is a common complaint in patients with brain tumors. The manifestations may be subtle, particularly in the early stages. For upper motor neuron lesions, weakness is generally more pronounced in the flexors of the lower extremities than in the extensors, and more pronounced in the extensors than the flexors in the upper extremities. Transient weakness may represent a postictal state, as in Todd paralysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5095.html" rel="external">"The detailed neurologic examination in adults"</a> and <a class="local">'Seizures'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A key feature of tumor-related muscle weakness is its frequent responsiveness to glucocorticoids, particularly with tumors that are near the motor cortex or its descending fibers. A response to steroids usually means that the weakness is caused by edema and not by direct tumor involvement, as is often the case with metastatic tumors. In such patients, tumor resection may relieve mass effect and lessen the glucocorticoid requirement, even if surgery itself is not curative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5182.html" rel="external">"Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors", section on 'Symptomatic treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5212.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of brain metastases", section on 'Single brain metastasis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sensory loss</strong> – Cortical sensory deficits (abnormalities in graphesthesia or stereognosis) can develop in patients whose tumors involve the primary sensory cortex. These sensory deficits usually do not respect a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5096.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with sensory loss", section on 'Sensory examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The type of deficit varies in part with location of the tumor. As an example, visual-spatial disconnection syndromes can be found in patients with tumors located in the visual association cortex. Other cortically based sensory deficits include loss of spatial orientation, tingling, and lack of coordination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aphasia</strong> – Patients with a tumor in the language-dominant hemisphere may present with variable degrees and types of aphasia. The left hemisphere is dominant in &gt;95 percent of right-handed people and in &gt;70 percent of left-handed people [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5106.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with aphasia", section on 'Cerebral dominance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Symptoms range from occasional word-finding hesitation or word substitutions in routine speech to severe expressive or receptive aphasia. Tumors in the frontal lobe near Broca's area typically produce a nonfluent or expressive aphasia, whereas tumors in the posterior temporal lobe more often cause difficulties with language comprehension (receptive aphasia). Tumors in the dominant parietal lobe and thalamus also commonly cause language dysfunction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5106.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with aphasia", section on 'Aphasia syndromes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A formal assessment of language dominance and localization using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other techniques is often required in patients with aphasia to determine the feasibility of surgical resection. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative planning'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Visual-spatial dysfunction</strong> – The visual pathway courses through the brain from the retina and optic chiasm to the occipital poles of the cerebral cortex. Because of its long course through the brain, the visual pathway can be affected by brain tumors that involve any of these areas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Tumor-related compression of the optic chiasm usually manifests as a bitemporal hemianopsia. However, there may be a unilateral hemianopsia with a central scotoma in the contralateral eye in the early stages, particularly when the compression is on one side. The latter is thought to result from partial compression of the Wilbrand knee in the contralateral optic nerve, although the existence of this pathway has been questioned [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6632.html" rel="external">"Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5226.html" rel="external">"Optic pathway glioma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Postchiasmatic lesions also may present with visual abnormalities. Because the visual fibers are more spread apart before they converge in the occipital lobe, the more anterior the lesion in the optic radiation, the more asymmetric the hemianopsia (incongruous hemianopsia). Lesions in the occipital cortex cause congruous hemianopsia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5247.html" rel="external">"Homonymous hemianopia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H790177212"><span class="h2">Cognitive dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cognitive dysfunction, which includes memory problems and mood or personality change, is common among patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors.</p><p>Most of the neurocognitive deficits associated with brain tumors are subtle. Patients often complain of having low energy, fatigue, an urge to sleep, and loss of interest in everyday activities. They may become abulic and show a lack of spontaneity. This pattern of symptoms can be confused with depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Because these symptoms lack specificity, they are often recognized in retrospect by the patient or the treating clinician. Thus, consideration should be given to neuroimaging to rule out a brain tumor in patients without a prior history of depression who experience new onset of depressive symptoms without obvious cause.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3632568840"><span class="h2">Increased intracranial pressure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Increased ICP can arise either from a large mass or from restriction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow causing hydrocephalus. Symptoms may be subtle or consist of the classic triad of headache, nausea, and papilledema. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1659.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Nausea and vomiting are not specific to high ICP and can occur with more common causes of headache, such as migraine. Several characteristics suggest the possibility of tumor-associated emesis, such as triggering emesis by an abrupt change in body position. More importantly, neurogenic nausea and vomiting usually occur in the context of other neurologic symptoms such as headache or focal neurologic deficit; these signs and symptoms may be subtle, however.</p><p>In the presence of a large brain tumor or one associated with hydrocephalus, the ICP may be raised to a level that reduces brain compliance; in this setting, even a further small increase in intracranial fluid volume can result in dramatic elevations in ICP.</p><p>A significant rise in ICP can temporarily decrease cerebral perfusion, leading to loss of consciousness. Patients with a baseline elevation in ICP are particularly susceptible to this sequence of events in association with plateau waves, which are sustained increases in ICP caused by activities that transiently raise the ICP. Activities that may trigger a plateau wave include moving from a sitting to standing position and maneuvers that increase intrathoracic pressure, such as the Valsalva maneuver, coughing, sneezing, or vomiting.</p><p>A syncopal episode due to high ICP may simulate a seizure, since patients suffer loss of consciousness and may have a few tonic-clonic jerks. Identification of plateau wave-related episodes of loss of consciousness is critical, since these events identify patients who require urgent glucocorticoids and/or neurosurgical intervention to reduce elevated ICP rather than treatment with an antiseizure medication. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5182.html" rel="external">"Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors", section on 'Symptomatic treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h1">NEUROIMAGING FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is the optimal study for the evaluation of brain tumors. Computed tomography (CT) has much lower soft-tissue resolution and is relied upon primarily in emergency settings, for a more detailed view of bony structures, and in patients with a contraindication to MRI.</p><p>Typical MRI features of the more common brain tumors in adults are reviewed below. None of these imaging findings are specific, however, and histopathologic sampling is required to establish both tumor type and grade in the majority of primary brain tumors and in some cases of suspected brain metastases. However, this may change in the future as technology advances [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1022207650"><span class="h2">High-grade glioma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High-grade gliomas are typically hypointense masses on T1-weighted images that enhance heterogeneously following contrast infusion. Enhancing tumor can be distinguished from the surrounding hypointense signal of edema on T1-weighted sequences  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65860" href="/z/d/graphic/65860.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Vasogenic edema is common and appears as hyperintense signal abnormality in the white matter on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted imaging.</p><p>Glioblastomas often have thick rim enhancement along the margins of the tumor, with central lack of enhancement indicative of central necrosis or cystic change  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113733" href="/z/d/graphic/113733.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Gradient-echo or susceptibility-weighted sequences may show susceptibility artifact consistent with blood products within the center of the tumor.

However, if a patient has a primary tumor that does not usually metastasize to the brain (eg, prostate cancer), there is no known primary or the primary is temporally distant without recent relapse, or neuroimaging is not typical for metastasis, biopsy or resection may be indicated to define the etiology of a brain lesion.</p><p>The importance of biopsy in such situations was illustrated in a randomized trial of surgery for the treatment of solitary brain metastases, in which 11 percent of patients had a second primary malignancy, inflammatory process, or infection rather than metastasis [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. A tissue diagnosis can also be important for the determination of actionable mutations or immunohistochemical characteristics that indicate responsiveness to immunotherapy.</p><p>The management of patients with brain metastases is dependent upon the overall condition of the patient, as well as the number, size, and location of brain metastases. Depending on the primary cancer type, the initial treatment approach may include targeted therapy or immunotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The management of patients with brain metastases is discussed separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5230.html" rel="external">"Management of known or presumed benign (WHO grade 1) meningioma", section on 'Small, asymptomatic tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic meningiomas and asymptomatic tumors that are large, expanding, infiltrating, or associated with surrounding edema are surgically resected if feasible. Complete surgical resection is preferred when a meningioma is in an accessible location, since complete resection of the tumor and its dural attachment can be curative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5230.html" rel="external">"Management of known or presumed benign (WHO grade 1) meningioma", section on 'Large or symptomatic tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Empiric radiation therapy without a histologic diagnosis may be warranted in carefully selected cases for lesions in a surgically inaccessible location.

A smear or frozen section can be performed rapidly during the surgery for a preliminary interpretation of the histologic subtype. With this information, the neurosurgeon can make a decision whether or not to proceed with a more extensive resection.</p><p>A definitive diagnosis requires examination of the permanent tissue sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin and a variety of immunohistochemical stains. Molecular testing is increasingly important in the diagnosis and classification of brain tumors, especially for diffuse gliomas [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. For these tumors, routine pathologic evaluation includes IDH mutational testing and a number of additional molecular tests to allow for an integrated diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134946" href="/z/d/graphic/134946.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134980" href="/z/d/graphic/134980.html" rel="external">table 1A</a>).

This is particularly true for glial tumors because regional heterogeneity and sampling error may underestimate the histologic grade of malignancy [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Molecular studies, including testing for IDH, 1p/19q, telomerase reverse transcriptase (<em>TERT</em>) promoter mutation, and H3 K27M, may help to improve diagnostic accuracy in these circumstances. Next-generation sequencing may be of value for identifying pathogenic variants that are susceptible to treatment with specific targeted therapies [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

A CT of the chest and abdomen should be performed when metastatic disease is suspected.
