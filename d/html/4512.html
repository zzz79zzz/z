This acquired genetic abnormality produces BCR-ABL1, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that causes CML and is the target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). CML is a triphasic disease, in which approximately 85 to 90 percent of patients present in a chronic stable phase and the remainder initially present in accelerated phase or blast crisis. Without treatment, chronic phase CML inevitably progresses to accelerated phase/blast crisis, but treatment with TKIs has dramatically reduced the rate of progression to blast crisis. </p><p>Treatment of CML in blast crisis is discussed here. </p><p>Related topics include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4543.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4496.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4508.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4515.html" rel="external">"Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase after failure of initial therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4514.html" rel="external">"Accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia: Diagnosis and treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4494.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4537.html" rel="external">"Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1955591774"><span class="h1">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the complexity of cancer care. Important issues include balancing the risk from treatment delay versus harm from COVID-19, ways to minimize negative impacts of social distancing during care delivery, and appropriately and fairly allocating limited health care resources. These issues and recommendations for cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128993.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Considerations in patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF BLAST CRISIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blast crisis of CML is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) by one of the following features [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>≥20 percent blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extramedullary proliferation of blasts (ie, myeloid sarcoma) </p><p></p><p>Previously, some definitions of blast crisis used a threshold of ≥30 percent blasts in bone marrow, and this should be kept in mind when interpreting older studies. Nevertheless, patients in blast crisis have a poor prognosis regardless of the defining threshold [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Most cases of CML blast crisis are myeloid, but in 20 to 30 percent of cases the blasts are lymphoid [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93914312"><span class="h1">EVALUATION UPON TRANSFORMATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with CML typically present in chronic phase and in the tyrosine kinase treatment era, and progression to blast crisis in patients who achieve and maintain a complete cytogenetic remission two years after diagnosis, is very rare. In contrast, before these drugs were available, the median time to progression was three to four years after diagnosis. Thus, most cases of blast crisis will have a known diagnosis of CML at the time of transformation. A minority of patients with CML will be in blast crisis at the time of diagnosis. </p><p>Transformation may be suggested clinically by the development of signs and symptoms more typical of acute leukemia (eg, night sweats, weight loss, fever, bone pain, symptoms of anemia and bleeding). Evaluation of the patient with suspected blast crisis includes the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, and glucose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be sent for pathology review, flow cytometry, cytochemistry, and cytogenetics.

Lymphoid blast crisis often responds to treatments used for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). </p><p>Most cases of lymphoid blast crisis develop in patients who are currently being treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or were previously treated with a TKI. For such patients, a switch to a second or third generation TKI is necessary. A TKI can be administered alone or in combination with lower intensity chemotherapy. Choice of TKI and chemotherapy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16661.html" rel="external">"Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults", section on 'TKI plus chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>For the rare patient who has not been treated with a TKI, therapy should be given as described for "de novo" Ph+ ALL. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16661.html" rel="external">"Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Retrospective studies have reported on the outcomes of patients with lymphoid blast crisis treated with regimens for Ph+ ALL. In one single institution study, 42 patients with lymphoid blast phase CML were treated with hyperfractionated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/z/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/z/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> (Hyper-CVAD) alternating with high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/z/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">cytarabine</a> plus either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">imatinib</a> (27 patients) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8852" href="/z/d/drug information/8852.html" rel="external">dasatinib</a> (15 patients) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The majority (90 percent) achieved a complete hematologic response, with complete cytogenetic remission and complete molecular remission occurring in 58 and 25 percent, respectively. Median duration of remission was 14 months, and median overall survival was 17 months. Allogeneic HCT was associated with longer median survival (93 versus 9 months).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93914267"><span class="h2">Myeloid blast crisis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Myeloid blast crisis (ie, acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) accounts for approximately 70 percent of CML blast crisis [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>The preferred initial treatment is the use of a TKI (with or without chemotherapy) followed by an allogeneic HCT for eligible patients. The decision to incorporate AML-type induction chemotherapy into the treatment regimen depends upon whether the patient presents de novo or evolves to blast crisis while on a TKI. Although we treat de novo myeloid blast crisis with TKI alone until we can assess the response, if myeloid blast crisis develops while a patient is already taking a TKI, we administer AML-type induction chemotherapy combined with a more potent TKI for remission induction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4525.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Induction therapy in medically fit adults"</a>.)</p><p>Survival after allogeneic HCT correlates with disease phase at the time of transplantation with estimated two-year survival rates of 25, 50, and 65 percent for those in blast crisis, accelerated phase, and chronic phase, respectively [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A reasonable plan is an attempt to return the patient to an earlier phase of disease, with suitable candidates subsequently undergoing allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. TKI treatment prior to transplantation has not been associated with an increase in transplant-associated morbidity or mortality [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4494.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia", section on 'Pretreatment with TKIs'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93914621"><span class="h2">Choice of TKI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a paucity of data regarding the choice of TKI to be used as the initial therapy for patients with blast crisis, regardless of whether the patient is a candidate for HCT. In general, we suggest treatment with a second generation TKI (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8852" href="/z/d/drug information/8852.html" rel="external">dasatinib</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9448" href="/z/d/drug information/9448.html" rel="external">nilotinib</a>) rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">imatinib</a>. Second generation TKIs should certainly be used if the disease progression/blast crisis occurred while the patient was already taking imatinib for earlier stage CML. Similarly, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="87456" href="/z/d/drug information/87456.html" rel="external">ponatinib</a> can be considered if the progression occurred while the patients was receiving dasatinib, nilotinib, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86371" href="/z/d/drug information/86371.html" rel="external">bosutinib</a>. This preference is largely based on the extrapolation of data from randomized trials of these agents as initial therapy in patients with chronic phase CML. In these trials, second generation TKIs resulted in faster and deeper responses than imatinib, especially among patients with higher risk chronic phase CML [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>]. Given the expected lower response rates in blast crisis, the greater potency of these agents would be expected to have an even more important role. In addition, second generation TKIs have been proven to induce responses in imatinib-resistant CML, and this resistance is more likely to occur in blast crisis. </p><p>A choice among agents should also take into consideration the drug side effect profiles, results from a <em>BCR-ABL1</em> kinase mutation analysis, and the patient's comorbidities (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89930" href="/z/d/graphic/89930.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8852" href="/z/d/drug information/8852.html" rel="external">Dasatinib</a> has the advantage of being able to cross the blood brain barrier. The following sections review data regarding their use in blast crisis. Randomized trials comparing these agents in chronic phase CML are presented separately. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H433741736"><span class="h3">Imatinib</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">Imatinib</a> is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults in blast crisis. The approved dose in this setting is 600 mg by mouth daily. The following is a summary of trials that have investigated the use of imatinib in the treatment of CML in blast crisis. It should be noted that these trials were conducted in the "pre-imatinib" era and hence these patients had not previously been treated with a TKI:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a dose-escalating pilot study, patients with CML in blast crisis (defined in this study as &gt;30 percent blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow) were treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">imatinib</a> at doses ranging from 300 to 1000 mg/day [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. On an intent-to-treat basis, the following results were reported:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Overall response rates were 55 and 70 percent in patients with myeloid and lymphoid blast crises, respectively.

Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 40 and 33 percent, respectively. None of the 16 deaths in the study was thought to be related to treatment with this agent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An analysis of 260 patients with CML in blast crisis from three large phase II studies evaluated the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">imatinib</a> 600 mg daily [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

A variety of monitoring schedules for patients with CML are acceptable. Patients in blast crisis need to be seen frequently for management of cytopenias and frequently require red blood cell and platelet transfusion. Post-transfusion platelet increments are often compromised by the splenomegaly that commonly accompanies blast crisis.

As such, all patients should be referred to a transplant center at the time of transformation for transplant eligibility. Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions. Although data supporting such criteria are limited, patients are often excluded based on age (&gt;70 years old), uncontrolled infection, cardiac, pulmonary, liver or renal dysfunction, and/or psychosocial variables.

We suggest transplantation once a maximum response to a TKI has been realized rather than continuation of the TKI without HCT. The rationale for this approach is that success with HCT is most likely in patients with relatively quiescent disease. There are no data comparing continuation of a TKI versus transplantation in the relatively small group of patients in whom a complete cytogenetic response is obtained with TKI treatment. There is concern, however, that if HCT is postponed until a second TKI is required for relapse, the chance of inducing a similar level of response is lower. </p><p>Treatment with a TKI is given prior to HCT in an attempt to return the patient to an earlier phase of disease. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">Imatinib</a> treatment for blast crisis can result in objective responses in approximately half of patients with 15 percent attaining a second chronic phase [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Responses appear to be higher for those treated with second generation TKIs. Because of the truly transient nature of responses in this phase of CML, treatment with imatinib alone should be considered palliative and is not an appropriate longer term treatment alternative for patients who are eligible for HCT.</p><p>It is uncertain whether there is any benefit to using a TKI after HCT for patients transplanted for chronic phase CML if a complete molecular remission has been achieved; however, we recommend a TKI if a reduced intensity regimen is utilized for the transplant. Frequent <em>BCR-ABL1</em> measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring is advisable for such patients. For patients transplanted for CML in myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis, we suggest the use of a TKI for two years after allogeneic HCT, if tolerable, rather than postponing its use until the emergence of MRD positivity, especially if nonmyeloablative conditioning is used. It should be noted, however, that there are few data about whether longer use of a TKI is advisable.</p><p>Chemotherapy alone has been used for patients in blast crisis in an attempt to return the patient to an earlier phase of disease and then proceed with transplantation in eligible patients [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].
