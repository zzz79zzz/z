         Deficiency of antithrombin (AT; antithrombin III) can be inherited or acquired; it is defined as an AT activity level that is consistently less than 80 percent of normal (or the lower limit of the assay's reference range).
        </p>
        <p>
         In some patients, AT deficiency can be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. The availability of plasma-derived AT concentrates and recombinant AT has made replacement therapy possible, but the approved use of these products is limited to patients with hereditary AT deficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the causes, evaluation, and management of inherited and acquired AT deficiencies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional topic reviews discuss other inherited thrombophilias and their management.

         Antithrombin (AT, previously called AT III, also known as heparin cofactor I) is a natural anticoagulant. It inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and other serine proteases in the coagulation cascade such as factor IXa  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873" href="/z/d/graphic/90873.html" rel="external">

         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of hemostasis", section on 'Control mechanisms and termination of clotting'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         AT is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin), a specific type of enzyme inhibitor. AT has a reactive center at position Arg393-Ser394 that interacts with the active site serine residue of the coagulation factor protease, and a heparin-binding site, which is distinct from the reactive center. Following the administration of heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight [LMW]) or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8691" href="/z/d/drug information/8691.html" rel="external">
          fondaparinux
         </a>
         , AT activity is accelerated dramatically due to a conformational change induced by heparin binding leading to enhanced exposure of the reactive center in AT. This conformational change converts AT from a slow inactivator of coagulation factors such as thrombin (factor IIa) to a rapid inactivator (1000-fold increase in AT activity) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]; the specific coagulation factor(s) affected depend on the size of the heparin molecule  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101832" href="/z/d/graphic/101832.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). It is thought that endogenous heparan sulfates in the intact endothelium provide this role in normal physiology, in turn localizing the inhibitory activity of AT to the endothelial surface of blood vessels and maintaining the fluidity of blood [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. AT may also have other roles such as reducing platelet adhesion to fibrinogen [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The half-life of AT is approximately 2.8 to 4.8 days. Production and turnover of AT both are highly regulated:

         AT is produced in the liver as a 464 amino acid precursor from which a 32 amino acid signal peptide is cleaved. The signal peptide plays a crucial role in translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum where cotranslational processing takes place [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>

         AT is present in plasma in two forms, an active monomer and an inactive "latent" form [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. One molecule of latent AT can inactivate one molecule of the active AT monomer through the formation of a heterodimer; in health, this process only contributes to the normal turnover of the protein in plasma. However, this process may account for increased thrombosis risk in carriers of rare unstable variants of AT during fever or illness.

         Thrombin cleaves the reactive center of AT, which is followed by the formation of an inactive complex that is rapidly cleared from the circulation.

         Healthy newborns have approximately 50 percent AT activity; this reaches adult levels by approximately six months of age [

          7-9
         </a>

         AT deficiency can be inherited or acquired. Inherited deficiencies are due to AT gene mutations (see
         <a class="local">
          'Genetics'
         </a>
         below). Acquired deficiencies can result from impaired production of functional AT (eg, due to liver disease, asparaginase therapy); protein losses (eg, in nephrotic syndrome) or accelerated consumption, as occurs in acute thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). (See
         <a class="local">

         Inheritance of AT deficiency is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Individuals who are heterozygous for a variant in
         <em>
          SERPINC1
         </em>
         have AT deficiency; homozygosity for AT deficiency is not seen, likely because it is not compatible with life. Children of affected individuals have an approximately 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition. However, not all individuals with laboratory evidence of AT deficiency will develop thrombosis or require anticoagulation.

         Hundreds of pathogenic variants, including point mutations, insertions, and deletions, have been identified in

          Type I deficiency
         </strong>
         – Type I hereditary AT deficiency (reduced AT level) is usually caused by a small deletion or insertion, a larger deletion, or a single base substitution (mutation). Most of these changes in genetic sequence lead to reduced synthesis of the protein. Other changes may affect the signal peptide and impair post-translational processing or alter AT protein stability [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,16-20

         – Type II hereditary AT deficiency (functional deficiency) is caused by a number of pathogenic variants that affect different aspects of protein function.

         Increased thrombotic risk may be seen in individuals with inherited or some forms of acquired AT deficiency such as asparaginase chemotherapy (see
         <a class="local">
          'Thrombosis'
         </a>
         below). The reduced level of AT (typically, approximately 50 percent of normal, range 40 to 60 percent) can lead to uncontrolled thrombin generation and fibrin deposition within the vasculature. This mechanism contrasts with coagulation factor deficiencies, in which heterozygosity for a mutation typically is associated with a benign carrier condition and reduction of plasma activity levels to approximately half of normal rarely have clinical consequences.

         Insensitivity to heparin is seen in some individuals with AT deficiency (see
         <a class="local">
          'Heparin resistance'
         </a>
         below). This occurs because heparins require AT to inactivate coagulation enzymes. In contrast, direct inhibitors of coagulation enzymes such as direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors do not require AT.

        </p>
        <p>
         Antithrombin function is not assessed by routine coagulation tests such as the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT); thus, results of these tests are not affected by AT deficiency.

          46-49
         </a>
         ]. Of interest, in one study that recalled 59 individuals who initially tested as AT deficient, repeat testing revealed AT deficiency in only three, none of whom had a personal or family history of thrombosis; an additional three had experienced an acute event such as a deep vein thrombosis at the time of the initial sample and may have had transient, acquired AT deficiency that had resolved at the time of retesting [

         Individuals with hereditary AT deficiency have an increased risk of VTE. Estimates of the degree of increased risk vary among populations. A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies showed that compared with controls, AT-deficient individuals had an odds ratio (OR) of VTE of 16.3 (95% CI 9.9-26.7); this was substantially higher than the VTE risk attributed to protein S or protein C deficiency (ORs 5.4 and 7.5, respectively)  (

        <p>
         In studies that focused on thrombophilic families in which at least one member had a history of thrombosis, the risk for VTE in relatives was approximately 1 percent annually [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54,55

         ]. Individuals who co-inherit a second thrombophilic defect are likely to have a greater risk. However, as noted above, some individuals with AT deficiency, especially those diagnosed incidentally (eg, during population screening) never have a VTE.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some series of individuals with AT deficiency who have a VTE, more than half have a spontaneous event; the remaining cases are associated with an acquired risk factor such as pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, surgery, or trauma [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55

          22,56-59

         ]. In a 2016 systematic review that included four case-control studies involving pregnancies in women with and without AT deficiency, the OR for VTE with AT deficiency was 6.1 (95% CI 1.6-23.4) [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. In another study, the risk of VTE was evaluated in 78 women with inherited AT deficiency, protein S deficiency, or protein C deficiency [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. In women with AT deficiency, deep vein thrombosis occurred in 18 percent during pregnancy and in 33 percent in the postpartum period. By comparison, thrombosis during pregnancy occurred in only 7 percent of patients with protein C deficiency and in none of the patients with protein S deficiency. Thrombosis in the postpartum period occurred in 19 percent of protein C and 17 percent of protein S deficient patients. This increased risk provides our rationale for administering AT concentrate to some individuals with hereditary AT deficiency who become pregnant, especially around the time of delivery. (See

         Rarely, individuals with hereditary AT deficiency have developed fibrin thrombi in the kidneys, leading to renal insufficiency. This creates challenges for managing hemodialysis. (See

         In some individuals with hereditary or acquired AT deficiency, anticoagulation with heparin is ineffective and the aPTT cannot be adequately prolonged. This occurs because heparin is an indirect inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa, and requires adequate levels of circulating AT in order be effective. (See

         Importantly, in individuals with a thromboembolic event for whom testing is indicated, AT levels should not be measured at the time of the acute event, because thrombosis may cause a transient reduction in AT levels that could be misinterpreted as an underlying inherited deficiency. If a low level is measured during an acute illness, this should be repeated when the individual has recovered. Testing using functional assays should not be performed while patients are taking certain anticoagulants. (See

         In the event that a patient with an acute VTE treated with heparin appears to have heparin resistance (due to failure of the activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] to prolong despite very high doses of heparin) and a low AT level is measured, it may not be possible to determine whether the low level is due to inherited deficiency or to acquired deficiency (which in turn may be due to thrombosis and/or heparin). In such cases, we would repeat the testing when the individual's medical condition has returned to baseline (eg, several weeks to months later). (See

         A functional assay for plasma AT activity (also called AT-heparin cofactor assay) is the best first test for AT deficiency [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,51
         </a>
         ]. The assay measures the ability of heparin to inhibit a coagulation factor (thrombin [factor IIa] or factor Xa), which requires AT activity  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101832" href="/z/d/graphic/101832.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). Guidance from the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommends a chromogenic assay [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We prefer factor Xa inhibition to thrombin inhibition, due to the increased specificity of factor Xa inhibition for AT deficiency. The rationale is that factor Xa is inhibited by AT (heparin cofactor I) alone via a heparin-dependent mechanism, whereas thrombin can also be inhibited by heparin cofactor II [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71-73
         </a>
         ]. Heparin cofactor II is an efficient inhibitor of thrombin in the presence of heparin concentrations used in the AT-heparin cofactor assay [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. As a result, an assay based on thrombin inhibition can be affected by differences in heparin cofactor II activity. The increased specificity of the factor Xa-based assay was illustrated in a study of 67 members of a family with type II AT deficiency (see
         <a class="local">
          'Genetics'
         </a>
         above) [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. In members with true AT deficiency based on genetic testing, the factor Xa-based assay was more reliable than the thrombin-based assay; six individuals might have been reported incorrectly as negative for the defect when tested with the thrombin-based assay.
        </p>
        <p>
         The factor Xa-based assay may be inaccurate in individuals with a specific AT mutation known as AT Cambridge (AT A384S). Factor Xa-based assays cannot be used to diagnose these individuals, and results from thrombin-based assays are only mildly decreased [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. The clinical relevance of this mutation remains unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most laboratories set the lower limit of normal for AT activity at approximately 80 percent (normal range, approximately 80 to 120 percent); the values are typically calculated as two standard deviations from the mean. Laboratory-specific values should be used to take into account instrument and assay variability. Patients with hereditary AT deficiency due to heterozygosity for a
         <em>
          SERPINC1
         </em>
         mutation usually have AT activity levels in the range of 40 to 60 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Assays for AT protein levels (rather than function) such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are also available [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,51,76
         </a>
         ]. However, these are less useful for initial testing because they do not reflect AT function and will fail to identify individuals with a type II defect (see
         <a class="local">
          'Genetics'
         </a>
         above). In some cases this testing can be done to distinguish between type I and type II defects in an individual with deficient AT activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         If needed, additional testing can be performed in specialized coagulation laboratories. As an example, a few specialized laboratories can perform the progressive AT activity assay, which quantifies the capacity of AT to neutralize the enzymatic activity of thrombin in the absence of heparin. This assay can be used to distinguish functional deficiency produced by defects in the AT thrombin binding site versus the heparin binding site. This additional testing is usually reserved for research purposes and is not widely available.
        </p>
        <p>
         Genetic testing is not routinely done but may be obtained from a specialty laboratory in selected cases [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. (See

         An important consideration in the laboratory evaluation of patients with suspected AT deficiency is the timing of testing. Erroneous diagnoses can be made due to the influence of acute thrombosis, comorbid illness, and/or anticoagulant therapy on AT activity levels [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients with an acute thromboembolic event or acute illness, testing should be delayed until the patient recovers or is no longer receiving an anticoagulant. If AT activity was measured in the setting of an acute thromboembolic event or systemic illness, it should be repeated when the patient is asymptomatic.

         The diagnosis of AT deficiency requires demonstration of a reduced plasma AT activity level in a patient who is not in the midst of an acute illness or surgery that could cause transient reduction in AT activity. In patients with hereditary AT deficiency, AT activity is generally well below the lower limit of the normal reference range of the laboratory performing the test.

          Inherited thrombophilias

         – Other inherited thrombophilias include the factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, and deficiencies of protein S or protein C. Like hereditary AT deficiency, these may be associated with a familial syndrome of increased thromboembolic disease. Unlike AT deficiency, these are not associated with low AT levels unless the patient has had a recent thrombosis. (See

          Acquired thrombophilias
         </strong>
         – Other acquired thrombophilias include a range of conditions such as nephrotic syndrome, some hemolytic anemias (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]), myeloproliferative neoplasms and other malignancies, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Other transient associations with increased thromboembolic risk include hospitalization for an acute medical illness or surgery or the presence of a central venous catheter. Like AT deficiency, these conditions may increase the risk of thromboembolism. Unlike AT deficiency, these more commonly present in adulthood, and AT levels will be normal in these disorders unless the patient has had a recent thrombosis or other acute illness. (See

          Causes of heparin resistance

         – Other causes of heparin resistance include increased clearance, increased levels of heparin-binding proteins, elevations of fibrinogen or factor VIII, and certain medications (eg, aprotinin). Like AT deficiency, these conditions lead to a requirement for unusually large doses of heparin. Unlike AT deficiency, these conditions often can be overcome by raising the heparin dose, and they do not improve with AT administration. (See

         Initial parenteral anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy, especially for severe thromboses. Data are limited, but clinical experience suggests that LMW heparin appears to be effective [

          warfarin

         or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). While the choice is individualized depending on a number of factors (severity of thrombosis, adherence, patient preference, potential dietary or drug interactions), we generally prefer LMW heparin followed by warfarin rather than a DOAC for patients with VTE in association with known hereditary AT deficiency.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Data on the efficacy of DOACs in individuals with AT deficiency are sparse, with only a few case reports of acute VTE treatment [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,78,79
         </a>
         ]. Most trials evaluating DOACs did not routinely screen participants for hereditary thrombophilia, so there may have been individuals with AT deficiency enrolled in these trials [

          warfarin

         includes more data and clinical experience and the ability to effectively monitor its anticoagulant effect using coagulation testing (prothrombin time [PT, with international normalized ratio [INR]). Furthermore, if needed, a higher INR goal can be targeted in highly thrombosis-prone individuals. Furthermore, if the individual has a recurrent event while receiving warfarin, it is readily possible to establish whether the individual was taking the anticoagulant and whether the level was in the desired therapeutic range.

         5 mg twice daily rather than rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily), assuming the individual's bleeding risk is not excessive.

Decisions regarding therapy are individualized depending on whether the patient is anticoagulated at the time the VTE develops (which would favor use of AT replacement) and the initial aPTT response to heparin therapy (heparin resistance would favor AT replacement; heparin resistance with AT being unavailable would favor switching to a non-heparin anticoagulant such as argatroban).

         When AT replacement is used, dosing is based on the patient’s baseline AT activity level and a target peak level of 120 percent of normal post-infusion. AT replacement can be stopped once the patient is stably anticoagulated with an oral anticoagulant and heparin is discontinued.

          67

         For individuals who do not have access to AT concentrates or recombinant AT, plasma products such as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) may provide some AT. However, the doses required may confer a significant volume load as well as risks for transfusion reactions.

         The concentrate and the recombinant product have not been compared directly to each other in a randomized trial. However, several large observational studies and trials comparing these products with placebo have reported that they are effective in facilitating AT replacement in individuals with heparin resistance and/or AT deficiency, and premarketing studies demonstrated a low rate of thrombosis when they were used in the perioperative or peripartum settings when anticoagulation was withheld [

         Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, and AT deficiency further elevates this risk. The majority of women with hereditary AT deficiency will already be receiving thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy (typically with low molecular weight [LMW] heparin), regardless of their personal or family history of thrombosis. (See

         Various approaches to the administration of AT during pregnancy and delivery have been used, including administration restricted to the time of delivery, for a few days before and after delivery, for six weeks postpartum, or for longer periods antepartum. AT may be continued during delivery to provide thromboprophylaxis when anticoagulation is withheld.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to AT administration depends on the patient’s personal and family history of thromboembolism  (

         For women with hereditary AT deficiency who develop a thromboembolism during pregnancy, we use therapeutic dose anticoagulation with LMW heparin for the remainder of the pregnancy, as discussed in detail separately. (See

         For women with hereditary AT deficiency and either a personal history of thrombosis or a compelling family history (eg, multiple family members with thrombosis, family member with unprovoked thrombosis), we suggest administering AT just prior to and at the time of delivery when anticoagulation cannot be administered (ie, from the time LMW or

         is discontinued in anticipation of delivery, until postpartum anticoagulation is resumed). This practice is based on the high risk of VTE during pregnancy in such patients and the efficacy of AT replacement described in case reports and our experience [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67

         Evidence for efficacy in the surgical setting is limited; there are no randomized trials. In a single arm study that included six surgical patients, use of recombinant AT (typically given together with postoperative anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis) was associated with good outcomes [

In a retrospective review of 23 patients undergoing various surgical procedures, mostly gynecologic, use of AT concentrate was associated with a reduced incidence of thromboembolic complications; however, numbers were small, and many of the patients who did not receive AT were given thromboprophylaxis with dextran, which is no longer used [

          —
         </span>
         The mechanism of VTE with asparaginase is multifactorial and involves decreased synthesis of asparagine-containing proteins such as AT as well as other global effects on protein synthesis [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97
         </a>
         ]. Plasma levels of several procoagulant and anticoagulant factors are reduced, and these reductions are thought to be at least partially responsible for the increased risks of bleeding and thrombosis, respectively. Affected factors besides AT include prothrombin; factors V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI; fibrinogen; protein C; protein S; von Willebrand factor (VWF); and plasminogen [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97-100
         </a>
         ]. However, the correlation between VTE risk and plasma levels of AT, protein S, or protein C is weak, suggesting other contributing factors [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101
         </a>
         ]. Asparaginase causes depletion of asparagine by catalyzing its hydrolysis to aspartic acid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Asparaginase also increases the risk of bleeding, which may be due to a combination of effects. There may be prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT), as well as hypofibrinogenemia with fibrinogen levels often &lt;100 mg/dL. Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia may contribute as well.

          103

         ]. There were four VTE events in 16 individuals 21 to 30 years of age (25 percent) and eight VTE events in 19 individuals &gt;30 years of age (42 percent). Sites of VTE were similar in adults as in children, with a trend for adults to experience more pulmonary emboli (PE). The risk of thromboembolic events appears to be greater in adults and individuals with high-risk ALL [

         asparaginase is an alternate preparation that may have fewer effects. In a series of 11 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated with
         <em>
          Erwinia
         </em>
         asparaginase, there was significant lowering of antithrombin levels, but vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors II, VII, and X remained within normal ranges [

         Other factors that may affect risk include the age of the patient, other coagulation factor deficiencies induced by the drug, or other prothrombotic conditions (eg, presence of a central venous catheter, vascular inflammation, leukemia cell lysis). (See

         As an alternative approach, some experts measure plasma fibrinogen levels and administer Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or Cryoprecipitate to reduce the risk of bleeding as well as thrombosis; FFP will supply a small amount of AT but is unlikely to raise levels to the normal range. The concentration of AT in Cryoprecipitate is similar to FFP. In a retrospective comparison of two cohorts of pediatric patients who were receiving asparaginase-containing therapy for ALL, the rate of cerebral vein thrombosis was lower in those who were treated with FFP or Cryoprecipitate compared with those who were not (0 of 240 versus of 7 of 479; 0 versus 1.5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid116">
          116

         ]. In the replacement cohort, criteria for giving FFP or Cryoprecipitate were an AT activity &lt;50 U/mL and/or a fibrinogen level &lt;100 mg/dL; this resulted in AT administration to nearly all of the patients. FFP was given to 37 percent and Cryoprecipitate was given to 68 percent; some children received both products. Chemotherapy was identical for the two cohorts, and other outcomes (remission rates, bleeding) were similar. The finding of similar remission rates makes the theoretical risk of reduced chemotherapy efficacy due to asparagine in plasma less of a concern. The authors suggested that prophylaxis might be most appropriate for patients with high-risk disease during induction chemotherapy. However, small series in which FFP was administered have not observed beneficial effects on in vitro coagulation parameters [

         For those who are adequately anticoagulated, the role of concomitant AT replacement is unclear. We suggest AT replacement, especially if it facilitates the completion of potentially curative chemotherapy. Other experts use FFP or Cryoprecipitate as a source of AT, and others use anticoagulation alone (without AT replacement), based on lack of high quality evidence that administering AT improves outcomes.

         Patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have been treated with AT products to improve heparinization and reduce the risk of thromboembolism. As an example, in a multicenter cohort of 4210 children who received AT concentrate over a 10-year period, ECMO was the most common clinical setting in which AT was used, representing 44 percent of the cohort [
         <a href="#rid119">
          119

        <p>
         The appropriate dose of AT in the setting of ECMO is unknown. In a study of five pediatric patients receiving ECMO who were treated with recombinant AT (median age one month, range one day to three years), starting doses in the range of approximately 100 to 500 units/kg/day were used, but it took approximately 12 hours to raise AT activity levels to 80 to 120 percent, leading the authors to suggest that higher starting doses may be appropriate [

         Rarely, patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis will have concurrent AT deficiency. This may present a challenge in the management of hemodialysis anticoagulation because heparin may not effectively anticoagulate these individuals during the dialysis procedure (see

        <p>
         Some patients with heparin resistance due to AT deficiency may benefit from AT replacement. This was illustrated in a cohort of nine children with hereditary AT deficiency who were treated with heparin for a thromboembolic event; two required AT replacement therapy for anticoagulation to reach therapeutic levels [
         <a href="#rid43">

         The decision to use AT replacement versus an alternative must be individualized according to the patient’s age, clinical status, and the reason for anticoagulation.

         Overall, hereditary AT deficiency is not thought to be associated with a higher mortality rate than the general population, despite the increased risk of thromboembolic events and possible requirement for anticoagulant therapy [

        <p>
         Some reports have suggested that AT deficiency in the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or sepsis confers a worse prognosis. However, we do not perform AT testing in these settings, nor do we consider AT levels an important prognostic factor; prognosis is much better estimated using other clinical variables and much better improved by appropriate therapy directed at the underlying disease.

          Definition and biology
         </strong>
         – Antithrombin (AT, previously called AT III, also known as heparin cofactor I) is a natural anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and other serine proteases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873" href="/z/d/graphic/90873.html" rel="external">

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Hereditary AT deficiency is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Several acquired conditions may lower AT levels, but the clinical significance of this finding is often limited. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology'

         <strong>
          Prevalence
         </strong>
         – Hereditary AT deficiency is infrequent, both overall and among inherited thrombophilias. The estimated general population prevalence is approximately 0.02 to 0.2 percent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108016" href="/z/d/graphic/108016.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The prevalence in individuals with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is approximately 1 to 7 percent. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical findings
         </strong>
         – Hereditary AT deficiency confers a greater risk of thrombosis than other hereditary thrombophilias. Some individuals never have a VTE; others may have life-threatening VTE as a child, young adult, or with a first pregnancy. Other individuals may come to medical attention because of kidney disease or heparin resistance. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – We do not test for AT deficiency in most patients with VTE. We may test individuals with a positive family history, thrombosis in childhood or early adulthood, heparin resistance, asparaginase therapy, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. When testing is done, plasma AT activity (also called AT-heparin cofactor assay) is the best first test. Testing is best performed when the patient has recovered from an acute VTE and is not receiving an anticoagulant. Plasma AT activity below the normal range (typically &lt;80 percent) is consistent with AT deficiency. The differential diagnosis includes other inherited and acquired thrombophilias. (See
         <a class="local">

          Anticoagulation
         </strong>
         – Therapeutic anticoagulation is appropriate for individuals with hereditary AT deficiency who have a VTE  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107766" href="/z/d/graphic/107766.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

          AT concentrate

          Pregnancy

         – If an individual with hereditary AT deficiency develops a VTE during pregnancy, therapeutic dose anticoagulation is generally used with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin. (See

          History of VTE
         </strong>
         – If an individual with a personal history of thrombosis or compelling family history (multiple individuals with thrombosis, individual with unprovoked thrombosis), we suggest administering AT concentrate just prior to and at delivery when anticoagulation cannot be administered (

         <strong>
          ECMO, dialysis, heparin resistance

         – Individuals with AT deficiency undergoing ECMO or hemodialysis, or those with heparin resistance, may benefit from AT replacement along with anticoagulation. (See

          First-degree relatives
         </strong>
         – Hereditary AT deficiency is autosomal dominant. First-degree relatives of an affected individual have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the variant. Testing first-degree relatives is appropriate if the family history is positive for VTE, especially if multiple family members are affected or if VTE occurred at an early age. (See
