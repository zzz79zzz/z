Depending on the most prominent symptom and the baseline medication regimen, a variety of pharmacologic strategies can be used to manage motor complications.</p><p>Device-assisted and surgical treatments are also available to improve motor function in selected patients with advanced typical PD and motor fluctuations, whose condition cannot be further improved by medical therapy. These treatments (deep brain stimulation [DBS], focused ultrasound therapy [FUS], continuous levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel [LCIG] infusion, and continuous subcutaneous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9374" href="/z/d/drug information/9374.html" rel="external">apomorphine</a> infusion [CSAI]) are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4897.html" rel="external">"Device-assisted and lesioning procedures for Parkinson disease"</a>.)</p><p>Initial pharmacologic treatment of PD, management of nonmotor symptoms, and other aspects of advanced PD are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4896.html" rel="external">"Initial pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4900.html" rel="external">"Management of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4899.html" rel="external">"Nonpharmacologic management of Parkinson disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97581.html" rel="external">"Palliative approach to Parkinson disease and parkinsonian disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2834328323"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Motor fluctuations</strong> – As PD progresses and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons degenerate, presynaptic neurons lose their ability to store and release levodopa after enzymatic conversion to dopamine. As a result, the response to standard levodopa immediate-release formulations begins to mirror its short half-life (approximately 90 minutes). Such rapid-cycling kinetics and pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors by dopamine may contribute to the narrowing of the therapeutic window over time. In addition, levodopa levels are highly dependent on intestinal absorption, which can be impaired by poor gastric emptying, slow intestinal transit times, competing dietary protein, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dyskinesia</strong> – Dyskinesia is an overexpression of movement caused by dopamine receptor hypersensitivity to dopamine and a relative excess of dopamine levels. Dyskinesia in patients with PD is often attributed to levodopa therapy and is thus referred to as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). However, any agent that stimulates or enhances the effect of dopamine at the receptor (eg, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase type B [MAO B] inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyl transferase [COMT] inhibitors) may trigger dyskinesia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although the relationship between levodopa and dyskinesia is generally dose-dependent, the dyskinesia threshold in any individual with PD is highly variable. In other words, dyskinesia can occur at relatively low therapeutic doses of levodopa (eg, 100 mg levodopa per dose) in some patients. Dyskinesia also tends to be more common in patients with young-onset PD (ie, before the age of 50 years) and less prominent and disabling in patients with later-onset disease (&gt;80 years of age).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors for motor complications</strong> – A variety of factors have been associated with earlier and more severe motor complications in patients with PD. These include younger age at disease onset, longer disease duration, more severe nonmotor symptoms (eg, anxiety and depression), levodopa dose and responsiveness, and overall disease severity [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Although much attention has been given to levodopa’s role in the development of motor complications, levodopa-sparing strategies are not believed to affect the natural history and can cause undue harm by depriving patients of the beneficial effects of levodopa on motor function and quality of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4896.html" rel="external">"Initial pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease", section on 'When should drug therapy be started?'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H869236874"><span class="h1">SYMPTOM SPECTRUM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Motor complications are not uncommon in early PD, occurring in up to 30 to 40 percent of patients during the first five years of treatment. As PD advances, the majority of patients (60 percent or more by 10 years) experience some form of complication of therapy [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>].</p><p>When levodopa therapy is first initiated in early or mild PD, patients typically experience a smooth and prolonged response to the medication and do not appreciate the onset of action ("kick-in") or "wearing off" of each dose. However, as the disease advances, the effect of a dose of levodopa may begin to wear off as quickly as three to four hours. The term "motor complications" refers to several phenomena that mark the shift from a physiologic steady-state level of dopamine release to reliance on exogenous levodopa and its short duration response.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Motor fluctuations </strong>– Motor fluctuations are alterations in function caused by a positive or therapeutic response to dopaminergic therapy ("on") alternating with a declining or absent response to dopaminergic therapy ("off"). Types of motor fluctuations include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>"<strong>Wearing off</strong>" is characterized by the reemergence of parkinsonian symptoms as the effect of levodopa diminishes near the end of the dose interval, usually three to four hours after a dose. "Wearing off" is often the first and most commonly encountered fluctuation in patients with PD. (See <a class="local">'Approach to "wearing off"'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Unpredictable "off"</strong> periods (also referred to as "on-off") are sudden alterations in function without obvious relationship to levodopa or dopaminergic therapy dosing. (See <a class="local">'Unpredictable "off" periods'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Failure of the "on" response</strong> includes failure to transition from an "off" parkinsonian state to an "on" response following a dose of levodopa. (See <a class="local">'Failure of "on" response'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Freezing of gait (FOG)</strong> refers to episodic inability to step and advance in any direction, usually occurring during initiation, turns, or when encountering transition points in the environment. FOG can occur with or without dopaminergic therapy and may be independent of other motor fluctuations. It is a signature and disabling symptom of the "off" state. (See <a class="local">'Freezing of gait'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute akinesia</strong> refers to a sudden and severe exacerbation of PD including an akinetic state that lasts for several days and does not respond to treatment with antiparkinson medication. It is differentiated from typical dose-dependent "off" periods. (See <a class="local">'Acute akinesia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nonmotor features of PD have the potential to fluctuate concurrently, especially feelings of panic or confusion, and may be even more disabling than the motor features. Management of nonmotor features of PD is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4900.html" rel="external">"Management of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dyskinesia</strong> – Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) refers to abnormal, involuntary movements brought on by use of levodopa. Other dopaminergic medications are less likely to lead to dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, but some, such as the dopamine agonists, may exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. LID encompasses a variety of involuntary movements or postures, including chorea, dystonia, athetosis, ballism, and myoclonus [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], which emerge at various times in relation to levodopa dosing:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Peak-dose dyskinesia</strong> appears when the patient is "on" and is often choreiform in nature. Peak-dose dyskinesia usually starts 30 to 90 minutes after a dose of levodopa. (See <a class="local">'Approach to peak-dose dyskinesia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diphasic dyskinesia</strong> is a rare form of dyskinesia leading to two separate periods of involuntary movement after a levodopa dose, the first occurring when patients turn "on" and the second when they begin to wear "off." ”Wearing off” dyskinesia are less common and are sometimes characterized by large-amplitude leg movements. (See <a class="local">'Diphasic dyskinesia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>"Wearing off" dystonia</strong> manifests as involuntary muscle spasm often involving the limbs but sometimes involving the face, neck, or trunk, during "off" periods. Symptoms are most often reported early in the morning, before a dose of levodopa. (See <a class="local">'Dystonia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H950431518"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be evaluated for levodopa response and adverse effects at each visit in an effort to optimize response and quality of life. Visits also provide an opportunity to review terminology and improve the ability of patients to recognize and report motor complications.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History and observation </strong>–<strong> </strong>In assessing patient history, it is important to differentiate between tremor and dyskinesia when a patient uses the term "shaking." Time of examination in relation to last levodopa dose should be noted and documented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinicians should inquire whether the patient takes levodopa on a fixed schedule (by the clock) or when needed (ie, when experiencing "wearing off"). Since meals and dietary protein can interfere with the absorption of levodopa in the intestine, clinicians should pay close attention to when and what the patient eats in relation to the response to levodopa dosing [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Review of home videos can be very useful for complicated and mixed patterns of fluctuations, since direct observation for prolonged periods in the clinic is often not possible. Properly timed telehealth visits may conceivably be used to capture different states of function. More often, "on," "off," and dyskinetic states are identified in separate visits in most general practices.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Movement disorder neurologists may perform scheduled "off-on" testing, particularly when evaluating a patient for advanced or invasive therapies or during clinical research assessments. A patient who can come to the office safely and tolerate the "off" state for assessment may hold a morning dose of levodopa. Evaluation of the "on" examination can then be accomplished as early as 30 to 60 minutes after the dose is administered.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptom diaries</strong> – Symptom diaries, including video recordings, may be helpful but can be unreliable if the patient is unfamiliar with definitions of dyskinesia, tremor, dystonia, and "on" versus "off" states. Careful education, re-education, and practice are necessary so that diaries are as accurate and informative as possible [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reasons for subspecialty referral</strong> – In general, referral to a movement disorder specialist is warranted for medically refractory patients who experience troublesome motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in order to optimize medical therapy or to discuss advanced or invasive therapies [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO "WEARING OFF"</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of strategies can help to mitigate "wearing off," and management requires an individualized, trial-and-error approach.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3545389843"><span class="h2">Dietary adjustments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The absorption of levodopa in the duodenum and its transport across the blood-brain barrier are facilitated by a large neutral amino acid transporter. Ingested protein has the potential to compete with levodopa transport in the gut and brain, thereby reducing levodopa's clinical benefit [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Patients should be made aware of these potential interactions, and effects of diet should be examined in patients who have motor fluctuations. Patients who report that protein-rich meals impair the levodopa benefit or "on" response should avoid protein at the time of drug administration and/or take the medication on an empty stomach, 30 to 60 minutes before or 60 to 90 minutes after a meal.</p><p>Further efforts to reduce or redistribute the amount of consumed protein are sometimes essential, particularly in patients with complex fluctuations such as dose failures and unpredictable "off" periods. A protein redistribution diet (PRD), in which most dietary protein intake is reserved for the evening, has demonstrated some benefit in small studies [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. However, levodopa-related side effects, inconvenience, and poor adherence limit long-term use [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], and many patients find this type of diet impractical. Nonetheless, a protein redistribution diet is worth trying in select patients (see <a class="local">'Unpredictable "off" periods'</a> below and <a class="local">'Failure of "on" response'</a> below). Consultation with a nutritionist is recommended when there are concerns about adequate caloric intake or nutritional needs.</p><p>Beyond dietary adjustments, additional strategies to improve gastrointestinal absorption remain exploratory and await further confirmation in larger clinical trials [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. For example, preliminary studies suggest that eradication of <em>Helicobacter </em>colonization, which is present in approximately half of the population, may be a useful method for improving levodopa absorption and reducing motor fluctuations in patients with PD [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. In addition, limited data suggest that the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is higher among patients with PD compared with controls, and that SIBO may interfere with levodopa absorption and contribute to motor fluctuations [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Levodopa dose and interval adjustment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who are on a low dose of levodopa and are not experiencing side effects, "wearing off" can be managed initially by increasing the dose of levodopa [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, this strategy can be counterproductive when the individual levodopa dose is high (ie, &gt;200 mg) and may amplify dyskinesia and "off" dystonia.</p><p>For more advanced PD when peak-dose dyskinesia becomes problematic, shortening the dosing interval while administering lower doses (ie, smaller but more frequent doses, sometimes called levodopa dose fractionation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]) is a common strategy. This strategy may require additional levodopa doses at the end of the day, especially if the patient is planning activities later in the evening. Sometimes lower doses fail to reach a therapeutic threshold necessary to turn the patient "on," resulting in more dose failures and an increase in "off" time.</p><p>Dose fractionation can usually be accomplished with standard tablet doses of levodopa. Liquifying <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8994" href="/z/d/drug information/8994.html" rel="external">carbidopa-levodopa</a> may be considered for patients who have difficulty titrating tablet doses. However, this approach is not practical since carbidopa-levodopa is insoluble in water and no commercial preparation of liquid carbidopa-levodopa is available. Instructions for preparation of a daily supply of liquid carbidopa-levodopa are available, but use of this method is generally not recommended unless supervised by a clinical pharmacologist and movement disorder neurologist familiar with this technique [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Occasional patients with advanced PD exhibit a "brittle" response pattern or an "all or none" response. In this situation, an individual dose may produce no evident clinical response, and slightly higher doses trigger an exaggerated response with dyskinesia. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood and is more complex than just a progressive narrowing of therapeutic window between response and dyskinesia [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3888506355"><span class="h2">Role of longer-acting oral levodopa formulations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two longer-acting oral levodopa formulations exist: an older, controlled-release (CR) tablet and a newer, extended-release (ER) capsule. Each has unique characteristics and limitations that inform use in selected patients in various stages of PD.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CR tablets</strong> – In general, CR tablets are useful as a form of levodopa in early PD, when patients are typically free of motor complications and experience a smooth and prolonged response to levodopa. Patients who desire twice-per-day dosing for convenience purposes can be switched from immediate-release (IR) to CR tablets, although the difference between twice-daily and three-times-daily dosing may not be seen as an important advantage by patients. Their use in this context does not offer any long-term advantage in terms of motor fluctuations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4896.html" rel="external">"Initial pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease", section on 'Initial dosing and titration'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The role of the CR tablet in managing motor fluctuations is more limited and is generally reserved for bedtime use to reduce middle-of-the-night or early-morning "wearing off." Daytime use is complicated by the unpredictable onset of levodopa action and sometimes delayed responses, which can exacerbate motor fluctuations and promote delayed dyskinesia. Although an early study suggested that CR <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8994" href="/z/d/drug information/8994.html" rel="external">carbidopa-levodopa</a> tablets were useful in the early stages of the "wearing off" phenomenon and could add up to 90 additional minutes throughout the day to levodopa's effectiveness [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], the overall evidence is inconsistent [<a href="#rid23">23-26</a>]. Two systematic reviews have concluded that CR tablets do not reliably decrease "off" time compared with IR levodopa formulations [<a href="#rid19">19,27</a>]. In addition, the CR tablet is less well absorbed than the IR tablet and takes longer to "kick in"; thus, an individual dose increase of approximately 30 percent may be required to achieve an equivalent clinical response.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ER capsules</strong> – The ER capsule formulation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8994" href="/z/d/drug information/8994.html" rel="external">carbidopa-levodopa</a> (Rytary in the United States, Numient in Europe) may be helpful for patients experiencing motor fluctuations with standard tablet forms of levodopa despite dose/interval adjustments and use of adjunctive dopaminergic medications. In this setting, ER capsules can be used to replace daytime IR and CR tablets. Converting IR/CR tablets to ER capsules is sometimes difficult and should be accomplished gradually, using the conversion table provided by the manufacturer. In practice, ER capsules can lead to a reduced number of daily doses and potential reduction in motor fluctuations, but at a higher cost, with a similar or higher pill burden and twofold higher daily mg dose of levodopa. Bedtime use of ER capsules to replace CR tablets is also an option to reduce middle-of-the-night or early morning "wearing off."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The ER capsule contains IR and ER beads of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8994" href="/z/d/drug information/8994.html" rel="external">carbidopa-levodopa</a> that are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract at different rates. Unlike CR tablets, ER capsules can be opened and the beads sprinkled on a small amount of applesauce to ease administration for patients who have difficulty swallowing pills.

Avoiding protein at the time of drug administration and taking levodopa on an empty stomach (30 to 60 minutes before a meal or 60 to 90 minutes after) can reduce competition from protein at the gut-blood and blood-brain barrier level. In the author's experience, it is not uncommon to find that patients and caregivers underestimate the amount of protein in certain foods such as nutrition bars and shakes. Querying for larger sources of protein in a patient's diet may uncover hidden protein loads. A protein redistribution diet, in which most dietary protein intake is reserved for the evening, is a safe and reasonable intervention to consider.

In addition, "off" periods affecting upper and lower body function should be differentiated from episodes of freezing of gait (FOG), which may occur in "on" and "off" states and are often refractory to levodopa.

It is crucial to determine when and how FOG relates to the timing of levodopa doses, as treatment strategies and prognosis vary.</p><p>Levodopa-responsive FOG occurs during end-of-dose "off" periods and usually responds to shortening levodopa dose intervals or increasing the levodopa dose to avoid "off" episodes. Judicious use of any adjunctive medication can be considered, but there is very little evidence to support the use of any one drug class to alleviate FOG. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be an option when "off"-associated FOG occurs in the context of other DBS-responsive motor fluctuations. (See <a class="local">'Levodopa dose and interval adjustment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Device-assisted and surgical therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>Freezing occurring in the "on" state is by definition poorly responsive to dopaminergic therapy and just as refractory to surgical and device-assisted therapies. However, if it occurs at peak levodopa effect, reducing the dose of a dopamine agonist, if being used, followed by reducing the levodopa dose, if necessary, is worth trying. The downside of this strategy is a possible compromise of the levodopa response of other motor symptoms. Fortunately, FOG in the "on" state is uncommon, accounting for only 5 percent of cases of FOG, and is usually shorter in duration than levodopa-responsive FOG.</p><p>The mainstay of the management of severe FOG includes physical therapy and management of treatable comorbidities [<a href="#rid90">90,91</a>]. Trials of targeted neurologic and PD-focused physical therapy (PT) have shown some evidence of benefit [<a href="#rid92">92</a>], and a physical therapist experienced with patients with PD can help to identify specific strategies to avoid FOG. Movement strategies or cues that may help the patient "get into gear" include shifting weight, making wider turns, concentrating on taking larger steps forward, or using visual imagery as if to step over an obstacle. A regular cane or special laser cane may also be helpful for FOG [<a href="#rid93">93</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132685.html" rel="external">"Patient perspective: Parkinson disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H869237432"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptom spectrum</strong> – Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) who take levodopa chronically are increasingly likely to develop motor fluctuations and dyskinesia as the disease progresses and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons degenerate and lose presynaptic dopamine storage capacity. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods marked by a positive response to medication ("on"), and periods marked by reemergence of parkinsonian symptoms ("off"). Dyskinesia consists of various types of abnormal involuntary movements, most often choreiform, which are brought on by levodopa or other dopaminergic agents. (See <a class="local">'Symptom spectrum'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to "wearing off"</strong> – "Wearing off" near the end of the levodopa dose interval is often the first and most commonly encountered motor fluctuation. An individualized, trial-and-error approach to "wearing off" may include any or all of the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dietary adjustments</strong> – Patients who report that protein-rich meals impair the levodopa benefit should avoid protein at the time of drug administration and/or take levodopa on an empty stomach. Efforts to reduce or redistribute the amount of consumed protein are sometimes essential, particularly in patients with complex fluctuations, including delayed or "no-on" responses and unpredictable "off" periods. (See <a class="local">'Dietary adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Levodopa adjustments</strong> – For most patients who experience "wearing off" on a low dose of levodopa (eg, ≤200 mg per dose), we suggest increasing the dose of levodopa (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For those who do not tolerate higher doses of levodopa due to dyskinesia or who experience "wearing off" at higher doses, we suggest reducing the dose interval (with smaller individual doses of levodopa) and adding additional doses at the end of the day, as needed (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Levodopa dose and interval adjustment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients with morning "wearing off" on immediate-release (IR) levodopa, a bedtime dose of the controlled-release (CR) tablet formulation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8994" href="/z/d/drug information/8994.html" rel="external">carbidopa-levodopa</a> may be helpful. However, daytime use of CR tablets may exacerbate motor fluctuations and can lead to delayed-onset dyskinesia. Carbidopa-levodopa extended-release (ER) capsules show promise in reducing motor complications, but more widespread use is limited by cost and difficulties of converting from levodopa tablets to ER capsules. (See <a class="local">'Role of longer-acting oral levodopa formulations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Adjunctive therapy</strong> – If levodopa adjustments for "wearing off" are not adequate or tolerated, we suggest addition of a dopamine agonist, a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, or a monoamine oxidase type B (MAO B) inhibitor (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). All have similar effects, and selection of a specific drug should be individualized. The main limiting factor to adjunctive medications is worsened dyskinesia and nonmotor dopaminergic side effects (eg, orthostasis, impulse control disorders). (See <a class="local">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Rescue therapy</strong> – Subcutaneous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9374" href="/z/d/drug information/9374.html" rel="external">apomorphine</a> injections are an option for patients with sudden and unpredictable "off" periods despite best efforts to optimize dopaminergic therapy. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120011" href="/z/d/drug information/120011.html" rel="external">Inhaled levodopa</a> and sublingual apomorphine may be alternative rescue strategies for patients who do not desire injections. (See <a class="local">'On-demand rescue strategies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to peak-dose dyskinesia</strong> – Peak-dose dyskinesia can occur in any patient with PD if the levodopa dose is high enough and is a common counter-effect of strategies to treat "wearing off" and other motor fluctuations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Early in the course of PD, troublesome peak-dose dyskinesia can be managed by lowering the levodopa dose, shortening the interdose interval (ie, more frequent, lower individual doses) if associated with "wearing off," and switching to a longer-acting formulation of levodopa (beware slower onset of benefit and late-day dyskinesia with CR tablets). (See <a class="local">'Reduction in levodopa or adjunctive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with troublesome dyskinesia despite medication adjustments, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8508" href="/z/d/drug information/8508.html" rel="external">amantadine</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Both IR and ER formulations of amantadine are available and appear to have similar effects. With required monitoring, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9289" href="/z/d/drug information/9289.html" rel="external">clozapine</a> can be considered in patients with refractory dyskinesia and psychosis. (See <a class="local">'Amantadine for dyskinesia'</a> above and <a class="local">'Role of clozapine'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complex motor complications</strong> – Management of unpredictable "off" periods, freezing of gait (FOG), dose failures, dystonia, and diphasic dyskinesia is individualized and typically includes a combination of the above strategies. (See <a class="local">'Troubleshooting complex motor complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute akinesia should prompt a search for systemic infection or other intercurrent medical problems that are capable of causing a sudden worsening of parkinsonism. (See <a class="local">'Acute akinesia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who fail oral and transdermal medical therapies for motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, options include deep brain stimulation (DBS), continuous levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion delivered through a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube by battery-powered pump, and continuous subcutaneous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9374" href="/z/d/drug information/9374.html" rel="external">apomorphine</a> infusion (CSAI) administered by a battery-powered pump.
