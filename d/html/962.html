This was subsequently termed Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, although earlier isolated case reports describing similar patients had been published. In 1943, the ECG features of preexcitation were correlated with anatomic evidence for the existence of anomalous bundles of conducting tissue that bypassed all or part of the normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction system.</p><p>This topic will discuss the definitions, anatomy, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of WPW syndrome as well as the approach to risk stratification of asymptomatic patients. The treatment options for patients with tachyarrhythmias and WPW syndrome are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8470587"><span class="h2">Normal AV conduction versus accessory AV pathway conduction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the normal heart, the atria and the ventricles are electrically isolated, with conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles normally occurring via the AV node and the His-Purkinje system. Patients with a preexcitation syndrome have an additional pathway, known as an accessory pathway (also called bundle of Kent), which directly connects the atria and ventricles, thereby allowing electrical activity to bypass the AV node, leading to "preexcitation" or earlier than usual activation of the His-Purkinje system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53343" href="/z/d/graphic/53343.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Tissue in the accessory pathways, which are congenital in origin and result from failure of resorption of the myocardial syncytium at the annulus fibrosis of the AV valves during fetal development, typically conducts electrical impulses more quickly than the AV node, resulting in the shorter PR interval seen on the surface ECG. (See <a class="local">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1000.html" rel="external">"Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome and enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1001.html" rel="external">"Atriofascicular ("Mahaim") pathway tachycardia"</a>.)</p><p>It has been estimated that most accessory pathways (60 to 75 percent) are capable of bidirectional conduction (antegrade and retrograde) between the atrium and ventricle. However, some accessory pathways (17 to 37 percent) are only capable of conduction in a retrograde fashion from ventricle to atrium [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. When accessory pathways conduct exclusively in the retrograde direction (so-called "concealed" accessory pathways), they do not generate a delta wave (ie, slurred upstroke of the QRS complex) and the WPW pattern on the surface ECG but are still capable of supporting reentrant tachycardia. Retrograde conduction can occur following ventricular pacing or premature beats, and it can form the retrograde arm of an orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) circuit. The vast majority of concealed accessory pathways are left-sided [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> below and <a class="local">'Anatomy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/976.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway", section on 'Narrow complex AVRT'</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly (5 to 27 percent), an accessory pathway is only capable of conduction in the antegrade direction; in such cases, the ECG does show a delta wave and the WPW pattern on the surface ECG, and the pathway can form the antegrade arm of an antidromic AVRT circuit. The mechanism responsible for unidirectional conduction along an accessory pathway (antegrade only or retrograde only) remains undetermined. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/976.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway", section on 'Wide complex AVRT'</a>.)</p><p>Accessory pathways that appear to be concealed may be capable of antegrade conduction in some situations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If AV nodal conduction is enhanced and/or the accessory pathway is left lateral (ie, far from the sinus node), conduction may proceed over the normal AV node-His Purkinje system more quickly than over the accessory pathway. In these cases, antegrade accessory pathway conduction occurs, but is not manifest on the surface ECG. Transient blockade of AV nodal conduction with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9359" href="/z/d/drug information/9359.html" rel="external">adenosine</a> may expose the "concealed" pathway.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In some patients with left free wall accessory pathways, pacing the left atrium via the coronary sinus, in an area closer to the accessory pathway, may be necessary to bring out antegrade accessory pathway conduction and overt preexcitation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some accessory pathways (in any location) may have limited antegrade conduction potential due to a long refractory period and only become manifest at slower heart rates.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13260536"><span class="h2">WPW pattern versus WPW syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two terms, distinguished by the presence or absence of arrhythmias, have been used to describe patients with AV accessory pathways:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The WPW pattern is applied to the patient with preexcitation manifest on an ECG in the absence of symptomatic arrhythmias.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>WPW syndrome is applied to the patient with both preexcitation manifest on an ECG and symptomatic arrhythmias involving the accessory pathway.</p><p></p><p>Persons with either the WPW pattern or WPW syndrome can have identical findings on the surface ECG. In either situation, antegrade conduction through the accessory pathway results in earlier activation, or preexcitation, of part of the ventricles. The classic WPW ECG pattern  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75578" href="/z/d/graphic/75578.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76226" href="/z/d/graphic/76226.html" rel="external">waveform 2</a>) has two major features: a shortened PR interval and a widened QRS complex due to a delta wave. The ECG findings are discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13260635"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8470594"><span class="h2">Accessory pathway location</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Electrophysiologic studies and mapping have shown that accessory AV pathways may be located anywhere along the AV ring (groove) or in the septum. The most frequent locations are left lateral (50 percent), posteroseptal (30 percent), right anteroseptal (10 percent), and right lateral (10 percent). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/953.html" rel="external">"Anatomy, pathophysiology, and localization of accessory pathways in the preexcitation syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>Many studies have attempted to correlate the site of the accessory pathway with the ECG pattern [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>]. However, the ECG appearance of activation depends upon the extent of preexcitation and, as a result, the same pathway may not always produce the same ECG pattern. Furthermore, up to 13 percent of individuals with preexcitation have more than one accessory pathway [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The probability is increased in subjects with a family history of preexcitation, as well in as patients with Ebstein malformation of the tricuspid valve and certain forms of cardiomyopathy [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Familial WPW'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Associated cardiac abnormalities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with AV accessory pathways do not have coexisting structural cardiac abnormalities [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Associated congenital heart disease, when present, is more likely to be right-sided than left-sided in location [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Ebstein anomaly is the congenital lesion most strongly associated with WPW syndrome. As many as 10 to 20 percent of such patients have one or more accessory pathways; the majority of these are located in the right free wall and right posteroseptal spaces [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8146.html" rel="external">"Ebstein anomaly: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>An association between mitral valve prolapse and left-sided accessory pathways has also been reported. However, this association may simply reflect the random coexistence of two relatively common conditions [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p>In addition, a familial form of WPW syndrome is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). (See <a class="local">'Familial WPW'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When discussing the prevalence of WPW, it is important to distinguish between the WPW pattern (ie, ECG abnormalities in asymptomatic patients) and WPW syndrome. Both are fairly infrequent, occurring in less than 1 percent of the general population, with the WPW pattern between 10 and 100 times more common than WPW syndrome.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Prevalence of WPW pattern</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of a WPW pattern on the surface ECG is estimated at 0.13 to 0.25 percent in the general population [<a href="#rid11">11,19,20</a>]. The prevalence appears higher (up to 0.55 percent) among first-degree relatives of persons with the WPW pattern, suggesting a familial component. (See <a class="local">'Familial WPW'</a> below.)</p><p>The WPW pattern on the ECG may be intermittent and may even disappear permanently over time [<a href="#rid19">19,21-24</a>]. In several large cohorts, the frequency of intermittent preexcitation appears to range between 10 and 40 percent [<a href="#rid21">21,23,24</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one cohort study, 22 percent of individuals who eventually manifested the WPW pattern on an ECG initially had a normal tracing, and in 40 percent of these patients, the WPW pattern disappeared on subsequent ECGs [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a cohort of 328 patients with preexcitation (mean age 13 years), 41 patients (13 percent) were noted to have intermittent preexcitation [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a single-center cohort of 295 patients with preexcitation (mean age 12 years at presentation), 39 patients (13 percent) had intermittent preexcitation, and another 30 (10 percent) had loss of preexcitation on ambulatory monitoring or exercise testing [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p>Intermittent and/or persistent loss of preexcitation may indicate that the accessory pathway has a relatively longer baseline refractory period, which makes it more susceptible to age-related degenerative changes and variations in autonomic tone [<a href="#rid21">21,22,25</a>]. Compared with patients with a persistent WPW pattern, those in whom antegrade conduction via the accessory pathway disappeared were older (50 versus 39 years) and had a longer refractory period of the accessory pathway at initial electrophysiologic study ([EPS]; 414 versus 295 milliseconds) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with WPW pattern'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Prevalence of WPW syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of WPW syndrome is substantially lower than that of the WPW pattern alone. The exact value has varied in different studies, depending in part upon the duration of follow-up:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a review of 22,500 healthy aviation personnel, the WPW pattern on an ECG was seen in 0.25 percent, and only 1.8 percent of these patients had documented arrhythmia [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a report of 228 subjects with the WPW pattern by ECG who were followed for 22 years, the overall incidence of arrhythmia resulting in WPW syndrome was 1 percent per year [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 432,166 children, ages 6 to 20 years, the prevalence of WPW syndrome was 0.07 percent [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p>Different types of supraventricular arrhythmias occur in WPW syndrome.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT): up to 80 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF): 15 to 30 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atrial flutter: 5 percent or less</p><p></p><p>The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in asymptomatic persons is quite low, with a meta-analysis of 20 studies (1869 patients), estimating the risk at 0.13 percent per year [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>The occurrence of arrhythmia is related to the age at the time preexcitation was discovered [<a href="#rid21">21,30</a>]. In one cohort study of 113 persons with the WPW pattern, one-third of asymptomatic individuals less than 40 years of age at the time the WPW pattern was identified eventually had symptomatic arrhythmias, compared with none of those who were 40 years of age or older at diagnosis [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>As noted above, the WPW pattern may disappear in asymptomatic patients; a similar course can occur in patients with WPW syndrome [<a href="#rid19">19,21,22</a>]. In one cohort of 113 patients with WPW syndrome or AV nodal reentrant tachycardia who were followed for nine years, 23 percent lost antegrade conduction and ventricular preexcitation, 8 percent lost retrograde conduction in the accessory pathway, and 10 percent had disappearance of their arrhythmias [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Prevalence of WPW pattern'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20061242"><span class="h2">Prevalence of concealed accessory pathways</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The true prevalence of concealed accessory pathways is unknown. Since the presence of a concealed accessory pathway is only identified during an arrhythmia (eg, AVRT), such a pathway cannot be identified during sinus rhythm using an ECG alone. Thus, only patients with symptomatic arrhythmias who undergo diagnostic EPS ever have concealed accessory pathways diagnosed. Among patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) presenting for catheter ablation, the prevalence of concealed accessory pathways is approximately 15 percent [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Familial WPW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients with WPW syndrome, 3.4 percent have first-degree relatives with a preexcitation syndrome [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. A familial form of WPW syndrome has infrequently been reported and is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait [<a href="#rid10">10,36,37</a>]. Two studies of three families with affected subjects who had an early onset of conduction disease and frequent episodes of AF mapped the gene responsible for WPW syndrome to chromosome 7q34-q36 [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Missense mutations were identified in the PRKAG2 gene, which encodes the gamma-2 regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>].</p><p>An inherited form of WPW syndrome associated with familial HCM has been described and may be due to either mutations in the PRKAG2 gene, as with isolated familial WPW syndrome, or in the LAMP2 gene, which is responsible for glycogen storage disease IIb (Danon disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing", section on 'PRKAG2 and LAMP2 genes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29400384"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, the majority of patients with the WPW pattern on their ECG remains asymptomatic. However, a small percentage of patients with the WPW pattern develop arrhythmias (eg, AV reentrant [or reciprocating] tachycardia [AVRT], atrial fibrillation [AF] with rapid ventricular response, etc) as a part of WPW syndrome. Most patients who develop an arrhythmia will present with one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpitations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lightheadedness and/or dizziness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syncope or presyncope</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sudden cardiac arrest</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8470608"><span class="h2">Arrhythmias associated with WPW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tachycardias associated with WPW syndrome can be classified into those in which the accessory pathway is necessary for initiation and maintenance of the tachycardia, and those in which the bypass tract acts as a "bystander," providing a route of conduction from the anatomic site of tachycardia origin to other regions of the heart  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82249" href="/z/d/graphic/82249.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29400309"><span class="h3">Tachycardias requiring an accessory pathway for initiation and maintenance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AVRT is a reentrant tachycardia with an anatomically defined circuit that consists of two distinct pathways, the normal AV conduction system and an AV accessory pathway, linked by common proximal (the atria) and distal (the ventricles) tissues. If sufficient differences in conduction time and refractoriness exist between the normal conduction system and the bypass tract, a properly timed premature impulse can initiate reentry. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/954.html" rel="external">"Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias"</a>.)</p><p>The two major forms of this type of arrhythmia in WPW syndrome are orthodromic AVRT (ie, antegrade conduction via the AV node and retrograde conduction via the accessory pathway) and antidromic AVRT (ie, antegrade conduction via the accessory pathway and retrograde conduction via the AV node).

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Individuals with this condition have a short PR interval and a widened QRS complex on their ECG and paroxysmal tachycardia. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Manifest versus concealed pathways</strong> – Most accessory pathways are capable of antegrade conduction (exhibiting either antegrade conduction alone or bidirectional conduction) from atrium to ventricle and thus manifest as WPW pattern. However, some accessory pathways conduct only in a retrograde fashion from ventricle to atrium. When there is no antegrade conduction through the accessory pathway (ie, no preexcitation), the characteristic WPW ECG pattern is absent, and the pathway is described as "concealed." (See <a class="local">'Normal AV conduction versus accessory AV pathway conduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomy</strong> – The accessory pathway may be located anywhere along the AV ring (groove) or in the septum. The most frequent locations are left lateral (50 percent), posteroseptal (30 percent), right anteroseptal (10 percent), and right lateral (10 percent). Up to 13 percent of individuals with preexcitation have more than one accessory pathway. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> – The prevalence of a WPW pattern on the surface ECG is estimated at 0.13 to 0.25 percent in the general population. The WPW pattern on the ECG may be intermittent and may even disappear permanently over time, depending on the conduction properties of the accessory pathway. The prevalence of WPW syndrome (the WPW pattern plus tachyarrhythmia) is substantially lower than that of the WPW pattern alone, perhaps as low as 2 percent of patients with the WPW pattern on the surface ECG. (See <a class="local">'Prevalence of WPW pattern'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prevalence of WPW syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ECG features</strong> – The classic ECG pattern of preexcitation in sinus rhythm is characterized by a fusion between conduction via the accessory pathway and the normal AV node/His-Purkinje system, resulting in the following ECG characteristics (see <a class="local">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The PR interval is short (less than 0.12 seconds) due to rapid AV conduction through the accessory pathway and bypass of the AV node.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The initial part of ventricular activation is slowed, and the upstroke of the QRS complex is slurred because of slow muscle-fiber-to-muscle-fiber conduction; this is termed a <strong>delta wave.</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The QRS complex is widened and consists of fusion between early ventricular activation caused by preexcitation with the later ventricular activation resulting from transmission through the AV node and the infranodal conduction system to the ventricles.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>WPW pattern versus syndrome</strong> – The majority of patients with the WPW pattern on their ECG remain asymptomatic, although a small percentage of patients with the WPW pattern develop arrhythmias as a part of WPW syndrome. Most patients who develop an arrhythmia will present with palpitations, with syncope or SCD occurring much less frequently. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tachycardias</strong> – Tachycardias associated with WPW syndrome can be classified into those in which the accessory pathway is necessary for initiation and maintenance of the tachycardia, and those in which the bypass tract acts as a "bystander," providing a route of conduction from the anatomic site of tachycardia origin to other regions of the heart (see <a class="local">'Arrhythmias associated with WPW'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>AV reentrant (or reciprocating) tachycardia (AVRT)</strong> – This is a reentrant tachycardia with an anatomically defined circuit that consists of two distinct pathways, the normal AV conduction system, and an AV accessory pathway, linked by common proximal (the atria) and distal (the ventricles) tissues. The two major forms of AVRT are orthodromic and antidromic AVRT, defined by the direction of conduction through the AV node and the accessory pathway. (See <a class="local">'Tachycardias requiring an accessory pathway for initiation and maintenance'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/976.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Atrial fibrillation (AF)</strong> – This arrhythmia occurs in 10 to 30 percent of persons with WPW syndrome, somewhat higher than might be expected given the low prevalence of coexisting structural heart disease. When atrial impulses are transmitted along the accessory pathway in AF, ventricular rates may exceed 300 beats per minute and can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF). (See <a class="local">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Ventricular fibrillation</strong> – In most cases, VF occurring in patients with WPW syndrome results from the rapid ventricular response during AF that has persisted and ultimately deteriorated into VF. Although the frequency with which AF with rapid AV conduction via an accessory pathway degenerates into VF is unknown, the incidence of sudden death in patients with WPW syndrome is quite low. (See <a class="local">'Ventricular fibrillation and sudden death'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of the WPW pattern can nearly always be made by reviewing the surface ECG. In addition, in some rare circumstances invasive electrophysiology testing can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of an accessory pathway. WPW syndrome is diagnosed following the development of an arrhythmia in a patient with a preexisting WPW pattern on an ECG. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The ECG findings in persons with the WPW pattern can be similar to ECG findings seen in other cardiac conditions, including prior myocardial infarction, ventricular premature beats, idioventricular rhythm, and bundle branch block. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis of ECG findings'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk stratification for asymptomatic patients</strong> – Our approach to risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with the WPW pattern is as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119379" href="/z/d/graphic/119379.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Approach to risk stratification'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Initial noninvasive evaluation, including a resting 12-lead ECG in everyone and, unless there is intermittent preexcitation at rest, an exercise ECG test in all patients who are able to exercise on a treadmill. If patients are unable to exercise, ambulatory ECG monitoring and/or sodium channel blocker challenge are additional noninvasive risk stratification options. The observation of an abrupt and unambiguous loss of preexcitation at faster heart rates is generally considered a sufficient sign that the accessory pathway has limited antegrade conduction potential and the patient is considered "low-risk" for life-threatening ventricular rates.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If preexcitation persists at maximum heart rates during exercise testing, or is persistent during the entire period of ambulatory monitoring or sodium channel blocker challenge, it does not necessarily mean that the patient is "high-risk," but rather that the risk cannot be determined by noninvasive means. A decision to proceed to electrophysiology study in these indeterminate cases for better resolution of accessory pathway profile must be made on a case-by-case basis with careful discussion between clinician and patient. (See <a class="local">'Risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with WPW pattern'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome", section on 'Asymptomatic patients'</a>.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Wolff L, Parkinson J, White PD.
