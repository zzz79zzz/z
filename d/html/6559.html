However, a small number of infants with apparently minor blunt head trauma may have a clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) that requires extended observation or acute intervention such as intensive supportive care or neurosurgery. Neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) is highly sensitive for identifying brain injury that requires intervention; however, it exposes patients to radiation. By performing a complete history and physical and utilizing a clinical decision rule, the clinician can identify those infants at higher risk for traumatic brain injury (TBI) while minimizing overuse of CT.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Minor blunt head trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Experts define minor blunt head trauma in infants and children younger than two years of age as a history of, or physical signs of, blunt trauma to the head in an infant or child who is alert or awakens to voice or light touch (ie, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 14 to 15) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Minor head trauma is generally defined separately in infants and children younger than two years of age for the following reasons [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical assessment is more difficult</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infants with intracranial injuries are frequently asymptomatic</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skull fractures or clinically important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBIs) may occur despite minor trauma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abusive head trauma occurs more frequently in infants</p><p></p><p>The clinician should regard these patients as having <strong>apparently</strong> minor head trauma because approximately 5 percent have traumatic brain injury (TBI) on neuroimaging, and 1 percent have ciTBI that requires prolonged observation/monitoring or acute intervention such as intensive supportive care and/or neurosurgery.

Short-term follow-up (four weeks post-injury) indicates that the risk of morbidity or mortality in young children with TBI is very low. However, because there are no long-term studies of infants and children with TBI on CT who do not meet criteria for ciTBI, the long-term implications of these findings are unknown. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4005991174"><span class="h2">Mild traumatic brain injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define mild TBI as an acute TBI that is associated with one or more of the following signs or symptoms [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confusion or disorientation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Post-traumatic amnesia for &lt;24 hours</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of consciousness (LOC) for ≤30 minutes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transient neurologic abnormalities such as seizures and focal neurologic signs or symptoms</p><p></p><p><strong>and</strong></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>GCS score 13 to 15  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) at 30 minutes or longer after their injury</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that children younger than two years were not specifically addressed, and several of the signs and symptoms noted are not assessable in this age group due to their developmental stage. Additionally, this definition covers a broad range of patients with highly variable risk for TBI requiring intensive supportive care and/or neurosurgery (ciTBI). For example, the rate of abnormalities on CT in patients with a GCS score of 13 is as high as 20 percent [<a href="#rid4">4,9,10</a>]. By contrast, patients with minor symptoms and a GCS score of 15 have less than 1 percent incidence of ciTBI [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2163963"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathophysiology of subdural hematomas, epidural hematomas, and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infants and children are discussed in detail separately. Of note, young infants with open fontanels may develop intracranial hypertension and its associated signs later in the course of a growing hematoma because the intracranial space can expand. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6520.html" rel="external">"Intracranial subdural hematoma in children: Epidemiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6566.html" rel="external">"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children: Initial evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Head trauma occurs commonly in infants and young children with approximate annual rates of 1620 emergency department visits, 45 hospitalizations, and 4 deaths per 100,000 population in the United States [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The vast majority of injuries are due to falls (followed by motor vehicle collisions and pedestrian/bicycle accidents); however, it is important to note that abusive head trauma occurs most frequently in infants younger than two years. Accidental injuries typically cause minor and isolated head trauma in the majority of patients [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For infants younger than two years with minor blunt head trauma and a normal neurologic examination, approximately 3 to 10 percent have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) on CT, 1 percent have clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI), and 0.2 percent require neurosurgical intervention [<a href="#rid3">3,4,13-16</a>]. Some infants with TBI have no clinical symptoms of brain injury, although most of these patients have nonfrontal scalp hematomas [<a href="#rid3">3,17,18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p>Many clinicians regard infants with ventricular shunts or bleeding disorders as having a higher risk for ciTBI after minor head trauma. Two large cohort studies suggest that this risk is not substantially different from normal infants [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. However, these studies had low numbers of infants younger than two years of age. Thus, until further evidence is available, a more cautious approach to imaging in these patients may still be warranted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89479938"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25136725"><span class="h2">Common findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observational studies have identified altered mental status, loss of consciousness (LOC), abnormal behavior per caregiver, scalp hematoma, and vomiting as common features associated with minor head trauma in infants evaluated in emergency departments [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2261944655"><span class="h3">Altered mental status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Altered mental status, defined in one large cohort study as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score &lt;15, agitation, lethargy, or not acting normally per the caregiver, has been reported in over 10 percent of infants with minor head trauma presenting for emergency department evaluation and is strongly associated with clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H469050458"><span class="h3">Loss of consciousness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>LOC following minor head trauma is reported in 4 to 5 percent of infants &lt;2 years of age undergoing emergency evaluation [<a href="#rid3">3,23</a>]. LOC may be associated with ciTBI depending upon its duration and the presence of other clinical predictors [<a href="#rid3">3,5,23</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Isolated LOC</strong> – For this discussion, isolated LOC refers to LOC without any of the age-related Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) clinical predictors for ciTBI such as severe mechanism of injury, altered mental status, vomiting, headache, or signs of skull fracture  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477" href="/d/graphic/58477.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). In such infants, the risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the setting of brief, isolated LOC is low. For example, in one multicenter, prospective cohort study of over 150 infants with isolated LOC after mild head trauma, 0.6 percent had ciTBI and 2.2 percent had TBI noted on CT (any intracranial injury or depressed skull fracture) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Longer duration of LOC was not associated with an increased risk although the sample size was small. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>LOC and at least one additional predictor</strong> – The presence of one additional PECARN clinical predictor in patients with LOC markedly increases the change of ciTBI. In the study described above, of almost 350 infants with LOC and at least one additional clinical predictor, 5 percent had ciTBI and 9 percent had TBI on CT [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. For these patients, longer duration appears to be associated with ciTBI although most patients in this analysis were two years of age or older. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H537332234"><span class="h3">Abnormal behavior</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the prospective PECARN study, which included over 10,500 infants &lt;2 years of age with minor blunt head trauma, abnormal behavior was reported by the routine caregiver in nearly 4 percent of infants; ciTBI occurred in 0.2 percent of these patients [<a href="#rid3">3,24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H469050465"><span class="h3">Scalp hematoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Scalp hematomas are an important indicator of potential TBI, especially when they appear in younger infants (eg, &lt;6 months of age), are larger (eg, &gt;3 cm), and are located in the temporal, parietal, or occipital regions [<a href="#rid25">25-28</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter observational study of nearly 3000 children younger than two years of age with an isolated scalp hematoma (no other signs or symptoms of TBI), 50 of 570 children (9 percent) who underwent CT had TBI (eg, subdural or epidural hematomas, cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages, or cerebral contusion). Of over 100 patients younger than three months with any scalp hematoma who underwent CT, 21 percent had TBI on CT, confirming that an isolated scalp hematoma is an important indicator of potential brain injury in neonates and young infants. However, ciTBI occurred in only 12 patients (0.4 percent of all patients), <strong>none</strong> of whom died or required neurosurgery [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The infant scalp score, a previously validated clinical score, incorporates age and hematoma characteristics and may help stratify the risk of TBI in young infants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93136" href="/d/graphic/93136.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid26">26,29</a>] (see <a class="local">'Isolated scalp hematoma'</a> below). The mechanism of injury is also an important consideration <strong>not</strong> addressed in this score. (See <a class="local">'Approach'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3587555060"><span class="h3">Vomiting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At least one episode of vomiting occurs in approximately 15 percent of infants undergoing emergency evaluation following minor head trauma [<a href="#rid3">3,30</a>]. Because vomiting is a potential sign of increased intracranial pressure in infants, we regard it as a potential sign of TBI that may warrant observation after a minor head injury, especially if associated with other clinical predictors. However, isolated vomiting after minor blunt head trauma in infants is not a predictor of ciTBI and TBI as discussed separately [<a href="#rid3">3,4,30,31</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127071.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in children (≥2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Vomiting'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25136731"><span class="h2">Seizures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Post-traumatic seizures appear to be associated with a significant risk of TBI and ciTBI after minor blunt head trauma. For example, in a planned secondary analysis of the PECARN head trauma study cohort, of the 332 infants and children with posttraumatic seizures who presented with a GCS score of 15 and underwent a head CT, 20 patients (6 percent) had TBI on CT (eg, any intracranial injury hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, cerebral edema, depressed skull fracture of at least the width of the skull, or traumatic skull diastasis) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>], 19 of whom had other clinical predictors of ciTBI. Of these 20 patients, 10 (3 percent) met criteria for ciTBI (hospitalized for ≥2 days or required neurosurgery); four of these patients were &lt;2 years of age. The frequency of TBI was higher for patients with a lower GCS, longer seizure duration, and longer interval since the traumatic event. Data specifically for children younger than two years were not reported, except that none of the 21 who had a GCS of 15 and no other PECARN criteria for ciTBI had TBI on CT (0 percent, 95% CI 0-16). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127071.html" rel="external">"Minor blunt head trauma in children (≥2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Seizures'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25136738"><span class="h2">Skull fractures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skull fractures occur in up to 10 percent of infants following minor head trauma [<a href="#rid27">27,33,34</a>]. Most skull fractures in this population are linear. Among children with linear skull fractures, 15 to 30 percent have associated intracranial injuries [<a href="#rid2">2,15,18,35-37</a>], and the risk of ciTBI is &gt;4 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In infants younger than one year of age, large scalp hematoma size, younger age, and/or nonfrontal location (highest risk with temporal or parietal), suggest a higher incidence of skull fracture (see <a class="local">'Scalp hematoma'</a> above). By contrast, in one prospective series of 422 children, no infant with a frontal hematoma had an intracranial injury [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1">The evaluation and management of skull fractures in children are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6563.html" rel="external">"Skull fractures in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Features of the history and physical examination, along with selective neuroimaging, generally identify infants who have sustained a brain injury with acute management implications. The priority for the evaluation of infants with apparently minor head trauma is to identify those patients with clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) while limiting unnecessary neuroimaging. </p><p>In infants with minor blunt head trauma, clinical findings can help stratify a patient's risk of ciTBI as high, intermediate, or low, with implications for the need for neuroimaging. Focused evaluation to support these clinical decisions can be facilitated by clinical practice guidelines and implementation of computerized decision support based upon validated clinical prediction rules such as the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) traumatic brain injury (TBI) rules  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477" href="/d/graphic/58477.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid38">38-42</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Of great importance is that infants who may have sustained child abuse must be identified, and clinical prediction rules have not been shown to be adequately sensitive [<a href="#rid43">43</a>] nor were they intended to be used for identifying child abuse.

Most children with minor head trauma do not need CT to exclude ciTBI. The decision to obtain a head CT must balance the importance of identifying a significant but uncommon ciTBI with the estimated risks of late-onset malignancy associated with radiation exposure from CT. Although only a very small number of patients with ciTBI require neurosurgery, the risk of missing such an injury is immediate and potentially considerable. The risks of radiation-related malignancy are real; however, they are very low and over the lifetime of the child [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>].

The goal of these decision rules is to identify infants and children who are at low risk for ciTBI and do <strong>not</strong> need neuroimaging. In prospective validation, the sensitivity for detection of ciTBI in infants &lt;2 years was 100 percent (95% CI 86-100 percent), and the negative predictive value was also 100 percent (95% CI 99.7-100 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The prevalence of ciTBI was approximately 1 percent in both the derivation and validation cohorts. In addition to deriving and validating the clinical rules to identify children at low risk for ciTBI, these results support grouping of children with minor head trauma into three risk categories to inform CT decision-making and provide guidance for children who are not at low risk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128099" href="/d/graphic/128099.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See <a class="local">'Patient populations'</a> below.) </p><p>Subsequently, the PECARN rule has shown high accuracy for determining the risk of ciTBI and maintained consistency in both prospective and retrospective validation studies in a variety of settings [<a href="#rid43">43,53-56,58,59</a>]. For example, in a prospective, multicenter study from Australia and New Zealand among the over 4000 infants and young children &lt;2 years old, the rate of ciTBI for each risk group was: high risk 8.5 percent (95% CI 6-11.6 percent), intermediate risk 0.2 percent (95% CI 0.0-0.6 percent), and low risk 0 percent (95% CI 0.0-0.2 percent) [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. </p><p>Of note, because there have been no long-term studies of patients with TBI on CT who did not require prolonged observation or intervention, the importance of this injury (and need for its identification) is unclear.</p><p>Successful implementation of the PECARN rules have been described using a variety of methods, including clinician education, clinical pathways, and clinical decision support embedded in the electronic health record [<a href="#rid38">38,40,60-63</a>]. Implementation has generally resulted in high clinician satisfaction, high adherence to the rule, and either a decrease or no significant change to the rate of neuroimaging (primarily head CT), depending upon the baseline imaging rate [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>In one large prospective study that compared the PECARN rules with two other decision rules (the children's head injury algorithm for the prediction of important clinical events [CHALICE] and Canadian assessment of tomography for childhood head injury [CATCH], which are described below), the PECARN rules had the highest sensitivity and identified all patients with ciTBI while the other rules misclassified some patients with ciTBI as low risk, including one patient that required neurosurgery [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Depending upon the setting and how they are implemented, the PECARN rules are also associated with safe but variable decreases in the use of neuroimaging (ie, CT) [<a href="#rid9">9,38</a>]. In addition, cost-effectiveness analysis has found that the use of the PECARN rules, when compared with usual care in settings with a 33 percent baseline rate of CT utilization for minor blunt head trauma, was more beneficial in terms of quality-adjusted life-years lost and cost savings [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Comparison of the PECARN decision rules with physician clinical judgment is provided below. (See <a class="local">'Clinical judgment'</a> below.) </p><p>Several other clinical decision rules for children with minor head trauma have been derived [<a href="#rid22">22,66</a>]. Of these, CHALICE  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91922" href="/d/graphic/91922.html" rel="external">table 6</a>) and CATCH  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91921" href="/d/graphic/91921.html" rel="external">table 7</a>) were derived in large, heterogeneous cohorts. Of note is that neither clinical decision rule addresses children younger than two years separately: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CHALICE rule</strong> – Unlike PECARN, which sought to identify children at low risk who would not require imaging, the CHALICE rule, derived from a prospective study of 22,772 patients, identified 14 high-risk criteria for ciTBI  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91922" href="/d/graphic/91922.html" rel="external">table 6</a>) that serve as indicators for head CT. During derivation, the rule had a sensitivity of 98 percent (95% CI 96-100 percent) and a specificity of 87 percent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, evidence suggests that the CHALICE rule may increase the rate of head CT without improved detection of ciTBI as well as misclassify patients with ciTBI as being low risk [<a href="#rid64">64,67</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The CHALICE rule has been implemented in the United Kingdom [<a href="#rid68">68</a>], and other investigators have suggested use of the CHALICE rule instead of the PECARN rules. For example, in two separate analyses, investigators determined, based upon theoretical estimates, that implementation of the PECARN rule would increase the amount of neuroimaging to a greater extent than the CHALICE rule [<a href="#rid22">22,66</a>]. However, as noted above, actual implementation of the PECARN rule in a variety of different emergency departments resulted in decreases or no significant change in rates of neuroimaging [<a href="#rid9">9,38</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a decision analysis that compared the CHALICE and PECARN rules and assigned costs based upon the United Kingdom National Health Service experience, CHALICE was the optimal strategy for evaluating children with minor head trauma [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. However, all decision rules evaluated in this study had similar costs and outcomes. Specifically, the PECARN rule achieved quality-of-life estimates similar to the CHALICE rule while costing about ₤75 (approximately $125 USD) more per patient. This difference in cost is likely within the margin of error for the model.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CATCH rule</strong> – The CATCH rule consists of four high-risk factors and three additional medium-risk factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91921" href="/d/graphic/91921.html" rel="external">table 7</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. During derivation in almost 4000 children, including those with a GCS score of 13, it achieved high sensitivity (98 percent for intermediate-risk factors and 100 percent for high-risk factors). However, it would require that 52 percent of patients undergo CT. Subsequently, CATCH-2, which adds vomiting ≥4 episodes to the seven original risk factors validated for CATCH, has achieved higher sensitivity for detecting patients with brain injury and patients requiring neurosurgical intervention but still requires high rates of neuroimaging (&gt;50 percent) and has not been validated [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the PECARN rule has better discrimination for ciTBI in infants with minor blunt head trauma than the CATCH rule while not increasing the baseline rate of neuroimaging [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3013249712"><span class="h4">Clinical judgment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence suggests that clinical decision rules improve the detection of ciTBI in infants with minor blunt head trauma compared with clinical judgment alone. For example, in a planned secondary analysis of almost 8500 children from the validation group of the original PECARN study [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], the PECARN rules had higher sensitivity than clinician judgment (100 versus 60 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. The PECARN rules had lower specificity than clinical judgment (54 versus 92 percent), which has caused some concern that use of these rules could theoretically cause an increase in rates of neuroimaging. However, implementation of the PECARN rules in a variety of settings, including those with a low baseline rate of neuroimaging, has not increased subsequent utilization of neuroimaging for infants with minor blunt head trauma [<a href="#rid9">9,38,40,60</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Clinical decision rules'</a> above.)</p><p>In settings where clinician judgment is already documented to be highly accurate (eg, pediatric emergency medicine attendings practicing in high-volume tertiary care pediatric facilities), implementation of the PECARN decision rules may have limited impact on improving detection of ciTBI. For example, in a prospective, single-center observational study that compared physician judgment with clinical decision rules, both clinical judgment and the PECARN rules identified all ciTBIs, including four patients requiring neurosurgical intervention (sensitivity 100 percent, 95% CI 84-100 percent for both) [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. However, in this study, all physicians were aware of the published PECARN rules and had to document the PECARN predictors for all included patients. Thus, it is likely that the PECARN rules indirectly impacted clinical judgment [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Furthermore, since this was a single-center study, it may not be generalizable to other settings, especially those with a low volume of pediatric patients or those not staffed by pediatric emergency medicine specialists. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1688715498"><span class="h3">Patient populations</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1283766126"><span class="h4">High risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend that infants and children younger than two years of age with a high risk for ciTBI according to the PECARN or other clinical decision rules undergo neuroimaging.

Among high-risk patients, ciTBI was noted in 1.2 percent of the observed group compared with 9.4 percent of patients with no planned observation.

If abuse is not a concern, skull radiography is of no added value if a head CT is performed, especially if three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull is part of the CT study.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1313063046"><span class="h2">Other markers of brain injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other potential markers for TBI include blood S100B protein and skull radiographs:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biomarker detection (S100B protein)</strong> — S100B protein is a calcium-binding protein located in glial cells that is released into the bloodstream after trauma.

However, a small number of infants with apparently minor injuries may have a clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) that requires extended observation or acute intervention such as intensive supportive care or neurosurgery. (See <a class="local">'Rationale'</a> above and <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> – For infants &lt;2 years of age with minor head trauma and a normal neurologic examination, approximately 3 to 10 percent have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) on CT of the head, 1 percent have ciTBI, and 0.2 percent require neurosurgical intervention. Many patients with ciTBI appear well and may only have nonfrontal hematomas. Infants younger than three months are of particular concern. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The clinician should perform a thorough history and physical examination in infants with minor blunt head trauma with specific attention to clinical findings that should raise concern for ciTBI. In this age group, the clinician should be attentive to any concerning historical or exam features indicative of abuse  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119441" href="/d/graphic/119441.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>PECARN clinical decision rules</strong> – Infants &lt;2 years of age with minor blunt head trauma and no suspicion for child abuse can be stratified as high, intermediate, or low risk for ciTBI based on clinical features. We suggest that evaluation decisions, especially the performance of neuroimaging and observation, be guided by the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) low-risk clinical decision rules  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477" href="/d/graphic/58477.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) rather than other rules. Clinical decision rules are intended to assist with rather than completely direct approach to management. (See <a class="local">'Clinical decision rules'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical judgment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Isolated scalp hematoma</strong> – For otherwise well-appearing infants &lt;1 year of age whose only criterion for ciTBI or TBI after minor blunt head trauma is an isolated scalp hematoma, we suggest that clinicians use the infant scalp score  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef93136" href="/d/graphic/93136.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) in addition to the PECARN head injury decision rules to stratify risk and determine the need for neuroimaging. (See <a class="local">'Isolated scalp hematoma'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Approach to neuroimaging</strong> – The approach to neuroimaging for infants and children younger than two years of age with minor blunt head trauma based upon clinical findings is provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128099" href="/d/graphic/128099.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). Patients at high risk for ciTBI should undergo prompt neuroimaging. Those at intermediate risk may undergo neuroimaging or observation based on the specific clinical scenario, with performance of imaging if persistent, worsening, or new symptoms occur during observation. Individuals at low risk for ciTBI should not undergo neuroimaging. (See <a class="local">'Approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">This approach does <strong>not</strong> apply to infants and children for whom there is clinical concern for abusive head trauma. All such patients warrant neuroimaging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Recommended study</strong> – Both unenhanced CT of the head and MRI of the brain have the necessary sensitivity to identify ciTBI. Head CT can be rapidly obtained in most hospitals. Although MRI has no associated radiation, it is less available in most settings, which can result in delays in care and may require use of sedation due to longer scanning times. (See <a class="local">'Recommended study'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Specific management recommendations based on results of the evaluation are addressed separately.
