         A 57-year-old hospital administrator who has had type 1 diabetes for 15 years is trying very hard to improve her glycemic control. She does not "count" carbohydrates (does not estimate her carbohydrate intake or use an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) and does not use an insulin sensitivity factor for correction doses. Instead, she adjusts her insulin dose, her food intake, and exercise pattern in response to how she feels. Her work hours vary, and she frequently needs to attend business lunches and dinners.

         When a person continually adjusts insulin doses using an approach that is not consistent and also varies food intake and exercise routines, it is difficult to identify glycemic patterns. In this setting, keeping a three-day record of food intake, insulin doses, and exercise can be helpful in understanding the basis for the wide glycemic excursions (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60634" href="/z/d/graphic/60634.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). As can be seen, the woman's total carbohydrate intake and its distribution are markedly different each day. This variability prevents the attainment of glycemic control with a fixed-dose insulin regimen. In general, the use of fixed doses of preprandial short-acting insulin in a person who does not eat the same amount of food or eat at the same times each day does not work well.
        </p>
        <p>
         A consultation with a registered dietitian or diabetes educator to learn carbohydrate counting (usually more realistic than trying to eat a similar amount of carbohydrates from day to day) can be helpful. She should be taught to calculate her mealtime insulin dose using an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and to use an insulin sensitivity (correction) factor to supplement the pre-breakfast and pre-dinner insulin dose. She should not use the same correction factor for the pre-lunch insulin dose, as a lesser amount of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">
          regular insulin
         </a>
         is needed since NPH insulin given in the morning has its greatest glucose-lowering effect in the late morning and early afternoon. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1765.html" rel="external">
          "Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Advanced carbohydrate counting'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If her insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio is 1:15 (ie, she needs 1 unit of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">
          regular insulin
         </a>
         to cover 15 g of carbohydrate) and she eats 90 g of carbohydrate for breakfast, she would take 6 units of regular insulin. If she eats only 30 g of carbohydrates one morning, she would take 2 units of regular insulin.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If her correction factor is 30 (1 unit lowers glucose concentration by 30 mg/dL [1.7 mmol/L]), she then adjusts the pre-breakfast or pre-dinner insulin based upon her pre-meal glucose and her target glucose. If the target glucose is 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) and the pre-meal glucose is 210 mg/dL, she would give herself an extra 3 units of "correction" insulin (subtract 120 mg/dL from the pre-meal glucose and divide by 30 to calculate the correction insulin).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The timing of the administration of the
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">
          regular insulin
         </a>
         in relation to the meal is also important. Due to the relatively slow absorption of regular insulin (compared with the rapid-acting insulin analogs), it is best taken 30 to 45 minutes before eating. Given her busy and unpredictable schedule, including the challenge of testing her blood glucose and administering her pre-meal dose 30 to 45 minutes before meals, she may prefer a rapid-acting insulin analog, which can be taken immediately before the meal to allow her greater flexibility in her variable lifestyle. The rapid-acting analogs also have a shorter duration of action than regular insulin and may reduce the occurrence of hypoglycemia before the next meal. However, if hypoglycemia in the late morning persists, changing from NPH insulin to a basal insulin with a longer, flatter insulin profile may be helpful. If NPH insulin is continued and late morning hypoglycemia persists, a mid-morning snack will be needed, but this may be difficult for her to do at work and can contribute to unwanted weight gain.
        </p>
        <p>
         If she cannot or is unwilling to learn to use an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, the registered dietitian can assist her in developing a carbohydrate-consistent diet (approximately the same amount of carbohydrate for each breakfast, for each lunch, and for each dinner). Based on the agreed upon carbohydrate content of each meal, a fixed dose of insulin can be used, and an algorithm can be provided that incorporates a correction dose for elevated glucose readings. In addition, providing instructions for increasing

          regular insulin
         </a>
         for high carbohydrate meals (eg, pizza), reducing regular insulin for the meal preceding exercise, and/or eating a carbohydrate snack before and/or during exercise is important.

         After examining the available blood glucose readings (

        <p>
         You suggest that the hyperglycemia can be improved by increasing the dose of

          insulin aspart

         before her brunch and evening meal. It is also prudent to consider some other aspects of her lifestyle. As an example, she may be snacking after dinner, including close to bedtime. Furthermore, the evening meal may be her biggest and most variable meal of the day. It would therefore be helpful for her to learn carbohydrate counting and to use an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio when calculating her mealtime insulin aspart doses (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1765.html" rel="external">
          "Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Advanced carbohydrate counting'

         ). Exercise in the afternoon may also be lowering her late afternoon glucose levels.
        </p>

         Her lowest glucose reading before dinner was 72 mg/dL. Overnight, her glucose readings fell to 80 mg/dL (after being hyperglycemic at bedtime). In addition to needing more

         The increasing difficulty in maintaining glycemic control in this patient with recent-onset diabetes is probably due in part to a progressive decline in endogenous insulin secretion. In addition, his insulin regimen is not ideal, as he is taking too little
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">
          regular insulin
         </a>
         , and he is taking NPH insulin too early in the evening. As an example, his high blood glucose values at 1:30 PM suggest that he needs to take regular insulin before lunch.
        </p>
        <p>
         The triad of reasonable blood glucose values before bedtime, very high fasting values before breakfast, and a history of tiredness and early morning headache suggest a problem with the NPH insulin dose that he is taking before his evening meal. The action of the NPH insulin may be maximal in the late evening and middle of the night (causing both normoglycemia at bedtime and
         <strong>
          nocturnal hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         ) and then dissipating in the early morning (causing
         <strong>
          hyperglycemia
         </strong>
         before breakfast). The presence of nocturnal hypoglycemia followed by early morning hyperglycemia (or hypoglycemia) can be confirmed by measuring blood glucose at 3 AM or by using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).
        </p>
        <p>
         One solution is to move his evening dose of NPH insulin from before the evening meal to before bedtime. In addition, both of his NPH insulin doses are likely to be too high. When using NPH insulin at night, a bedtime snack may be needed to prevent hypoglycemia during the night. When using NPH and regular insulins in the morning, a mid-morning snack may be needed. These snacks can contribute to weight gain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another approach would be to switch from NPH insulin to a basal insulin with a longer, flatter profile (such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9023" href="/z/d/drug information/9023.html" rel="external">
          insulin glargine
         </a>
         or degludec), and to change from
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">
          regular insulin
         </a>
         to a rapid-acting insulin analog to control mealtime glycemic excursions and to use for correction of hyperglycemia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1796.html" rel="external">
          "Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Multiple daily injections'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A review of his exercise patterns in the evening may also be helpful. Vigorous evening exercise makes it more likely that his blood glucose concentration will fall to low values during the night. (See

To reduce his A1C value further (goal is below 7 percent), he should be taught carbohydrate counting so that he can use an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. If this is not possible, a pre-meal insulin algorithm should be provided. The use of CGM may also be helpful. (See

         A 19-year-old college freshman has had type 1 diabetes since age 9. His A1C in his senior year of high school was 7.5 percent, but the most recent one was 9.4 percent. He is taking a full course load, is getting decent grades, and is involved in lots of intramural sports, drama, and campus politics. He takes 32 units of insulin U-100 glargine in the morning, plus 4 to 8 units of lispro insulin before his meals. He is frustrated with his blood glucose values, which are shown in the table (

         Despite testing his blood glucose at least five times daily, there is no discernable pattern. In this situation, it is important to take a more detailed history of exactly what his day-to-day life is like and exactly how and where he is giving his insulin injections. Some days he is up at 7 AM, and on other days he does not get up until 1 PM. The timing of his "morning" dose of

          insulin glargine
         </a>
         therefore varies by six hours from day to day. He has been rotating his glargine and lispro shots from his arm, leg, buttock, or abdomen just like he was told to do when he was first diagnosed at age 9. One day he went for a three-hour bike ride just after giving his morning glargine insulin in his thigh. He was severely hypoglycemic two hours into the ride. He sometimes forgets to check his blood glucose or take his lispro before he eats so then takes a dose of lispro immediately after the meal based on how much carbohydrate he thinks he just ate. He then checks his blood glucose one to two hours later and gives himself a "correction dose" of lispro at that time if his blood glucose is too high.
        </p>

         Unpredictable blood glucose patterns commonly indicate variability in eating, exercise, timing of insulin administration, and/or physical or emotional stress. You can attempt to help the patient reduce sources of variability:

         Although she could slowly increase her NPH insulin dose before the evening meal, this would be dangerous since this is the insulin that is working during the night, and the two 3 AM values are in the normal/low normal range. Increasing her evening NPH insulin dose will increase the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia. This risk can be reduced by having her take her evening dose of NPH insulin at bedtime, instead of before the evening meal, and increasing the dose in small increments while continuing to measure blood glucose both at 3 AM and before breakfast.

However, she may be in danger of hypoglycemia before lunch once her before-breakfast glucose values are lowered as recommended above. It might therefore be wise to slightly decrease her morning regular insulin dose as the bedtime NPH insulin dose is increased.

         – Her before evening meal blood glucose values are too low, with an average value of 78 mg/dL (4.3 mmol/L) and three hypoglycemic episodes during the week. These findings suggest that she may be taking too much NPH insulin before breakfast, since this is the insulin that is acting during the afternoon. Other possible explanations might be that she goes to the gym in the afternoon, her lunch is too early or too light, or that she does not eat an adequate mid-afternoon snack. Since she does not want to eat more because she does not want to gain weight, reducing her morning NPH insulin dose is recommended. Alternatively, as suggested above, changing her basal insulin preparation or switching to insulin pump therapy could be considered.

This suggests that some variable aspect of her lifestyle is creating the fluctuations in the bedtime glucose values. Possible problems include variation in the time or content of her evening meal or snacks, or in evening exercise. As an example, the blood glucose value of 301 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) before bedtime on day 2 may have resulted from dietary overcompensation for her hypoglycemic episode before the evening meal.

         A 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes since age 20 has been using an insulin pump for the past 19 years. His basal rate is 1.15 units/hour from 6 AM to 2 AM and 1.5 units/hour from 2 AM to 6 AM. He uses an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1:7.5 for breakfast and lunch and 1:7 for dinner. His insulin sensitivity factor (correction factor) is 45. After beginning a hybrid closed-loop system (hybrid artificial pancreas) in the automatic ("Auto") mode, his glucose readings are as shown in the figure in period "B" (

         During period "B," he consistently is hyperglycemic after lunch whereas evening readings are variable (

          figure 3
         </a>
         ). He is advised to change his insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio to 1:7 (from 1:7.5) for lunch, resulting in slightly more insulin coverage, and he reviewed his carbohydrate counting skills with a registered dietitian. In addition, he should take mealtime insulin boluses before he starts to eat the meal. When using Auto mode, if the mealtime bolus is taken after starting to eat (after the glucose levels start to rise), the automatic feature will give more basal insulin in response to the rising glucose concentrations, resulting in more insulin on board and a higher risk of hypoglycemia after the meal.
        </p>
        <p>
         After making these changes, his time in range improved from 56 to 72 percent (period "A" in the figure) (

         at bedtime is too much for him. The blood glucose values before lunch are ideal, but they are too high before dinner and even higher before bedtime. This suggests that insulin detemir is not lasting 24 hours.

She would benefit from splitting her glargine dose to twice daily. She was reluctant to change her insulin regimen due to her fear of nocturnal hypoglycemia, but she agreed to change her insulin glargine to 18 units each morning and 12 units each evening. These changes were agreed upon using shared decision-making. She was also encouraged to take more
