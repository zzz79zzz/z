         Patients with heart failure (HF) are at increased risk for major adverse cardiac events with noncardiac surgery. Patients with or without a prior diagnosis of HF may decompensate with acute HF perioperatively. (See
         <a class="local">

         HF is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of one or more current or prior symptoms (such as dyspnea, fatigue, or edema) caused by cardiac dysfunction. This definition of HF includes patients with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stages C and D HF and excludes patients in stages A (at risk for HF but without structural heart disease) or B (at risk for HF with structural heart disease)  (

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of perioperative HF includes preoperative evaluation and risk assessment, decision-making regarding whether and when to proceed with surgery, and pre-, intra-, and postoperative management [

         HF is one of the most common conditions requiring evaluation and treatment in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Aging populations and progress in the treatment of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease (CAD) are increasing the prevalence of HF [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In addition, older adult patients at risk for HF are likely to undergo noncardiac surgery. It is estimated that HF is present in almost 20 percent of older adults undergoing common surgical procedures in the United States [
         <a href="#rid5">

         HF is a major risk factor for adverse cardiac events, including death following noncardiac surgery [

         In the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), a history of HF is associated with an increased risk of major perioperative complications (adjusted odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-8.8) [
         <a href="#rid7">

         In a study of 97,129 patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, patients with HF were older, had more comorbidities, and had higher mortality (adjusted risk ratio 1.79, 95% CI 1.50-2.14) compared with those without HF [

         In an analysis that included 23,340 patients with HF and 28,710 patients with CAD who underwent major noncardiac surgery, the risk-adjusted operative mortality (death before discharge or within 30 days of surgery) was 11.7 percent for patients with HF, 6.6 percent for patients with CAD, and 6.2 percent for control patients [

         A population-based analysis of four cohorts with a total of 38,047 consecutive patients showed that the 30-day postoperative mortality rate following major or minor procedures was significantly higher in patients with nonischemic HF (9.3 percent), ischemic HF (9.2 percent), and atrial fibrillation (6.4 percent) than in those with CAD (2.9 percent) [

         The initial step in preoperative evaluation is an assessment of symptoms and signs of HF, functional status, conditions associated with risk of acute decompensated HF, and conditions associated with risk of developing HF. (See

         Symptoms and signs of HF include exertional dyspnea, fluid retention, and fatigue. In older adults who have decreased mobility, the usual symptoms of early or advanced HF may not manifest in a typical manner. In patients who have symptoms of HF, careful physical examination and, in some cases, testing are required to differentiate HF from other causes of dyspnea such as obesity, deconditioning, and lung disease.

         Conditions and triggers associated with HF and other major adverse cardiac perioperative events (including death) include age, myocardial ischemia, hypertension, coexistent severe valve dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, kidney disease (especially end-stage kidney disease), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, anemia, and diabetes mellitus [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. A priori knowledge of these triggers of HF may influence clinicians to institute certain interventions early in the perioperative period, such as postoperative dialysis, optimal pain control to avoid hypertension, and the preoperative use of beta blockers or antiarrhythmic medications to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation.

A rationale for assessing LV function is that LVEF impacts management (as treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] differs from treatment for HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) and lower LVEF is associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

For these patients, risk indices derived from studies of patients undergoing elective surgery are not accurate, though they may provide an estimate of the lower bounds of risk. The increased risk associated with more urgent surgery is likely related to the decreasing amount of time available for preoperative assessment and management. The 2014 perioperative guidelines included the following definitions [

         In patients with HF, the decision to proceed with surgery is influenced by the urgency of surgery (emergency, urgent, or elective), severity of HF, presence of comorbid conditions, and the risks specific to the proposed surgery. Decision making in this setting involves a multidisciplinary team approach that typically includes a primary care clinician, cardiologist, surgeon, and anesthesiologist (see

         For patients with an indication for emergency surgery, options for preoperative clinical assessment and management are limited. Since emergency surgery must generally be performed within six hours to save life or limb (avoid mortality or significant morbidity), clinical risk assessment is closely followed by decision-making with the patient and patient’s family regarding whether to proceed with surgery or palliation. Patients with altered hemodynamics (including those with new or decompensated HF) that cannot be corrected before surgery may benefit from invasive hemodynamic monitoring [

         When patients with symptomatic HF require emergency (or urgent) high-risk surgery, we suggest that physicians who are proficient in the care of advanced HF be involved in the management of these patients perioperatively. In this setting, there is limited time for patient evaluation, and skilled interpretation of available information is needed to optimize perioperative management.

Patients with symptomatic HF prior to surgery should receive medical therapy to optimize their clinical status. There is little evidence on how to manage HF in the preoperative period. Given the paucity of evidence, one should take a similar approach to that used for the general management of HF [

          ARNI, ACE inhibitor, or ARB

         – For patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), treatment with an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or single-agent angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is common (see

However, since established benefits are from chronic use, temporary discontinuation is acceptable when there is risk of excessive hypotension (eg, related to intravascular volume depletion or medications such as anesthetics). In an effort to reduce the risk of intraoperative hypotension, one potential option is to give the last preoperative dose of ARNI, ACE inhibitor, or ARB on the evening prior to the day of surgery (and not on the morning of surgery) [

         For patients with chronic HFrEF who have not been receiving a beta blocker, initiation of beta blockade immediately preoperatively should generally be avoided given risk of harm (including stroke and death). Since the beneficial effects of beta blockade can take weeks or months, beta blockade should not be initiated in the preoperative period in patients with LV systolic dysfunction unless surgery can be substantially delayed (eg, at least two to four weeks). Rapid preoperative titration of beta blockade would not be expected to be beneficial and may cause harm. (See

         Heart failure (HF) is a major risk factor for adverse cardiac events, including death following noncardiac surgery. Data suggest that patients with chronic HF are at higher risk for major adverse cardiac events following noncardiac surgery than patients with coronary artery disease. (See

         Routine preoperative testing is generally not indicated. Preoperative tests are selected based upon clinical indications and likelihood of testing changing the decision to proceed with surgery and perioperative management. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is indicated in patients with dyspnea of unknown origin, suspected HF  (

         Our experts do not routinely use risk models to estimate the risk of surgery in patients with HF. However, in select patients with HF in whom the risk of surgery is unclear, a risk model estimate may contribute to the discussion of the risks and benefits of surgery. If use of a risk model is warranted, we prefer to use the

         Decision making for patients with HF with indications for noncardiac surgery is categorized according to the temporal necessity of surgery (emergency, urgent, or elective), the clinical HF syndrome, and the estimated perioperative risk  (

         For patients with chronic HF on evidence-based long-term therapy for HF, this therapy is generally continued preoperatively. For patients with HF who have not previously received these long-term medications, initiation of certain agents (eg, beta blockers) is generally delayed to avoid the potential risk of perioperative adverse effects.

         Postoperative monitoring should include assessment of volume status, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory status, including evaluation for symptoms and signs of acute HF. (See

         Evidence-based long-term therapy for HF is generally initiated or reinstated postoperatively as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable. (See
