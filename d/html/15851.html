In the dextro- or D-looped type (D-TGA), the ventricles are oriented so that the right ventricle is positioned to the right of the left ventricle and the origin of the aorta is anterior and rightward to the origin of the pulmonary artery (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68589" href="/d/graphic/68589.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). D-TGA is a form of cyanotic heart disease because there are two parallel circulations. </p><p>The management and outcome of D-TGA will be presented here. The anatomy, physiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of D-TGA are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14374.html" rel="external">"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Levo- or L-looped TGA (L-TGA; also commonly referred to as congenitally corrected TGA) is discussed separately.

However, D-TGA is one of the more difficult congenital heart diseases to detect prenatally and, therefore, many infants present postnatally. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14374.html" rel="external">"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Fetal diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>When the diagnosis of D-TGA is made prenatally, delivery should occur at a facility with a level III neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric cardiology expertise. If this is not feasible, transport arrangements should be established in advance of the delivery. Additional details regarding fetal diagnosis and pregnancy management are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6755.html" rel="external">"Congenital heart disease: Prenatal screening, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H948619"><span class="h1">INITIAL POSTNATAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neonates with suspected or confirmed D-TGA should be transported as quickly as possible to an institution that has expertise in managing infants with D-TGA. Prior to transport, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is necessary to ensure optimal medical management before and during the transfer.</p><p>Initial management focuses on stabilization of cardiac and pulmonary function and ensuring adequate systemic oxygenation. Therapy is directed towards providing sufficient mixing between the two parallel circulations by maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1; <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13353" href="/d/drug information/13353.html" rel="external">alprostadil</a>) infusion and/or balloon atrial septostomy (BAS).</p><p>Once the infant is stabilized, corrective surgery is optimally performed in the first weeks of life.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H948657"><span class="h2">Prostaglandin (alprostadil) infusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When the diagnosis of D-TGA is strongly suspected, a pediatric cardiologist should be consulted and a continuous intravenous PGE1 (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13353" href="/d/drug information/13353.html" rel="external">alprostadil</a>) infusion (0.05 mcg/kg per minute) should be started to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus. A patent ductus arteriosus promotes intercirculatory mixing.</p><p>The major side effect of PGE1 is apnea, and intubation should be considered prior to transport to a pediatric cardiac center. Vasodilation may cause hypotension, which is corrected with volume expansion using intravenous isotonic <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a>.</p><p>Use of PGE1 in neonates with ductal-dependent circulation is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5785.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Prostaglandin E1'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4434705"><span class="h2">Balloon atrial septostomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>BAS is performed to stabilize patients with severe hypoxemia as a consequence of inadequate mixing between the two parallel circuits [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. It can be performed at the bedside with echocardiographic guidance or in the catheterization lab with the use of fluoroscopy and echocardiography. A balloon is placed across the atrial septum into the left atrium either through cannulation of the umbilical vein or percutaneously via the femoral vein. The balloon is inflated and then pulled vigorously back across the septum. The procedure is repeated at least once, and then echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment of the defect is performed to ensure adequate intracardiac mixing.</p><p>If a BAS is performed and is successful, systemic oxygen saturations should begin to increase immediately. If there is adequate mixing at the atrial level, PGE1 infusion can often be discontinued, as long as there is no concern regarding aortic arch obstruction.</p><p>At our center, a bolus dose of heparin (50 units/kg) is given prior to performing BAS to minimize thrombus formation and subsequent embolization; however, this is not standardized and practice varies from center to center. The use of heparin in this setting is based on the theoretical concern for potential embolic brain injury as a consequence of BAS since the systemic venous return is in direct communication with the aorta and cerebral arterial circulation. Numerous studies have described magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in neonates with D-TGA, including focal ischemic changes, white matter changes, and periventricular leukomalacia, with reported prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 50 percent [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>]. However, it is uncertain to what extent the BAS itself contributes to this since multiple other factors are associated with brain injury, particularly the degree of hypoxemia and/or hemodynamic instability.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2923554"><span class="h1">SURGERY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The arterial switch operation (ASO) is the standard for surgical repair of D-TGA, and it has replaced the earlier atrial switch procedures developed by Mustard and Senning. Mortality associated with D-TGA has dramatically improved from approximately 90 percent for unoperated patients to rates of &lt;5 percent following corrective surgery with the ASO [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'After ASO'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H992841405"><span class="h2">Timing of surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgery is typically performed within the first two weeks of life. The timing of repair must be tailored to the infant's medical status and to technical considerations of the center's surgical team. In our practice, most patients are referred for surgical repair during the first three to five days of life.</p><p>In a case series from a tertiary center in the United States, delay of ASO beyond three days after birth was associated with higher morbidity and increased health care costs [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The question of whether the timing of surgery impacts neurodevelopmental outcome was examined in a prospective study of 45 patients undergoing surgical repair of D-TGA who had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed both pre- and postoperatively [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Older age at surgery (ie, postnatal age ≥2 weeks) and the presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) were associated with reduced perioperative brain growth. Older age at surgery was also predictive of lower language scores at age 18 months; however, the study was limited by the small number of patients who returned for 18-month follow-up (only 18 of 32 in the early repair group and 6 of 13 in the late repair group), thus limiting the ability to control for other potential confounding factors. As discussed below, neurodevelopmental outcomes following ASO are influenced by many other factors in addition to the timing of repair. (See <a class="local">'After ASO'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1253470745"><span class="h2">Choice of procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of surgical procedure is generally dependent on the presence and nature of other cardiac anomalies, particularly VSD and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Simple D-TGA</strong> – In patients with D-TGA with intact ventricular septum and without any other cardiac defects, ASO is the standard procedure. (See <a class="local">'Arterial switch operation (ASO)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>D-TGA with VSD</strong> – In patients with D-TGA and a VSD, the preferred procedure is ASO and VSD closure. (See <a class="local">'Arterial switch operation (ASO)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>D-TGA with VSD and LVOT obstruction</strong> – In patients with D-TGA, VSD, and significant LVOT obstruction (due to valvular, subvalvar, or multilevel obstruction), the Rastelli procedure is an alternative surgical approach that may be considered. ASO with or without intervention to relieve the LVOT obstruction is also a reasonable approach for some patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The choice between the two approaches is complex and depends in part on the size of the VSD, the nature of the LVOT obstruction, and the status of the pulmonary (neo-aortic) valve. Surgical decision-making in this setting focuses on minimizing the risk of recurrent LVOT obstruction, optimizing neo-aortic valve function, and balancing the risks of future reoperation. Factors that impact surgical planning include the morphology and size of the pulmonary (neo-aortic) valve, the coronary artery anatomy, the complexity of the LVOT, and the potential pathway created by the baffle from the left ventricle to the aorta [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Rastelli procedure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other surgical alternatives to address forms of D-TGA, VSD, and LVOT obstruction include the Nikaidoh procedure, Réparation à l'Etage ventriculaire (REV) procedure, and the Yasui procedure [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, these surgeries are less commonly performed and their procedural details are beyond the scope of this topic.</p><p></p><p>Both the ASO and Rastelli procedures are surgical anatomic corrections resulting in a morphologic left ventricle as the systemic ventricle. In contrast, atrial switch procedures (also referred to as the Mustard and Senning procedures) involve rerouting venous return in the atria, resulting in a systemic right ventricle. Atrial switch procedures are now only rarely performed, chiefly for complex palliations of selected patients with congenitally corrected TGA (L-TGA). Management of L-TGA is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130666.html" rel="external">"L-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA): Management and outcome", section on 'Surgical management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5811268"><span class="h2">Arterial switch operation (ASO)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ASO, originally performed in 1975, has become the standard corrective procedure for patients with D-TGA who do not have significant LVOT obstruction [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The ASO has been used as the preferred procedure for patients with D-TGA since the late 1980s. The overall perioperative mortality with the ASO has dropped to &lt;1 percent in patients with simple D-TGA (ie, no other cardiac anomaly) and 4 percent for those with complex D-TGA (ie, additional cardiac anomaly) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>ASO involves transection of both great arteries and then translocation of the vessels to the opposite root, thereby creating ventriculoarterial concordance (aorta to left ventricle, and pulmonary artery to right ventricle). Translocating the aorta also involves mobilization and reimplantation of the coronary arteries. In the ASO, "buttons" around the coronaries are created and then reimplanted into the neo-aortic root. Thus, it is important to delineate coronary artery anatomy, which is often aberrant, prior to surgical correction (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60625" href="/d/graphic/60625.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14374.html" rel="external">"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Other cardiac anomalies'</a>.)</p><p>The LeCompte maneuver, first described in 1981, is widely utilized when performing the ASO. This surgical technique places the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries anterior to the aorta so that the left and right pulmonary arteries straddle the ascending aorta [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. This allows for improved orientation of the branch pulmonary arteries and reduces the tension that is created from the anterior translocation of the pulmonary arterial root. The use of this maneuver decreases the risk of subsequent pulmonary artery stenosis and lowers reintervention rates [<a href="#rid8">8,15,16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Main and branch pulmonary artery stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A complete preoperative anatomic assessment is essential. The presence of a VSD confers a higher probability of other anatomic abnormalities and can make surgical correction more difficult. Additional surgical procedures may be necessary at the time of the ASO (eg, aortic arch or atrioventricular valve repair). In patients with particular forms of LVOT obstruction, the Rastelli procedure may be preferred over the ASO. (See <a class="local">'Rastelli procedure'</a> below.)</p><p>Complications following ASO are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Complications after ASO'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5811275"><span class="h2">Rastelli procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Rastelli procedure, first described in 1969, is typically performed in patients with D-TGA associated with a large VSD and LVOT obstruction [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The Rastelli procedure is preferred over the ASO for some patients because it provides superior and more durable relief of LVOT obstruction. The decision to perform the Rastelli procedure rather than the ASO with LVOT reconstruction is largely based on the nature of the LVOT obstruction and the status of the pulmonary (neo-aortic) valve.</p><p>The Rastelli procedure entails:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Baffling the LVOT through the VSD, which closes the VSD and directs oxygenated blood from the left ventricle into the aorta</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><strong>and</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Placing a conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery</p><p></p><p>The net result is that oxygenated blood from the left ventricle flows into the aorta, and the unoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is sent through the conduit into the pulmonary artery.</p><p>The Rastelli procedure requires a sizable and appropriately located VSD. In some patients with a restrictive VSD, the VSD is enlarged to allow appropriate baffle placement [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. VSD enlargement may reduce the risk of recurrent LVOT obstruction [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] but may increase the risk of complete heart block and need for a pacemaker.</p><p>Perioperative mortality following the Rastelli procedure is &lt;5 percent [<a href="#rid12">12,20</a>]. Long-term complications are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Complications after Rastelli procedure'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2923569"><span class="h2">Mustard and Senning procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Atrial switch procedures (including the Mustard and Senning procedures) are no longer performed in the modern era. They have been supplanted by the ASO because they are associated with long-term sequelae, including atrial arrhythmias and heart failure, that contribute to substantial late morbidity and mortality. These complications are related to the morphologic right ventricle serving as the pump for the systemic circulation. (See <a class="local">'Complications after Mustard and Senning procedures'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13599.html" rel="external">"Atrial arrhythmias (including AV block) in congenital heart disease"</a>.)</p><p>The Mustard and Senning procedures convert the parallel circulations of D-TGA into a circulation in series, thereby correcting cyanosis. However, they do not correct the underlying ventriculoarterial discordance of the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50524" href="/d/graphic/50524.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). In both procedures, an intra-atrial baffle is created to divert the deoxygenated systemic venous return through the mitral valve to the left ventricle, and into the pulmonary circulation via the pulmonary artery. Simultaneously, the baffle directs oxygenated pulmonary venous return across the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle, and subsequently to the aorta and the systemic circulation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1360013580"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3454723606"><span class="h2">Complications after ASO</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications that require reintervention occur in 5 to 25 percent of patients who have undergone arterial switch operation (ASO) [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]. The lesion that most often requires reintervention is pulmonary artery stenosis. Other complications are less common but may include coronary artery insufficiency, neo-aortic root dilation, and neo-aortic regurgitation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4245343757"><span class="h3">Main and branch pulmonary artery stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary artery stenosis is the most common indication for reintervention following ASO in the first year of life. Inadequate growth at the neo-pulmonary anastomotic site contributes to pulmonary stenosis. The reported incidence of operative or catheterization-based reintervention ranges from 5 to 28 percent [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. The wide range likely reflects differences in the surgical approach. The practice of routinely performing ASO in the neonatal period has reduced the need for pulmonary artery banding, with lower likelihood of subsequent stenosis. In addition, widespread use of the LeCompte maneuver has further reduced the incidence of pulmonary stenosis such that, in the modern era, the reintervention rate for pulmonary artery stenosis is &lt;5 percent [<a href="#rid8">8,15,16</a>].</p><p>The obstruction most commonly is located in the supravalvar area of the main pulmonary artery, but it can be found at all levels of the right ventricular outflow tract and the branch pulmonary arteries. Supravalvar stenosis is thought to result from scarring at the anastomotic site or inadequate growth of the main pulmonary artery [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis is generally a consequence of tension on the branch pulmonary arteries from their anterior translocation. The latter process may be mitigated by the LeCompte maneuver. Prior pulmonary artery banding, repair outside of the neonatal period, and surgical technique have been identified as risk factors.</p><p>Assessment for pulmonary artery stenosis begins with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which is a routine part of postoperative follow-up (see <a class="local">'Follow-up care'</a> below). TTE should include estimation of right ventricular pressure and assessment of proximal pulmonary arteries. TTE is not sensitive in detecting branch pulmonary artery stenosis, particularly after the LeCompte maneuver. Thus, if there is concern on TTE for elevated right ventricular pressure and the proximal pulmonary arteries are not well visualized, alternative imaging techniques, such as MRI, should be considered to better characterize the branch pulmonary arteries. In one study, proximal branch pulmonary artery stenosis was detected in only 60 to 70 percent of affected patients with TTE, while cardiac MRI identified almost 90 percent of lesions [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>Intervention for pulmonary artery stenosis is generally warranted when the right ventricular pressure approaches systemic levels or if there is discrepant pulmonary blood flow on lung perfusion scan. Intervention typically consists of catheter-based dilation with stent placement, though surgical revision infrequently may be required, depending on the anatomical details.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2568833141"><span class="h3">Coronary artery stenosis or insufficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the early years of the ASO, the coronary artery transfer was the surgical step that created the most difficulty and led to coronary insufficiency and high hospital mortality. As coronary artery transfer techniques improved, the hospital mortality dropped rapidly to a low level. The long-term success of this procedure, however, depends on the continued patency and growth of the coronary vessels to ensure adequate myocardial blood flow.</p><p>The incidence of coronary events continues to be bimodal, with the majority of events (89 percent) occurring in the first three months following the ASO [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. These tend to be related to "kinking" or other anatomic obstructions to coronary perfusion. Unexplained ventricular dysfunction or poor hemodynamics should prompt early evaluation of the coronaries in the postoperative setting.</p><p>In one study of 1198 survivors after ASO born between 1982 and 2001, the freedom from coronary events was reportedly 92.7 percent at 1 year and 88.2 percent at 15 years, confirming the increased risk of coronary events in the postoperative period [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Risk factors for the development of coronary events include type of coronary anatomy (presence of a single coronary orifice or two coronary orifices originating close to each other) and the occurrence of a major intraoperative event (coronary translocation difficulty, left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac arrest, or temporary mechanical support at the end of the intervention). In this study, 11 patients underwent coronary revascularization at least one year after the ASO.</p><p>However, many patients with coronary artery stenosis or obstruction may be asymptomatic. Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for detecting coronary lesions. Studies that performed postoperative angiography report rates of coronary lesions between 3 to 6.8 percent [<a href="#rid8">8,30-32</a>]. Unfortunately, less invasive screening tests, such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, stress tests, and myocardial scintigraphy, have shown poor sensitivity for detecting coronary lesions and myocardial ischemia [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. This is likely due to the development of a collateral coronary circulation that provides sufficient myocardial perfusion to limit detection of ischemia on these various screening tests. Magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomographic angiography appear to be reasonable alternatives to catheterization [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Increased experience with these modalities will hopefully reduce the need for invasive angiography in patients after ASO in the future.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1849910124"><span class="h3">Early atherosclerotic coronary artery disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is a hypothetical concern that the process of coronary transfer may predispose these patients to the development of intimal thickening due to altered flow dynamics.

Although neo-aortic root dilation continued to develop in late follow-up, the increase was not clinically significant over time. Risk factors for neo-aortic root dilation were previous pulmonary arterial banding and ASO performed in a later era. The association between neo-aortic root dilation and surgery in a later era is likely due to changes in surgical technique related to increased size of the coronary "buttons" taken for the translocation.

(See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/115414.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Congenital heart disease in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2923654"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomy and physiology</strong> – D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) is a form of cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by ventriculoarterial discordance (the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle) (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68589" href="/d/graphic/68589.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). This defect results in the creation of two parallel circulations in which deoxygenated systemic venous blood returns to the right atrium and is sent back to the systemic circulation via the right ventricle and aorta, while simultaneously, oxygenated pulmonary venous blood returning to the left atrium is pumped back to the lungs via the left ventricle and pulmonary artery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14374.html" rel="external">"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial postnatal management</strong> – Neonates with suspected or confirmed D-TGA should be urgently transported to an institution with expertise in managing infants with congenital heart disease. Prior to transport, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is advised to ensure optimal medical management before and during the transport.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Initial postnatal management is focused on stabilization of cardiac and pulmonary function and ensuring adequate systemic oxygenation. Therapy is directed towards providing sufficient mixing between the two circulatory systems by maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1; <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13353" href="/d/drug information/13353.html" rel="external">alprostadil</a>, 0.05 mcg/kg per minute) infusion. Patients with severe hypoxemia may require balloon atrial septostomy (BAS). (See <a class="local">'Initial postnatal management'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5785.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Prostaglandin E1'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical repair</strong> – The arterial switch operation (ASO) is the standard for surgical repair of D-TGA. ASO involves transection of both great arteries and then translocation of the vessels to the opposite root, thereby creating ventriculoarterial concordance (aorta to left ventricle and pulmonary artery to right ventricle). (See <a class="local">'Arterial switch operation (ASO)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients with D-TGA associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, the Rastelli procedure is an alternative option for surgical repair. The Rastelli procedure entails closing the VSD with a baffle, so that the oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is directed into the aorta, and placing a conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. (See <a class="local">'Rastelli procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ASO has replaced the earlier atrial switch procedures (also referred to as the Mustard and Senning procedures) because of its superior long-term outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Mustard and Senning procedures'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postoperative outcomes and complications</strong> – Perioperative mortality associated with ASO is very low (&lt;1 percent for simple D-TGA [ie, no other cardiac anomaly]; approximately 4 percent for complex D-TGA [ie, additional cardiac anomaly]). Long-term survival is excellent, with &gt;95 percent survival at 15 to 25 years following surgery. (See <a class="local">'After ASO'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The most common complication of ASO is pulmonary artery stenosis, which may require reintervention. Other long-term complications are uncommon but may include coronary artery insufficiency, neo-aortic root dilation, and neo-aortic regurgitation. Patients who underwent surgical repair in an earlier era with an atrial switch procedure (Mustard and Senning procedures) are more likely to experience long-term morbidities, especially arrhythmia and right heart failure. (See <a class="local">'Complications after ASO'</a> above and <a class="local">'Complications after Mustard and Senning procedures'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-term follow-up</strong> – All patients who have undergone surgical repair of D-TGA require long-term cardiology follow-up. Follow-up visits should include review of the interval history (focusing on any new cardiac symptoms), physical examination, and testing that typically includes an electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac imaging (usually with echocardiography), and lipid screening. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who have undergone ASO have a slightly reduced exercise capacity, but this does not typically restrict their daily level of activity. However, patients who wish to participate in competitive sports should undergo formal evaluation including ECG, echocardiogram, and exercise testing. (See <a class="local">'After ASO'</a> above and <a class="local">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with D-TGA may have mild long-term neurodevelopmental impairment, most likely due to perioperative factors including hypoxemia, cardiopulmonary bypass, and hemodynamic instability. Following repair of D-TGA, all infants and children should undergo routine screening for developmental delays. (See <a class="local">'Outcome'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/615.html" rel="external">"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care"</a>.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Blyth M, Howe D, Gnanapragasam J, Wellesley D.
