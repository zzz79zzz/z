         The vasogenic edema that surrounds many brain tumors contributes significantly to morbidity. This edema results from disruption of the blood-brain barrier, allowing protein-rich fluid to accumulate in the extracellular space [

         The pathogenesis of peritumoral vasogenic edema and the use of glucocorticoids are reviewed here. The acute treatment of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is discussed elsewhere. (See

         Tumor-related disruption in the blood-brain barrier is caused by two major mechanisms:

         The absence of tight endothelial cell junctions in tumor blood vessels. These vessels develop in response to angiogenic factors such as VEGF [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF2) [
         <a href="#rid5">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In large part, VEGF is responsible for the loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier in brain tumors. Gliomas, meningiomas, and metastatic tumors all have upregulation of VEGF [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9
         </a>
         ]. VEGF is secreted by tumor cells as well as host stromal cells and binds to its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, which are located primarily on the surface of endothelial cells. VEGF stimulates the formation of gaps in the endothelium, a process that leads to fluid leakage into the brain parenchyma, thereby resulting in vasogenic edema [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Vasogenic edema tends to spread more readily in the extracellular space of white matter rather than gray matter, possibly because of lower resistance to flow within the white matter [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Tumor-related edema may disrupt synaptic transmission, alter neuronal excitability, and contribute to headaches, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and encephalopathy. Furthermore, unchecked cerebral edema may result in fatal herniation because the brain is encased in the rigid cranium.

         Patients with brain tumor-related vasogenic edema should be evaluated for associated signs and symptoms to determine whether glucocorticoids are necessary. The extent of edema on neuroimaging must be interpreted alongside clinical symptoms, as not all edema requires symptomatic treatment.

         Symptoms of vasogenic edema vary based on the location and extent of the edema. In many cases, symptoms are multifactorial and caused by a combination of the local effects of brain edema (usually reversible) and tumor or treatment-related tissue injury (usually irreversible). Glucocorticoids can be expected to provide symptomatic benefit to the extent that symptoms are related to vasogenic edema.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms of accumulating edema tend to progress in a subacute fashion, with an insidious onset and gradual worsening from one day to the next. Less commonly, patients become symptomatic more abruptly, in a stroke-like fashion (eg, waking up with new deficits), presumably because a symptomatic threshold has been crossed. In such cases, unwitnessed seizure with postictal deficits should also be considered as a possible explanation (in addition to stroke).
        </p>
        <p>
         Headaches related to vasogenic edema are usually diffuse and bilateral, although they may be felt unilaterally on the side of the tumor. The quality of the pain is often described as dull and throbbing. With more extensive amounts of edema, headaches may have characteristics of increased intracranial pressure (ICP; eg, worse in the mornings, associated with nausea or vomiting). Additional signs of increased ICP may include drowsiness, papilledema, and symptomatic plateau waves, manifest as presyncope or syncope-like events related to a decrease in cerebral perfusion when ICP transiently rises above a certain level. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1659.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Focal deficits vary based on the location of edema. For metastatic brain tumors in particular, focal vasogenic edema is often the dominant cause of symptoms (rather than the tumor itself). As an example, a patient with a new left posterior frontal brain metastasis presenting with a right hemiparesis may experience complete recovery of strength upon initiation of glucocorticoids, before tumor-specific therapy is initiated.

         Vasogenic edema is hypodense compared with normal gray and white matter on computed tomography (CT). Particularly when extensive, it causes mass effect (ie, effacement of cerebral sulci or subarachnoid spaces, compression or displacement of the ventricles, midline shift [subfalcine herniation], or other types of brain herniation)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef138494" href="/z/d/graphic/138494.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), vasogenic edema is hypointense on T1-weighted images, is hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted images, and does not enhance after contrast administration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef138494" href="/z/d/graphic/138494.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ). In contrast to cytotoxic edema, vasogenic edema is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         associated with reduced water diffusivity on diffusion-weighted MRI  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef138495" href="/z/d/graphic/138495.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ) or increased perfusion on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) or arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion sequences. In addition, vasogenic edema tends to respect the boundaries of white matter, in contrast to infiltrative tumor, such as glioma  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef138494" href="/z/d/graphic/138494.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Vasogenic edema is reversible, although it lags behind clinical effects of glucocorticoids on neuroimaging by days and up to weeks. Although rare, extensive or longstanding edema can result in irreversible hyperintense signal on FLAIR and T2-weighted MRI, which may persist even with resolution of the underlying process. In this way, acute and chronic edema have a similar appearance on MRI, and the distinction requires clinical correlation and comparison of serial imaging studies, when available.

Doses as high as 40 mg/day may be given in the emergency setting for brain tumor-related edema and mass effect. Additional interventions during the first 24 to 72 hours may be required to lower ICP, such as hypertonic

         Systemic glucocorticoids should be considered in all patients who have symptomatic peritumoral edema. Depending on the location of the tumor and the extent of edema, symptoms may be generalized (eg, headache, nausea, vomiting) or focal (eg, aphasia, hemiparesis), or both. (See

         Most patients who are asymptomatic do not require steroids, although clinical judgment is required in patients with large amounts of edema, particularly when antitumor therapy has the potential to worsen edema. Increased caution is also required for posterior fossa tumors and edema, which can be associated with rapid deterioration.

         When patients fail to improve or improve only partially after several days on the initial dose, there are two main possibilities. Either a higher dose is required, or the residual symptoms are caused by factors other than peritumoral edema.
        </p>
        <p>
         A trial-and-error strategy is often used to help distinguish between the two. For patients on submaximal doses, the

          dexamethasone
         </a>
         dose is typically doubled for up to three days as a trial (usual maximum total daily dose, 16 mg). If the patient improves clinically, the higher dose is continued. The less a patient responds to a doubling of the dose, the less likely it is that symptoms are steroid responsive. If there is no response by 72 hours, the dose can generally be returned to the previous dose level without taper. This strategy helps to avoid excessive steroid dosing and toxicity in the absence of clinical benefit.

         </a>
         ]. This is particularly important for patients on high initial doses of dexamethasone (eg, &gt;8 mg daily), as weight gain and proximal muscle weakness often emerge within weeks at such doses. The likelihood of success and speed of the taper depend on multiple factors, including status of the underlying tumor, concurrent therapies, and duration of steroid therapy. Postoperative steroid tapers in patients who have undergone complete tumor resection can be relatively rapid, for example, whereas efforts to taper steroids in patients with residual or progressive tumors must be approached more cautiously.

         has a long duration of action, and therefore a period of at least three to four days should generally follow each dose decrement to establish clinical tolerance of the lower dose. For patients in good clinical condition whose tumor has been stabilized with recent treatment, a taper may entail a reduction in dose of up to 50 percent every four days. A more protracted taper and chronic treatment may be required for patients with active tumors and those who do not tolerate initial attempts to wean steroids.

        <p>
         Symptoms not caused by recurrence of brain edema may develop during the course of the steroid taper (steroid withdrawal syndrome). These include mild headache and lethargy that may mimic recurrence of brain edema as well as myalgias and arthralgias (steroid pseudorheumatism).

         Management of chronic, symptomatic edema can be challenging. Many patients develop toxicities related to chronic glucocorticoids, which in some cases eventually outweigh the benefits. Surgical debulking of the associated tumor may be indicated in select cases, even when the goal is not curative, in order to help control the underlying cause of the edema.

         Plateau waves are sustained pressure waves that normally occur within the brain and are caused by activities that transiently raise the ICP (eg, standing, sneezing, coughing). In the presence of a brain tumor, significant further increases in ICP can temporarily cut off cerebral perfusion, leading to loss of consciousness.

          table 3

         ). Because the duration of steroid therapy is often unpredictable and tapers can last longer than initially planned, some clinicians routinely start prophylaxis as soon as dexamethasone is initiated. This risk is distinct from that associated with temozolomide-induced lymphopenia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1393.html" rel="external">

         The risk of symptomatic PCP infection is increased while glucocorticoids are being tapered [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. Concurrent chemotherapy may be an additional risk factor for the development of PCP [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective review of 587 patients with primary brain tumors seen at a single institution over an eight-year period, there were 11 histologically documented cases of PCP in 10 patients (1.7 percent) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. The patients had been on
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">
          dexamethasone
         </a>
         for a median of three months when symptoms first developed. In 8 of 11 episodes, PCP occurred during the steroid taper.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism by which glucocorticoids predispose to the development of PCP is poorly understood, but suppression of cellular immunity leading to reactivation of latent infection probably plays a role. Why PCP more commonly develops during steroid taper is also unknown. Possible factors include increased immune-mediated lung damage from PCP infection, which had been suppressed by higher doses of glucocorticoids, and a positive effect of glucocorticoids on surfactant phospholipids that are decreased in PCP [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians caring for patients with brain tumors who are receiving glucocorticoids should maintain a high index of suspicion for PCP. Although the hallmark of PCP is fever and dyspnea with or without a prominent dry cough, the presentation can be subtle and nonspecific. Thus, the diagnosis should be considered in any patient developing respiratory symptoms. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1401.html" rel="external">

When NSAIDs are necessary, use of a selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor or

         Glucocorticoids increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, especially when used in conjunction with other drugs such as NSAIDs. Concurrent anticoagulation therapy and a prior history of peptic ulcer disease are other factors that can increase the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving glucocorticoids.

         Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy contributes significantly to morbidity in patients with brain tumors. Myopathy is a common complication, with an estimated incidence between 2 and 20 percent. (See

         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Some patients become weak after a low dose of glucocorticoids for a few weeks, while others never develop myopathy despite receiving large doses of glucocorticoids for months or years. The onset is usually subacute, occurring over several weeks. Symptoms often include difficulty rising from a seated position, difficulty climbing or descending stairs, and gait instability. Muscle pain is not a feature and tendon reflexes are preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of steroid myopathy is difficult. Ideally, glucocorticoids should be discontinued, but the lowest possible dose should be used if this is not feasible. Recovery after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy can be expected within two to three months but may be much slower if treatment is continued, even at a reduced dose. Physical therapy and exercise may be useful in preventing and treating muscle weakness in patients receiving glucocorticoids [
         <a href="#rid35">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Another treatment approach is to change the glucocorticoid preparation. Steroid myopathy has been particularly associated with the use of fluorinated glucocorticoids such as

        <p>
         For most brain tumor patients, the gradual steroid taper necessitated by cerebral edema management is sufficiently slow to protect against adrenal insufficiency when the taper is finished. However, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for adrenal insufficiency in patients with prolonged steroid exposure. When in doubt, the responsiveness of the adrenal gland can be assessed with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH [cosyntropin]) stimulation test before the glucocorticoid dose is lowered below physiologic replacement levels (approximately 0.5 to 1 mg daily for

         For patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), steroids may lead to a temporary complete radiologic response. Therefore, they should be used cautiously in the preoperative setting when PCNSL is on the differential diagnosis. (See

         It is important to consider differences in glucocorticoid dose when determining treatment response, as an increase in steroids can mimic treatment response and steroid reduction can mimic tumor progression.
