In patients whose condition is resistant to an initial course of treatment with a nonbiologic (also termed conventional synthetic [cs] or traditional) disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD), such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX), timely adjustments in the treatment regimen are required to achieve effective disease control and prevent damage to the joints. (See <a class="local">'Principles of management'</a> below and <a class="local">'Definition of resistance to initial therapy with conventional synthetic DMARDs'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for an early aggressive approach to treatment is based upon the observations that joint damage, which may ultimately result in disability, begins early in the course of disease, and that the longer disease activity persists, the less likely the patient is to respond to therapy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Improved outcomes have resulted from the use of potent and well-tolerated csDMARDs and biologic DMARDs used alone and in combination to induce and maintain tight control of disease [<a href="#rid2">2-10</a>]. These medications and strategies have the potential to control synovitis and to slow or even stop radiographic progression [<a href="#rid2">2,9,11,12</a>].</p><p>The treatment of active RA in adults who are resistant to initial therapy with a csDMARD (eg, MTX monotherapy) will be reviewed here. The general principles of the management of RA, initial treatment of RA, the treatment of patients resistant to initial therapy with biologic DMARDs, and the approach to RA patients with severe structural damage are presented separately.

A therapeutic trial of greater than three months is generally used in patients with partial responses showing progressive improvement, particularly in those with low to moderate levels of disease activity and with limited functional impairment. Treatment should be appropriate for the patient's overall medical status and comorbidities and should take into consideration the patient's treatment goals and preferences. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7494.html" rel="external">"Assessment of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and physical function", section on 'Criteria for remission'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A requirement, in addition to DMARDs, for chronic glucocorticoid therapy in a dose of greater than approximately 5 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> or equivalent to achieve or maintain remission or low disease activity after three to six months of treatment with DMARDs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A requirement for multiple courses of treatment with glucocorticoids, in excess of doses used for chronic therapy, for the treatment of recurrent disease flares in patients whose medication doses have been increased to the maximally tolerated or acceptable level.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continued progression of erosive disease or structural damage that is not accounted for by prior joint damage.</p><p></p><p>Resistance or an inadequate response to DMARD therapy may be defined similarly, depending upon the treatment goals in an individual patient.

Precautions relevant to the use of each new agent being prescribed should be reviewed before initiating such therapy to confirm that all appropriate measures have been performed. Some experts also obtain a baseline chest radiograph prior to initiating treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX) in patients in whom a recent chest radiograph is not available.

The choices include both conventional synthetic (cs) and biologic DMARDs. The specific approach is influenced by the treatments the patient has already received and the level of disease activity:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Resistant to </strong><strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong><strong> or </strong><strong>sulfasalazine</strong> – In patients with only mildly active disease when DMARDs were initiated, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9963" href="/z/d/drug information/9963.html" rel="external">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ) may have been started, and the patient may not have received <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> (MTX). Such patients should then be started on MTX, either in place of or in addition to these agents. (See <a class="local">'Resistant to hydroxychloroquine and/or sulfasalazine'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Resistant to </strong><strong>methotrexate</strong> – In patients who have already been treated with MTX without achieving therapeutic goals, treatment combining MTX with other csDMARDs or with a biologic DMARD is the next step. (See <a class="local">'Resistant to methotrexate'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Drug choice should also be tailored to the individual patient based upon their comorbid conditions, fertility considerations, and preference for route of administration (oral versus parenteral), as well as regulatory or insurance limitations and cost to the patient. (See <a class="local">'Choice of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H109285579"><span class="h2">Resistant to hydroxychloroquine and/or sulfasalazine</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment options</strong> – In patients with initially mildly active disease who are resistant to three to six months of therapy with HCQ or SSZ, we suggest adding MTX along with both HCQ and SSZ or switching to MTX monotherapy; the approach in these patients is generally similar to that for patients with moderately to severely active disease presenting for initial DMARD therapy. When MTX is added to the regimen of HCQ and SSZ, this is termed "triple therapy." The continued or added use of HCQ, SSZ, or both depends upon drug tolerance and patient willingness to take several oral agents. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7477.html" rel="external">"Alternatives to methotrexate for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Monitoring and reevaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Initial therapy with methotrexate'</a> and <a class="local">'DMARD triple therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A therapeutic trial of greater than three months can be used in patients with partial responses showing progressive improvement, particularly in those in this group with low levels of disease activity and limited functional impairment. In most cases, if there has not been a significant response after 12 weeks on a particular regimen, then a change in the therapeutic regimen is required. For example, patients receiving MTX can benefit from an increased dose or switching to subcutaneous administration if the dose has not already been optimized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7507.html" rel="external">"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Dosing and administration'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy and rationale</strong> – We prefer MTX over alternative csDMARDs and biologic DMARDs in such patients for several reasons. MTX typically serves as the "anchor" drug for the most commonly used DMARD combinations [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. Randomized head-to-head trials have found that MTX has a faster onset of action, comparable or greater efficacy, better long-term tolerance, and results in improved survival compared with other csDMARD monotherapy [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Direct comparisons of MTX with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor monotherapy have also shown similar clinical benefit, with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 percent (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses after 6 to 12 months of approximately 60, 40, and 20 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additionally, those patients with an inadequate response to MTX can be quickly identified and subsequently treated prior to the development of irreversible injury [<a href="#rid18">18-23</a>]. There is also some evidence that infectious risk may be greater with biologic agents, and there are frequently regulatory or cost barriers to the use of biologic therapies in patients who have not been treated with MTX.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Treatment with MTX is reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Initial therapy with methotrexate'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Methotrexate versus other DMARDs'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7491.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Methotrexate versus initial combination therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The efficacy of "triple therapy" with this DMARD combination is discussed in further detail below. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy of triple DMARD therapy versus methotrexate/TNF inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12087126"><span class="h2">Resistant to methotrexate</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12087392"><span class="h3">Choice of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients resistant to MTX after three to six months of treatment at optimal doses and route of administration (usually 25 mg/week), we suggest either the use of DMARD "triple therapy" with MTX plus SSZ and HCQ, or the combination of continued MTX plus the addition of a TNF inhibitor, rather than monotherapy with another csDMARD, biologic DMARD, or targeted synthetic (ts) DMARD. Professional society guidelines favor the addition of a biologic DMARD or tsDMARD over triple therapy in an MTX nonresponder [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. That guideline was "vigorously debated," and ultimately advised based upon patient preference for faster resolution of symptoms than with csDMARD triple therapy. We continue to utilize both approaches, as triple therapy has shown equal long-term efficacy to the combination of MTX plus anti-TNF therapy. Concerning safety data on tsDMARDs (Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor class) have led to guidance that they be used only after an inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Optimization of MTX therapy is described in more detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7507.html" rel="external">"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>). Reasonable alternatives to these approaches include a JAK inhibitor, which can be classified as a tsDMARD, or a non-TNF inhibitor biologic DMARD in combination with MTX. (See <a class="local">'Alternatives to triple therapy and methotrexate/TNF inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with partial responses or showing progressive improvement, we may continue therapy with MTX for greater than three months before switching to one of these approaches, particularly in those with low to moderate levels of disease activity and with limited functional impairment. Another option would be switching from oral to subcutaneous MTX to see if the response could be enhanced. Studies evaluating subcutaneous MTX have demonstrated greater bioavailability, and approximately 30 percent of patients who switched had improvement in clinical response. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7507.html" rel="external">"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis", section on 'Parenteral therapy'</a> and <a class="local">'DMARD triple therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Methotrexate plus TNF inhibitor'</a> below and <a class="local">'Alternatives to triple therapy and methotrexate/TNF inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients begun on a biologic DMARD (eg, a TNF inhibitor) or tsDMARD (eg, a JAK inhibitor), we generally continue MTX, unless contraindicated; in this setting, MTX may improve the degree of clinical and radiographic benefit and, for certain biologics, can inhibit the development of antibodies directed at the biologic agent that can reduce efficacy, as demonstrated in multiple clinical trials [<a href="#rid26">26</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7974.html" rel="external">"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Induction of antibodies, autoantibodies, and autoimmune diseases", section on 'Anti-drug antibodies'</a>). However, in our experience and that of others, as many as 30 percent of patients discontinue their csDMARD, usually MTX, after they obtain benefit with biologic DMARDs or with a tsDMARD (eg, JAK inhibitor) therapy [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

The use of triple therapy has been shown to provide comparable or near-comparable benefit, depending upon the trial, and to do so at a markedly lower total cost, being highly cost-effective compared with combining a biologic with MTX [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. In addition, concern regarding the risk of serious infections, uncertainty in the setting of previous or current malignancy, and other possible adverse effects may influence clinician or patient preference for conventional synthetic agents [<a href="#rid30">30-33</a>].

These features, several or more of which are often present, include high titer rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated peptide antibody, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and baseline erosive disease. All of the available TNF inhibitors appear to provide comparable benefit. These regimens may have a faster onset of action compared with csDMARD triple therapy.

However, use of a TNF inhibitor or other biologic requires subcutaneous injections or intravenous infusions, and regulatory or cost considerations may limit access to these agents and to the JAK inhibitors.

In such patients, we either discontinue SSZ and HCQ and administer a TNF inhibitor with the MTX, or continue both the HCQ and SSZ (or just one of the agents, usually the HCQ) when adding a TNF inhibitor, particularly in patients who have experienced partial clinical benefit.

LEF may be of particular benefit for patients in whom regulatory or cost considerations preclude use of a biologic agent, despite failure of MTX to adequately control disease activity.
