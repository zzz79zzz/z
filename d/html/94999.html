These include sickle cell anemia (homozygous sickle mutation), sickle-beta thalassemia, hemoglobin SC disease, and others.</p><p>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a relatively frequent and severe complication of SCD and an independent risk factor for mortality [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. The prevalence, pathogenesis, screening, and treatment of PH associated with SCD are discussed here. A discussion of other aspects of SCD and overviews of the pulmonary complications of SCD and of PH in patients without SCD are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7121.html" rel="external">"Overview of the pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121912.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults (group 1)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H322249048"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with PH are classified into one of five groups based upon etiology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Patients in the first group are considered to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1 PAH), while patients in the remaining four groups are considered to have PH (groups 2, 3, 4, and 5). When all five groups are discussed collectively, the term PH is used. SCD is placed in group 5, as there are some patients with hemodynamics consistent with PAH, while others have features of PH related to left-sided heart disease (group 2) or thromboembolic disease (group 4) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Postdiagnostic testing and classification'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Group 1 – PAH</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Group 2 – PH due to left heart disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Group 3 – PH due to chronic lung disease and/or hypoxemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Group 4 – PH due to pulmonary artery obstructions (eg, chronic thromboembolic PH)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Group 5 – PH due to unclear multifactorial mechanisms (eg, SCD, beta-thalassemia, myeloproliferative disorders, sarcoidosis, and metabolic disorders)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H879456965"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Echocardiographic screening studies have identified evidence of elevated pulmonary pressures, defined as a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) ≥2.5 m/sec (equivalent to a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of approximately 36 mmHg), in 30 to 40 percent of adults with hemoglobin SS (HbSS) and 10 to 28 percent of adults with HbSC disease [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. Additionally, up to 22 percent of HbSS children and adolescents have this echocardiographic finding [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], including children as young as three years of age [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary pressures are substantially less accurate than right heart catheterization, with a positive predictive value of 31 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Three prospective studies utilizing right heart catheterization have defined the prevalence of PH in SCD (using a definition of mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg) to be between 6 and 10.5 percent [<a href="#rid7">7,12,13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H879456971"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The exact pathogenesis of PH in SCD is not known, but a number of potential contributing factors have been implicated, including endothelial injury from recurrent sickling, acute and chronic inflammation, hypercoagulability and thrombosis, chronic intravascular hemolysis, and altered bioavailability of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) [<a href="#rid14">14-18</a>]. Vascular remodeling caused by chronically elevated left heart pressures from diastolic dysfunction may also contribute, similar to PH group 2, which is purely due to left heart disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>One theory is that hemolysis results in increased plasma levels of cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) in excess of the binding capacity of the Hb scavengers, haptoglobin and hemopexin. This excess of cell-free Hb may rapidly deplete circulating NO, although there is continuing disagreement over the impact of this process on NO bioavailability [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. In addition to these effects on endothelial regulation, increased levels of cell-free Hb may also contribute to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle dysfunction [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8247.html" rel="external">"The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)", section on 'Pathogenetic mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>NO bioavailability in SCD is additionally impacted by a number of other factors:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated plasma levels of arginase, also released from red cells, limit the bioavailability of L-arginine, the substrate for NO synthesis, by increasing its breakdown to ornithine  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79786" href="/d/graphic/79786.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid17">17,22-24</a>]. In one study, plasma arginase activity was significantly elevated in 228 patients with SCD as compared with 36 controls; the highest activity was seen in those with secondary PH [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Lower bioavailability of arginine, as reflected by a low ratio of arginine to ornithine, was associated with markers of inflammation and soluble adhesion molecules, greater severity of PH, and a significantly increased risk of mortality (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.2).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, may also be an independent risk factor for endothelial dysfunction [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In a study of 177 patients with SCD and 29 controls, ADMA levels correlated with markers of hemolysis, low oxygen saturation, PH, and early death. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16307.html" rel="external">"Overview of possible risk factors for cardiovascular disease", section on 'Asymmetrical dimethylarginine'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased oxidant-related metabolism of NO can reduce the availability of NO to act as a vasodilator. The predominant activities of NO as a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation occur when it reacts with thiols, primarily on albumin, to form S-nitrosothiols [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Altered redox biology occurs in SCD, and increased concentrations of the oxidative molecules including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide exist within the red blood cells of these patients [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. These oxidative molecules can react with NO to create nitrate, nitrite, and peroxynitrite, which do not share the vasodilatory properties of NO and can be toxic [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p>While much attention has been paid to the role of hemolysis in the pathogenesis of PH in SCD, it is likely that other factors (eg, the impact of local hypoxia on vascular remodeling, genetic variability, and thrombosis) play a role in pathogenesis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H879456977"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of PH is difficult in patients with SCD because of the many potential causes of dyspnea in SCD. As an example, both PH and worsening anemia can produce exertional dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, light-headedness, and syncope/near-syncope in patients with SCD. Chest pain is not uncommon during vaso-occlusive pain episodes and may be difficult to link to potential PH, especially in patients with SCD who have chronic pain.</p><p>Common PH symptoms, including dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, chest pain, lower extremity edema, syncope or near-syncope, and palpitations, may be observed in SCD patients with or without PH. On the other hand, patients with SCD may not report dyspnea on exertion because they ascribe the symptom to anemia or deconditioning. Sometimes, careful questioning is needed to elicit a history of dyspnea  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94508" href="/d/graphic/94508.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1436.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with dyspnea"</a>.)</p><p>Physical examination may reveal findings consistent with those observed in PH patients without SCD, such as a pronounced pulmonic component of the second heart sound. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H879456983"><span class="h1">SCREENING AND RISK STRATIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rationale for screening SCD patients for PH stems from the link between an elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) on Doppler echocardiography and mortality in SCD, although this remains an area of controversy and further research is needed to clarify the optimal approach for early detection of PH [<a href="#rid1">1,31,32</a>]. While outcomes studies have not identified a benefit from screening, risk stratification based on TRV helps to guide clinical decision making. An elevated TRV measured by Doppler echocardiography identifies adults with SCD who are at increased risk for mortality [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]; in children ≥8 years old, an elevated TRV identifies those at greater future risk for reduced exercise capacity [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17234.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension in children: Classification, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Given the often delayed appearance of symptoms and the increased morbidity and mortality risks associated with elevated pulmonary pressures by echocardiogram (regardless of a PH diagnosis), our practice, consistent with guidelines from the American Thoracic Society, is to screen patients with SCD as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509" href="/d/graphic/94509.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A one-time transthoracic Doppler echocardiogram is suggested in asymptomatic children with SCD who are aged 8 to 18 years old (possibly sooner in those with severe hemolytic anemia) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Based on the TRV result, the patient may require additional evaluation as described below and in the algorithm. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation for PH'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Once individuals with SCD reach adulthood (18 years of age), Doppler echocardiography is recommended every one to three years, using the shorter intervals for those with respiratory symptoms, TRV ≥2.5 m/sec on prior echocardiogram, greater frequency of pain episodes, prior thromboembolic events, or greater severity of hemolytic anemia [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p>An expert panel from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for PH in asymptomatic individuals with SCD; however, the panel emphasized the importance of evaluating symptoms suggestive of PH (eg, exercise intolerance, fatigue, peripheral edema, chest pain) with echocardiography [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. The American Society of Hematology guidelines advise against routine echocardiography for screening but support a comprehensive assessment for symptoms and signs that might be clues to the development of PH (eg, dyspnea or chest pain at rest or with exertion, exercise limitation, syncope or presyncope, sleep-disordered breathing, history of venous thromboembolism, hypoxemia at rest or with exertion) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H879456989"><span class="h1">EVALUATION FOR PH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PH is typically suspected in SCD patients who have exertional dyspnea, oxygen desaturation, more severe hemolytic anemia, or elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV; ≥2.5 m/sec) on screening echocardiography [<a href="#rid24">24,34,37</a>]. The ability of echocardiography to predict PH increases with increasing TRV. A TRV between 2.5 and 3 m/sec identifies only 31 percent of patients with a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥25 mmHg, whereas a TRV ≥3 m/sec identifies approximately 66 to 77 percent of patients with PH [<a href="#rid7">7,11,12</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of patients with these findings includes pulmonary function tests with a diffusing capacity, ventilation/perfusion scanning, a six-minute walk test (6MWT), N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in those who have not had a recent study [<a href="#rid1">1,7,14,38,39</a>]. However, none of these noninvasive tests is diagnostic for PH; a right heart catheterization (RHC) is required for diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509" href="/d/graphic/94509.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The following discussion reviews the accuracy of these tests for identifying PH and the interpretation of the results in patients with SCD. The role of these studies in the evaluation of PH from other etiologies is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Initial diagnostic evaluation (noninvasive testing)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H278927319"><span class="h2">Transthoracic doppler echocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Doppler echocardiography provides an estimate of pulmonary artery and right ventricular systolic pressures via the TRV, and assesses left and right ventricular size, thickness, and function. Although much attention has been given to the association of a TRV of ≥2.5 m/sec with increased mortality risk in SCD [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], each component of the echocardiogram helps to inform the clinician of PH risk [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1">A prospective French study performed echocardiography on 398 SCD adults, of whom 96 underwent RHC [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. An elevated TRV was noted in 27 percent, but only 6 percent had PH confirmed by right heart catheterization. Using a TRV of &gt;2.9 m/sec increased the positive predictive value to 64 percent but also increased the false negative rate to 42 percent. This false negative rate was improved by using a 6 minute walk distance of &lt;333 meters and an NT-pro-BNP level &gt;164.5 pg/mL. A 2016 meta-analysis of the studies with RHC and echocardiographic data revealed that 53 of 173 patients (31 percent) with a TRV &gt;2.5 m/sec actually had PH, confirming the low positive predictive value of transthoracic Doppler echocardiography [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Elevated pulmonary artery pressures are also noted in children, particularly those with more severe hemolysis and/or frequent episodes of acute chest syndrome (ACS), and are associated with a subsequent decline in exercise tolerance [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The PUSH trial demonstrated that children and adolescents with an elevated TRV and a high hemolytic component were at highest risk for a decreased 6MWT after two years of follow-up [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with a TRV ≥3 m/sec, we proceed to RHC  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509" href="/d/graphic/94509.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). For patients with a TRV 2.5 to 2.9 m/sec, we proceed to RHC if there are other findings suggestive of PH, such as symptoms or physical signs including unexplained hypoxemia, a decreased 6MWT distance, or an elevated NT-pro-BNP. In the absence of these other findings, we increase the frequency of subsequent Doppler echocardiograms to annually. These criteria are slightly different from those used for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our preference to use 2.5 m/sec as the TRV to consider RHC is based upon an increased mortality associated with this finding in SCD patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1550181268"><span class="h2">N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Plasma concentrations of NT-pro-BNP are typically elevated in patients with PH and correlate with severity; similar findings pertain in SCD.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">Two studies evaluated the use of NT-pro-BNP to assess for PH and mortality risk in SCD. One study included two separate cohorts of consecutive SCD adults [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In one cohort, the degree of NT-pro-BNP elevation correlated with mortality; among patients with NT-pro-BNP levels of ≤30 pg/mL, 31 to 159 pg/mL, and ≥160 pg/mL, respectively, mortality was 6, 7, and 26 percent. The mortality risk among adults with an NT-pro-BNP level ≥160 pg/mL was 5.1 (95% CI 2.1-12.5) times greater than that observed among patients with a NT-pro-BNP level &lt;160 pg/mL. In the other cohort, the degree of NT-pro-BNP elevation also correlated with mortality; among patients with NT-pro-BNP levels of ≤30 pg/mL, 31 to 159 pg/mL, and ≥160 pg/mL, respectively, mortality was 6, 17, and 49 percent. The risk of mortality was 2.9 (95% CI 1.2-6.6) times greater among patients with an NT-pro-BNP level ≥160 pg/mL compared with those with lower levels [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. These findings were confirmed by a study of 330 adults recruited as part of the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, in which an NT-pro-BNP level ≥160 pg/mL was associated with a relative risk of death of 6.24 (95% CI 2.9-13.3) compared with those with lower levels [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].

In a longitudinal study, 84 patients with PH due to SCD were followed for a median time of 4.7 years [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. The following were identified as hemodynamic risk factors for mortality: mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP; hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% CI 1.05-2.45 per 10 mmHg increase), diastolic PAP (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.09-3.08 per 10 mmHg increase), diastolic PAP - pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.23-3.89 per 10 mmHg increase), transpulmonary gradient (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.14-2.79 per 10 mmHg increase), and pulmonary vascular resistance (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.89 per Wood unit increase). These data suggest that the greater the degree of precapillary PH, the worse the prognosis.</p><p>Although only a portion of patients with an elevated TRV or N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide level alone have PH, each of these factors predicts mortality in SCD adults [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. One possible explanation for this observation is the association between an elevated TRV and relative systemic hypertension, lower extremity ulcers, and kidney disease, suggesting the presence of a more diffuse systemic vasculopathy in these patients [<a href="#rid64">64</a>].</p><p>While an elevated TRV is not associated with a higher mortality in children with SCD, longitudinal follow-up of 160 children and adolescents with SCD demonstrated a reduction in exercise capacity (decreased six-minute walk distance) over 22 months in those with an elevated TRV [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This observation suggests that children with SCD and an elevated TRV may be at increased risk of cardiopulmonary decline. At this time, we do not know whether early identification and treatment of patients with SCD and elevated TRV without PH improves survival.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4247966320"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

PH is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in SCD. The prevalence of PH in SCD is estimated to be between 6 and 10.5 percent. (See <a class="local">'Classification'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – Patients with SCD may not report dyspnea on exertion, as they may ascribe the symptom to anemia or deconditioning. Careful questioning may be needed to elicit a history of dyspnea  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94508" href="/d/graphic/94508.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Screening and risk stratification</strong> – As symptom recognition is often delayed in PH complicating SCD, we obtain a baseline transthoracic Doppler echocardiogram in children ≥8 years old and perform Doppler echocardiogram in adults every one to three years, although this is controversial and evidence is lacking. A tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) of ≥2.5 m/sec is indicative of increased mortality risk and requires further evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509" href="/d/graphic/94509.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Screening and risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – Our approach includes (see <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>PH may be suspected based on exertional dyspnea and noninvasive testing (eg, TRV ≥2.5 m/sec, N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide ≥160 pg/mL, six-minute walk distance less than 333 m).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Definitive diagnosis requires right heart catheterization (RHC) that identifies a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;20 mmHg. RHC is also used to differentiate precapillary PH with a normal pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP ≤15 mmHg) from postcapillary PH with an elevated PAOP (&gt;15 mmHg).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Once PH is diagnosed, further evaluation is needed to identify any contributors to PH that might require focused treatment, such as hypoxemia due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in situ thrombosis, venous thromboembolism (VTE), HIV infection, or portal hypertension  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509" href="/d/graphic/94509.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). We typically obtain laboratory testing (liver function tests, antinuclear antibody, HIV serology), pulmonary function testing, a radionuclide ventilation-perfusion scan, and polysomnography.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – Treatment includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Supportive treatment for precapillary PH in SCD includes supplemental oxygen and diuretics, as well as treatment of sleep disordered breathing, VTE, and other disease modulators.

For patients with PE, we suggest indefinite anticoagulant therapy rather than a limited duration of therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Anticoagulation may need to be reduced for patients with major bleeding risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Long-term anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with SCD and PH by RHC or a TRV of ≥2.5 m/sec, we recommend treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). In practice, most patients with SCD should already be taking hydroxyurea. Chronic transfusion therapy is an alternative for patients who are unable to take hydroxyurea or whose disease does not respond.

For patients with moderate disease (WHO class II to III), we typically initiate therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist; for patients with advanced disease (WHO class IV), we typically initiate therapy with a prostanoid following guidelines for other forms of PH. We avoid phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in SCD due to a possible increase in the frequency of vaso-occlusive pain.
