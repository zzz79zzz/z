         Weight loss is often seen in the first week of life, with healthy newborns losing 7 to 10 percent of their birth weight as milk production is established in the first 72 hours postpartum. Neonates typically regain that weight by two weeks of life, with most gaining approximately 1 ounce (30 grams) per day. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2845.html" rel="external">
          "Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children", section on 'Typical milestones'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ongoing weight loss in young infants is commonly caused by acute infection, problems with feeding, milk protein allergy, malnutrition, or failure to thrive. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, pyloric stenosis, and child neglect are other frequent etiologies. Dehydration associated with any etiology can be severe.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although less common, other life-threatening conditions include intestinal malrotation with volvulus, congenital heart disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and inborn errors of metabolism. A careful, thorough history and physical examination, in conjunction with the judicious use of laboratory tests, will often reveal the cause.

         The major components of weight include water, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Weight loss occurs when the daily balance of one or several of these components becomes negative. During infancy and early childhood, major causes of weight loss include inadequate calorie intake to meets the energy demands of the child's metabolism for daily activity and growth, or negative fluid balance. Specific etiologies include (see

         Severe dehydration from acute gastroenteritis can lead to significant weight loss from fluid losses. Dehydration from gastroenteritis is one of the leading causes of death among infants in developing nations. Infants with acute gastroenteritis typically present with acute onset of diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and decreased feeding. Blood or mucous in the stool or rice water stool suggest bacterial enteritis or cholera, respectively. Dehydration may also occur due to other acute infections (eg, pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infection), conditions causing decreased intake (eg, feeding disorders, congenital heart disease, child neglect, malnutrition) or conditions associated with increased loses (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pyloric stenosis, milk protein allergy with diarrhea, or intestinal malabsorption). Findings of significant dehydration (eg, prolonged capillary refill, dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes or fontanelle, or lethargy) are commonly found on physical examination. (See

         Rotational anomalies occur as a result of an arrest of normal rotation of the embryonic gut. Volvulus occurs when small bowel twists around the superior mesenteric artery resulting in vascular compromise to large portions of the midgut  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78111" href="/z/d/graphic/78111.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Most children with intestinal malrotation develop signs of acute small bowel obstruction in early infancy. Intestinal malrotation should be suspected in any infant with bilious vomiting. Physical examination may reveal mild distension of the abdomen, diffuse tenderness with or without signs of peritonitis, and bloody stool on rectal examination. Blood in the stool is a worrisome sign, since it suggests bowel ischemia and possible necrosis from volvulus. Third space fluid losses and sepsis, caused by necrotic bowel, can cause rapidly progressive cardiovascular compromise. Prompt fluid resuscitation and surgical intervention are essential. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6477.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         If the child is hemodynamically stable, the diagnosis should be confirmed by radiologic evaluation. This evaluation typically begins with plain radiographs, which are rarely diagnostic, but are important to exclude obvious perforation indicated by pneumoperitoneum. Plain radiographs are followed by an upper gastrointestinal contrast series, which is the best examination to visualize the duodenum in infants and children. It should be performed, whenever possible, under fluoroscopy by an experienced pediatric radiologist. (See

         Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital disorder in newborns; ventricular septal defects account for approximately half of malformations. Infants with congenital heart disease frequently have difficulty feeding with resulting weight loss from dehydration or protein-calorie malnutrition. Though cyanotic and ductal dependent heart lesions are typically diagnosed perinatally and up to two weeks of age, many cardiac lesions (eg, structural lesions, cardiomyopathies, and cardiac tumors) may present later in infancy with weight loss or poor weight gain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5774.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In affected infants, parents/caregivers most commonly notice difficulty with feeding. This may be manifested by intake of a limited volume of milk. Feedings may also take too long due to frequent interruption by sleeping or resting, choking, gagging, and/or vomiting. Infants may have respiratory distress that is reported by caregivers as fast or hard breathing, worse with feedings, or a persistent cough or wheeze. Other manifestations include color changes, such as central cyanosis or persistent pallor; excessive sweating that is increased with feeding and occurs during sleep, decreased activity, or excessive sleeping. Physical examination may demonstrate a cardiac murmur, gallop, or decreased pulses in the lower extremities. Electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, echocardiogram and consultation with a pediatric cardiologist should be performed for any infant in whom congenital heart disease is suspected. (See

         Inherited defects in the enzymatic steps of cortisol biosynthesis (steroidogenesis) result in disease states termed congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609" href="/z/d/graphic/79609.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). These disorders cause primary adrenal insufficiency because they impair cortisol synthesis  (

          table 2

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         CYP21A2 (21-hydroxylase) deficiency is the most common form of CAH  (

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). It accounts for more than 95 percent of cases of adrenal steroidogenic defects, and is estimated to occur in one in 14,200 live births. CYP21A2 deficiency usually presents as one of two clinical syndromes in neonates or very young infants, both of which are associated with glucocorticoid deficiency: a salt-wasting form (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension on account of mineralocorticoid deficiency) with ambiguous genitalia in affected females (because of adrenal androgen excess), and a simple virilizing form in affected males and females without salt wasting. In some infants, the distinction between the two forms is not clear. Adrenal crisis with circulatory collapse may occur within the first few days to weeks of life. In the United States, 21-hydroxylase deficiency is part of the newborn screen in all states, so most affected infants are diagnosed prior to developing adrenal crisis. (See

This weight loss is associated with laboratory abnormalities (eg, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, or hyperammonemia). Additional findings may include lethargy, coma, seizures, and abnormal odors. Partial or mild defects may present with a milder course and in later childhood. (See

         Patients with underlying acute infections can present with weight loss due to decreased ability to feed in conjunction with increased metabolic needs. Young infants often present with lethargy or decreased activity, fever, hypothermia, or respiratory distress due to a variety of illnesses including sepsis, bronchiolitis or other viral infections, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia.

Premature infants, children with anatomic malformations of the oropharynx or esophagus (eg, cleft lip and palate or tracheo-esophageal fistula), neuromuscular weakness including infant botulism, or chronic neurologic disorders (eg, cerebral palsy or neuromuscular weakness) are at highest risk.

         Prematurely born infants and those requiring prolonged endotracheal intubation early in life may be at increased risk of having oral aversion. Some infants become extremely sensitive to certain textures and may refuse food intake. This aversion can range from a mild intolerance to textured foods to a complete refusal to take anything by mouth. A psychologist, speech therapist, or occupational therapist experienced in working with feeding disorders should be consulted as soon as a problem when oral aversion is suspected. A thorough evaluation will be needed to establish the range of factors involved and to rule out unidentified physiological problems. (See

         Patients with neuromuscular disease may present with poor weight gain or weight loss in association with generalized weakness, hypotonia, and feeding difficulty. Problems with sucking and swallowing are common in infants with central nervous system or neuromuscular disorders. In addition, difficulty maintaining airway patency and clearing secretions can predispose these patients to recurrent respiratory infections, which increases metabolic demand. Patients with significant disease must often maintain long term daily nutritional requirements through feeding tubes or parenteral supplementation. (See

         Gastroesophageal reflux is common in infants and is usually not pathological. Regurgitation is present in 50 to 70 percent of all infants, peaks at age four months, and typically resolves by one year. In contrast, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the reflux episodes are associated with symptoms or complications. A small minority of infants with GERD develop other symptoms, including feeding refusal, irritability possibly secondary to pain during eating, hematemesis, anemia, respiratory symptoms, and failure to thrive. Decreased food intake without any other complaints may be a symptom of esophagitis in infants, which can cause weight loss. In some infants, the pain of esophagitis causes arching of the back, extension of the neck, and turning of the head to the side in associated with regurgitation or choking (Sandifer syndrome). Color change (pallor or cyanosis) may also occur. These episodes may be mistaken for seizures, apnea, or dystonia. GERD is a clinical diagnosis. In patients who do not respond to treatment, upper endoscopy with biopsy of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum may be indicated. (See

         Patients with pyloric stenosis may present to the ED with dehydration and acute weight loss due to persistent vomiting. The classic presentation is a three to six-week-old first-born male infant who develops immediate postprandial, non-bilious, often projectile vomiting and demands to be re-fed soon afterwards (a "hungry vomiter"). Vomiting may be less forceful in premature infants and those with central nervous system anomalies or cleft lip and palate. Significant dehydration with hemodynamic instability can occur. Laboratory evaluation classically shows a hypochloremic, metabolic alkalosis resulting from the loss of large amounts of gastric hydrochloric acid. The severity of these laboratory abnormalities depends upon the duration of symptoms prior to initial evaluation. Diagnosis is made by palpation of the hypertrophic pylorus or by demonstration of characteristic findings on ultrasound or an upper gastrointestinal study with contrast swallow. (See

The manifestations of infant neglect leading to weight loss may include starvation or dehydration due to inadequate provision of food and water, poor hygiene of an infant's body, failure to provide for the infant's medical needs, and physical abuse.

         Cow's milk protein allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy in young infants and children, affecting about two percent of all children under four years of age. Clinical symptoms of cow's milk protein allergy frequently appear during the first few months of life, often within days or weeks after the introduction of a cow's milk-based formula into the diet, although symptoms may also occur with exclusive breastfeeding if the mother ingests cow's milk. Patients typically present with weight loss in association with vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, and/or bloody stools though patients can also present with atopy, anaphylaxis, or more severe gastrointestinal disease  (

         The diagnosis of CMA is based upon the history and laboratory testing, when available (diagnostic tests for non-IgE-mediated manifestations of CMA are limited). The gold-standard for diagnosis is a clinician-supervised double-blind, placebo controlled oral food challenge, although an open challenge will often suffice. Measurement of cow's milk-specific IgE can aid in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated CMA and may eliminate the need for oral food challenges. (See

         A detailed social history can often reveal poverty and economic stressors as potential contributors to weight loss from lack of resources. Infants may present with weight loss or poor weight gain because of decreased intake due to the inability to acquire adequate amounts of nutrition and chronic conditions that are due to poor food availability [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         ]. Likewise, parents/caregivers may choose a specific diet (vegetarian, vegan, etc) to fit their family goals. While a completely plant-based diet is potentially suitable during all stages of life, it must be well-planned to avoid malnutrition and deficiencies in a growing infant. (See

         – Infants with primary immunodeficiency often have poor weight gain or weight loss. This is particularly true in the presence of oral ulcers, candidiasis, or chronic diarrhea. Almost three-fourths of the primary immunodeficiencies are caused by an antibody (B cell) deficiency or a combined antibody plus cellular (T cell) abnormality  (

         ). Isolated T cell defects, as well as phagocytic cell, complement, and other innate immune defects, are much less common. Thus, B cell (antibody) or combined B and T cell diseases should be considered initially, unless clinical features suggest otherwise. Recurrent infections comprise the most common clinical findings. The type and pattern of recurring infections depend upon which components of the immune system are affected  (

         Infants with ill appearance require timely resuscitation and treatment of dehydration and shock as needed. In addition to acute infection, these patients should be carefully assessed for findings of congenital heart disease, intestinal malrotation with volvulus, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, inborn error of metabolism, and malignancy. In patients with early presentations of some diseases that usually cause significant illness, such as malrotation or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, appearance may be normal.

         Poor feeding, child abuse and neglect, pyloric stenosis and gastroenteritis are common conditions causing dehydration. In patients with these conditions, dehydration may be severe and cause ill appearance.

         The goal of the evaluation of a young infant with weight loss is to identify any signs and symptoms of underlying disease, especially congenital disease, or potential psychosocial factors, primarily child neglect, that may be involved. In the stable, relatively well-appearing patient, a careful, thorough history and physical examination, in conjunction with the judicious use of laboratory tests will often reveal the cause. Laboratory investigation is unlikely to reveal an organic cause in the absence of suggestive evidence from the initial history or physical examination.

          Persistent, moderate weight loss
         </strong>
         – Young infants with weight loss persisting over one to two weeks without severe decompensation warrant a careful feeding history as well as questioning about regurgitation, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, steatorrhea, and acholic stools. The clinician should also review the perinatal history with a focus on gestational age at birth, exposure to TORCH infections (eg, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, or herpes simplex virus infection), and any concern for congenital malformations at birth or by prenatal ultrasound screening. If the patient is fed using powdered formula or other preparations that are not "ready-to-feed," the clinician should assess whether the caregiver is properly mixing the formula.

         Additionally, ankyloglossia or "tongue-tie" can lead to weight loss in breastfed infants. If unable to move the nipple into correct position, the infant might chew instead of suck on the nipple, causing significant discomfort and interfering in breastmilk delivery. Ultimately, poor breastfeeding can lead to inadequate nutrition and failure to thrive and is an indication for surgical management if conservative measures fail. (See

          Diagnostic approach
         </strong>
         – Weight loss in young infants is an important finding that may arise from a variety of conditions  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). A careful, thorough history and physical examination in conjunction with the judicious use of laboratory tests will often reveal the cause. The diagnostic approach to weight loss in the infant six months of age and younger is summarized in the algorithm  (

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – During physical examination, the weight should be obtained and compared with prior measurements along with length and head circumference. These measurements should be plotted on the appropriate growth chart and compared with any previously available measurements to assess for rate of loss and changes in weight percentile (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2845.html" rel="external">
          "Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children", section on 'Growth charts'
         </a>
         ). Failure of adequate growth in head circumference in association with weight loss is of particular concern in young infants. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physical examination'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Direct observation of the infant feeding frequently provides important information regarding the cause of weight loss. Any accompanying respiratory distress, sweating, or choking with feeds should be noted as they may be associated with an underlying cause of poor weight gain. Additionally, any difficulty with breastfeeding, infant latch, painful nipples, or mastitis should be noted. (See
