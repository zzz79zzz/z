Interventions directed at reducing complications of hemophilia and its treatment are paramount. At the same time, routine health maintenance and comprehensive care is critical to decrease other health risks that have the potential to become more complicated due to the underlying bleeding disorder.</p><p>Integrated care should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis of hemophilia is made [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This includes decisions about prophylaxis with factor concentrates or other therapeutics, methods to minimize bleeding risk, and counseling regarding psychosocial issues and disease inheritance. Education about the disease is important for families and caregivers, especially those with newborns with a new hemophilia diagnosis, since the newborn will be the first person with hemophilia in approximately one-third of kindreds.

The multidisciplinary team provides coordinated chronic disease management and expert hemophilia care, risk reduction counseling, and ongoing education of patients and families. HTCs also manage physical therapy, social work, genetic counseling, home therapy and preventive services, and more, and they work closely with hemophilia consumer organizations.</p><p>The benefit of HTCs was demonstrated in a 2000 study that compared mortality in 2950 individuals with hemophilia (7575 person-years of observation) according to the site of care (HTC or non-HTC) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This study documented a significant improvement in life expectancy associated with HTC-based care (relative risk [RR] of death 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) despite HTCs caring for a population with more severe disease and associated co-morbidities.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2514183300"><span class="h2">Newborn care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of infants with hemophilia present with a known family history; advance noninvasive fetal sex determination is used to guide labor and delivery. However, a sizable minority of affected individuals have an unexpected diagnosis, either due to a de novo mutation in the mother, or lack of transmission of knowledge of risk or genetic analysis of at-risk individuals within a family.

Circumcision is a controversial and an individual or important decision for some families and is a religious ritual for certain groups such as Muslims and Jews [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. An approach to this and other invasive procedures if the patient is diagnosed with hemophilia is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1314.html" rel="external">"Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B", section on 'Circumcision'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnostic testing for the relevant factor level (factor VIII [8] for hemophilia A or factor IX [9] for hemophilia B) is performed using cord blood (preferred) or a venous sample, with comparison to age-appropriate normal controls. In cases without a family history, von Willebrand factor antigen is also required in addition to the factor VIII level since von Willebrand disease (VWD) is also in the differential diagnosis. Some individuals with mild factor VIII deficiency may require repeat testing, since factor VIII is increased at birth and a mild deficiency may be missed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1310.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H636230538"><span class="h2">Immunizations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recommended immunizations should be given at age-appropriate intervals to individuals with hemophilia. </p><p>Modifications to reduce the risk of bleeding include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For individuals receiving factor prophylaxis, timing the vaccine to occur when factor levels are high (soon after factor administration) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This does not apply to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">emicizumab</a>, since the steady state level is more consistent.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limiting the number of injections per limb.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of the smallest gauge needle.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Application of pressure and/or ice to the site for three to five minutes post injection.

In a series of 29 children who received 64 doses of an intramuscular vaccine without factor or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115772" href="/z/d/drug information/115772.html" rel="external">emicizumab</a> prophylaxis, there were no bleeding episodes [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. An associated literature review of 702 intramuscular vaccines, there were 17 instances of bleeding after vaccination, one of which required factor treatment. Bleeding was most likely in adults &gt;50 years. Based on their findings, the authors concluded that infants could receive intramuscular vaccines without prophylaxis. </p><p>Standard vaccination schedules and other issues such as avoidance of live vaccines when there is an immunocompromised member of the household, are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2695.html" rel="external">"Poliovirus vaccination"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2876.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview", section on 'Routine schedule'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3652764549"><span class="h2">Dental care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Appropriate oral hygiene and regular dental care is essential for individuals with hemophilia to prevent gingival and dental disease, which increase the risk of bleeding. Early infant dental intervention is recommended to teach proper brushing and ensure adequate household water fluoridation. The teeth should be cleaned routinely, and anticipated problem areas that may cause bleeding should be discussed. An example is frenulum injury as a cause of bleeding in young children. Management of dental procedures is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1314.html" rel="external">"Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4009537745"><span class="h2">Exercise and athletic participation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An appropriate exercise regimen should be encouraged as a daily routine. Benefits include maintenance of a healthy weight, cardiovascular risk reduction, and positive effects on strength, flexibility, balance, and bone density, all of which contribute to decreased stress on joints. Exercise is also valuable for socialization and psychological health, which may be affected by a chronic condition such as hemophilia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Children with hemophilia are vulnerable to loss of physical conditioning, reduced bone density, and excessive weight gain/obesity due to activity restrictions [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The role of an exercise program is best discussed early to support positive lifelong habits and health.</p><p>The World Federation of Haemophilia Working Group on Physical Therapy and the National Hemophilia Foundation Physical Therapy Committee have developed patient educational materials that quantify some of the musculoskeletal benefits and risks of organized and individual physical exercise [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The best approach to defining individual athletic regimens involves consultation between the staff at a local HTC; the patient; and for minor children, the parents and caregivers.</p><p>Ideal activities are those that reflect the individual's preferences, abilities, and local resources, and include non-contact sports such as swimming, walking, golf, tennis, bicycling, archery, and table tennis, and supervised group activities [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In one series of 37 children with severe hemophilia A or B who were receiving prophylactic factor infusions, the frequency of joint bleeding was low (&lt;1 bleed or injury per season) and did not differ between high impact activities (eg, basketball, karate, skateboarding) and low impact activities (eg, cycling, swimming, hiking) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Examples of high and low impact sports are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109841" href="/z/d/graphic/109841.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Consultation with a specialist regarding protective gear, splints, and prophylactic factor infusions timed around the activities should be initiated early and as needed. Additional information about specific activities is provided in a publication from the National Hemophilia Foundation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1642303544"><span class="h2">Medicines to avoid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medicines that increase the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should generally be avoided in patients with hemophilia. Pain can be treated with local measures (eg, cold packs, immobilization, splinting), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9291" href="/z/d/drug information/9291.html" rel="external">codeine</a>. Cardiovascular disease prevention should focus on diet, exercise, smoking avoidance, and control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>Use of antithrombotic drugs may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding in patients with hemophilia. Therefore, their use should only be instituted in consultation with a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center. Selected examples include the following, but this is not an exhaustive list.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with cardiovascular disease may be treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or an anticoagulant if the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks, with consideration given to institution of a factor replacement regimen that provides protection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110258.html" rel="external">"Chronic complications and age-related comorbidities in people with hemophilia", section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some patients with arthropathy can use cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">"Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>It is also important to discuss herbal remedies and over-the-counter supplements such as fish oil, which may increase bleeding risk and are not always volunteered by the patient [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. These may not need to be strictly avoided, but the physician should be aware of their use and have a discussion about the possible impact on bleeding risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3618317843"><span class="h2">Planning for invasive procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For individuals with hemophilia who are undergoing elective surgery, collaboration between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, hematologist, and laboratory and transfusion medicine services should occur, with sufficient time to allow a smooth surgical course in which factor levels can be monitored and replacement therapy administered on time. The specific factor dosing schedule, appropriate target factor levels, and duration of therapy depend on the individual patient and procedure being performed; some individuals may be able to use products other than clotting factor (eg, DDAVP for mild hemophilia A). These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1314.html" rel="external">"Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H901872873"><span class="h2">DDAVP test dose for mild hemophilia A</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>DDAVP (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/z/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">desmopressin</a>) is a synthetic analog of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) that promotes release of factor VIII and its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) from storage pools in platelet granules and endothelial cells. For individuals with mild hemophilia A (factor VIII activity level between 5 and 40 percent), a DDAVP test dose can be given to determine whether DDAVP is effective in that individual, and if so, whether it can be used to raise the factor VIII level in the setting of mild bleeding or invasive procedures. This should be done at least one week before a planned procedure, since tachyphylaxis occurs. Usually it is done as part of routine comprehensive care so that DDAVP can be used for a variety of mild bleeding scenarios, including surgical, traumatic, or spontaneous. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1314.html" rel="external">"Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B", section on 'Patient with mild hemophilia'</a>.)</p><p>The DDAVP test dose should be performed when the individual is well. It involves a baseline measurement of factor VIII activity level, followed by administration of DDAVP, followed by measurement of a post-DDAVP factor VIII activity level. DDAVP can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or intranasally (with a nasal spray).</p><p>Dosing and post-DDAVP factor VIII level measurement is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intravenous DDAVP</strong> – Give 0.3 mcg/kg (maximum dose, 20 to 30 mcg). The intravenous form is diluted in 50 mL of normal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> and infused over 20 to 30 minutes. Obtain the post-DDAVP factor VIII level approximately 60 minutes after DDAVP administration. The dose maximum of 20 to 30 mcg is commonly used in the United States due to concerns about increasing toxicity and diminishing efficacy at higher doses, although there are no data directly comparing different dose caps in a large sample of patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subcutaneous DDAVP</strong> – Give 0.3 mcg/kg (maximum dose, 20 to 30 mcg), divided so that no injection is &gt;2 mL. The injections are given in the subcutaneous tissue of the lower abdomen, anterior thigh, or deltoid, using a 30-gauge needle(s). Pressure should be applied to each injection site for 2 to 5 minutes. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intranasal DDAVP</strong> – When using the nasal spray, it is important to use the product intended for hemostatic therapy (Stimate) rather than the product for enuresis, since the dose is higher for bleeding disorders (1.5 mg/mL rather than 0.01 percent). Give one puff (150 mcg in one nostril) in patients weighing &lt;50 kg and two puffs (150 mcg in both nostrils) in patients weighing ≥50 kg. Obtain the post-DDAVP factor VIII level approximately 90 minutes after DDAVP administration.</p><p></p><p>Factor VIII activity levels are checked 90 minutes after the start of intravenous administration (60 minutes after completion of the infusion) or 90 minutes after subcutaneous injection.</p><p>In individuals for whom this is effective, an approximately two- to fourfold increase in factor VIII activity level is expected at approximately 60 minutes after an infusion or 90 minutes after an intranasal dose, with the response persisting for 6 to 12 hours [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Some individuals have a lower or greater increase. </p><p>Additional doses may be given; however, tachyphylaxis (waning efficacy with multiple infusions) may occur with repeated dosing, and dosing at intervals shorter than 24 hours may be associated with increased risk of water retention. One study of serial DDAVP doses (one dose per day) found a 30 percent lower peak level in factor VIII increase between the first and second doses of DDAVP [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>The likelihood of response to DDAVP has been assessed in several case series. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a review of intravenous DDAVP test doses given to 62 boys with mild hemophilia A at one institution, 29 (47 percent) had at least a twofold increase in factor VIII level one hour after administration of DDAVP [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The likelihood of response was greatest in those with higher baseline factor levels and with increasing age; an additional seven boys who did not have an initial response and were retested approximately five years later did have a response upon retesting. Another report that included 20 patients with mild hemophilia A documented DDAVP responses in 75 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 22 individuals (11 with hemophilia A and 11 with von Willebrand disease [VWD]) who had a documented response to intravenous DDAVP at 60 minutes and were subsequently tested for the response to intranasal DDAVP (Stimate) at 90 minutes, all of the patients with hemophilia A had increases in factor VIII levels (median increment of 30 percent [from 17±11 percent to 50±25 percent]) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This was less than the median increment with intravenous DDAVP of 62 percent, but 9 of 11 had a final factor VIII level above 20 percent, which is minimally hemostatic in specific instances. A study in 10 volunteers without hemophilia documented that intravenous and intranasal DDAVP produced similar responses, supporting the usefulness of the intranasal route [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p>DDAVP is generally reserved for minor bleeding or minor invasive procedures in individuals with mild hemophilia A. Severe, life-threatening bleeding should be treated with factor infusion because the response to DDAVP is not immediate and may not raise the factor VIII level for optimal hemostasis. Individuals with moderate to severe hemophilia A (factor VIII level &lt;5 percent) are unlikely to derive benefit from DDAVP because the incremental increase in factor VIII level would be insufficient for hemostasis. Rarely, an individual with a factor VIII level in the moderately deficient range (ie, levels near 5 percent) might be able to use DDAVP if they prefer, as long as testing demonstrates an adequate DDAVP response.

Mild or moderate factor deficiency with a decreased clinical bleeding phenotype may be important decision-making points favoring on-demand therapy (factor given only in the setting of acute bleeding or surgery, also called episodic therapy). Individuals may decide to change from on-demand to prophylactic therapy (or vice versa) based on the perceived burden, their activity level, and their overall health status.</p><p>The terminology for prophylaxis was revised in the 2012 World Federation of Hemophilia guideline to clarify whether prophylaxis is primary (before a bleeding event has occurred) or secondary, and continuous or intermittent (eg, for a few months at a time)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109728" href="/z/d/graphic/109728.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary prophylaxis</strong> – Individuals who have not had a bleeding episode but are at high risk of bleeding based on severe factor deficiency (eg, factor VIII or factor IX activity level &lt;1 percent) are recommended to receive primary prophylaxis due to the high risk of spontaneous bleeding and efficacy of prophylaxis in preventing bleeding and its complications [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Primary prophylaxis has been used extensively in parts of Europe, particularly in Sweden, and has been accepted by the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) of the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) and the Pediatric Working Party of the United Kingdom Haemophilia Doctors' Organisation (UKHDO) as the optimal treatment modality for patients with severe hemophilia [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary prophylaxis</strong> – For individuals who have had more than one bleeding episode (eg, two or more bleeds into a target joint, evidence of joint disease by physical examination or radiography), secondary prophylaxis may be appropriate to prevent further morbidity, regardless of factor activity level.

Intermittent prophylaxis (also called "short-term prophylaxis"), which is administered for several weeks to months and then discontinued, may be used in specific circumstances such as high-impact physical activities, joint bleeding, or surgical procedures. We are more likely to use prophylaxis in those with lower baseline factor levels (closer to 5 percent) and in those with moderate factor VIII deficiency than those with moderate factor IX deficiency, but the individual bleeding phenotype must be considered in decision-making.</p><p></p><p>Many individuals for whom prophylaxis is appropriate may not have access to factor infusions due to high costs and/or lack of resources. In resource-limited settings, options for those who cannot receive regular prophylaxis include intermittent prophylaxis and/or prophylaxis using lower doses. As an example, a 2016 study from India of patients with factor VIII deficiency found that prophylaxis using factor VIII at 10 units/kg (rather than the usual 25 to 40 units/kg) twice per week was cost-effective and significantly reduced joint bleeds and school absenteeism [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>Evidence for the benefit of prophylaxis in reducing morbidity comes from randomized trials and observational studies, as well as experience with individuals who have factor activity levels above 1 to 2 percent and have significantly lower bleeding rates than those with factor levels &lt;1 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2007 trial randomly assigned 65 boys with hemophilia A (factor VIII activity &lt;2 percent) who were under 30 months of age to receive prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (25 units/kg every other day) or episodic therapy only at the time of joint bleeding [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].
