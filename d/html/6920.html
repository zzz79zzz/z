         Smoking is associated with the development of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other diseases. Most adults who smoke want to quit smoking [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Discontinuing smoking is an important goal for patients, and each year approximately two out of every three people who smoke in the United States make an attempt to quit [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. One-half of people who have ever smoked have been able to quit. Additionally, older individuals are less likely to attempt to quit and, accordingly, less likely to be advised to quit [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Quitting smoking may be of increased importance to patients who have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], due to concerns over poorer health outcomes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an additional opportunity for clinicians to encourage patients to quit smoking and integrate smoking cessation interventions into patient care.

         The behavioral approach to smoking cessation will be discussed in this topic. An overview of smoking cessation and pharmacologic therapies for smoking cessation are discussed separately. (See

         Assessment of willingness to quit smoking for every patient at every clinic visit offers an opportunity to encourage smoking cessation. One way to do this is using a model called the "5 A's"  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74402" href="/z/d/graphic/74402.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         The

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The 5 A’s model is described in detail separately. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Another approach to encourage smoking cessation is to proactively offer treatment during the visit, as clinicians do routinely for other chronic conditions such as hypertension [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. This method is described in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Brief counseling for smoking cessation has demonstrated efficacy. In a study at several primary care practices, one in five people who smoked and who attended a routine primary care appointment was willing to make a serious quit attempt with the help of treatment that incorporated evidence-based counseling and some form of pharmacologic aide [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there are numerous missed opportunities for counseling during office visits, as indicated by National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data that showed that the vast majority of people who smoke did not receive clinician counseling to quit during an office visit [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10

         A combination of behavioral approaches and pharmacotherapy is most helpful to patients trying to quit [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-15
         </a>
         ]. While behavioral approaches can be used to help cope with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, most people will also benefit from the use of pharmacotherapy. (See

         All people who are ready to quit smoking should be encouraged to participate in behavioral counseling programs. Many different behavioral counseling formats are available, including face-to-face modalities (eg, individual patient-clinician encounters and group therapy) as well as other delivery formats, including telephone contact, text messaging, interactive web-based interventions, mobile apps, and website information resources. These other formats can be either standalone tools for patients who are unable to participate in face-to-face counseling or adjuncts to in-person counseling. The different formats generally have in common certain techniques and components of educational content. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Content of therapy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Of most importance is selecting behavioral therapy modalities that will be most engaging and acceptable to the patient, considering patient preference, medical history, beliefs, and availability. Patients may benefit from using more than one modality, such as the combination of group therapy and text messaging. Those who choose not to access therapy can benefit from self-help information resources. Special considerations in selection of effective behavioral therapies for patients with severe mental illness are described separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117204.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to managing increased risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with severe mental illness", section on 'Tobacco smoking'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Formats for behavioral counseling have been evaluated in numerous studies, and many methods of behavioral counseling and support used alone or in combination have been found to be effective. Both individual and group therapy are effective in achieving smoking cessation [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Availability and robustness of studies showing efficacy vary considerably among the different modalities [
         <a href="#rid18">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, many health insurance plans cover tobacco-cessation interventions, including behavioral counseling as well as pharmacotherapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [
         <a href="#rid19">

         For many patients, face-to-face behavioral therapy will consist of only brief clinician counseling in the office. Busy clinicians of any specialty can effectively provide brief advice interventions that increase overall tobacco abstinence rates. This brief counseling should be offered to all people who smoke [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The main components of counseling to include are education about withdrawal symptoms, identification of triggers for smoking and coping skills to address those triggers, and stress management techniques. These are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="local">

         Some patients may engage in formal individual counseling for a period of time to support them through smoking cessation. In-person counseling may consist of multiple visits (often weekly) that start before the quit date. A follow-up visit should be scheduled within a week after the quit date. Visits should continue for one to at least three months after quitting to support a smoker through the quitting process. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of smoking cessation management in adults", section on 'Arrange follow-up'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review found that individual counseling compared with minimal support improved quit rates by 40 to 80 percent, with a small additional benefit associated with having more sessions [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, formal individual counseling is infrequently used, possibly because of the intensity of involvement required and the increasing availability of other resources.

         Group therapy allows patients to learn behavioral techniques while mutually supporting others attempting to quit. Group programs typically include informational presentations about the quitting process, group interactions, exercises on identification of triggers to smoke and coping strategies to address those triggers, a tapering method leading to a "quit day," development of coping skills, and suggestions for relapse prevention (see
         <a class="local">
          'Content of therapy'
         </a>
         below). Only a minority of people are willing to attend such programs, citing the inconvenience, even though group counseling is offered by a number of commercial and voluntary health programs and by some employers and public health resources. The cost can vary from free to several hundred dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies have found that group counseling is effective. One-year quit rates after smoking cessation group counseling programs were approximately 20 percent [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20-22
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review found that group therapy was nearly twice as effective as self-help programs [

         Telephone counseling can be used as the primary behavioral therapy approach or incorporated into a team-based approach to smoking cessation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proactive telephone counseling has been shown to be more effective than reactive telephone counseling. In the proactive approach, a counselor initiates a call on a prearranged schedule; in reactive counseling, an individual initiates the call to a counselor. Most quitlines offer proactive calls several times during the quitting process, and many quitlines offer smoker-initiated reactive counseling also. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of smoking cessation management in adults", section on 'Variations of the 5A's approach'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals can access free proactive telephone counseling throughout the United States at a toll-free number (1-800-QUIT-NOW). Some states in the United States have developed fax-referral programs to link clinician offices to their state telephone quitline. In some states, the quitline distributes free nicotine replacement therapy to eligible quitline callers [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Telephone counseling programs are more effective than simple self-help interventions, in which people are provided with take-home written or audiovisual material to aid them in quitting on their own [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. In a clinical trial, among practices that were randomized to routinely refer people to a telephone quitline, patients had higher smoking cessation rates at 3 and 12 months compared with those who received standard general practitioner care [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Proactive telephone counseling has been shown to have efficacy in several studies, whereas data about reactive counseling are mixed [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,27
         </a>
         ]. One meta-analysis found quit rates were higher for those who received multiple proactive counselling calls after having called the quitline (risk ratio [RR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.28-1.49). Three or more proactive calls increased the chances of quitting, and there was some evidence of a dose response. A randomized trial of a proactive, personalized telephone counseling intervention in adolescents also found improved smoking abstinence at six months, particularly among those who smoked daily (10 versus 6 percent) [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, data on reactive telephone counseling provide only limited evidence as to whether there is any improvement in quit rates among those receiving reactive counseling compared with non-telephone-based controls [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,29

         Mobile phone text messaging consists of personalized smoking cessation support through a series of automated motivational messages. Messages suggest behavioral changes and provide positive feedback while allowing patients to request additional assistance as needed. Automated text messages provide immediate cessation support and assistance when cravings occur [

         Several randomized trials have found that text messaging is effective for short- and long-term abstinence. In a 2019 meta-analysis including 13 randomized or quasi-randomized trials and 14,000 participants, automated text-based interventions increased six-month abstinence compared with minimal smoking cessation support (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19-2.00) [

         ]. Furthermore, the addition of text messaging to another smoking cessation intervention was more effective than the other intervention alone (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33).

         Smoking cessation interventions that are delivered in more than one format increase abstinence rates. Thus, supplementing information discussed during interventions with self-help materials can serve both as a reinforcement and a time-saving resource for the clinician.

         A common feature of the various formats of smoking cessation therapy is that they equip the individual with information about expected challenges during quit attempts and strategies to deal with them. Effective therapies generally begin before the patient's quit date to educate about withdrawal symptoms and effective techniques to use while stopping smoking, as well as techniques to use to maintain abstinence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Techniques from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) offer keys to successful quitting. These techniques include learning to identify and avoid smoking triggers and developing tools to deal with situations that may tempt smoking. Other components of CBT include education about self-monitoring, reducing cigarette intake gradually in preparation for quitting (although some people choose to quit abruptly), and setting a quit date. Effective therapy includes social support delivered as part of treatment to reinforce an individual's confidence in their ability to quit [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,23,49
         </a>
         ]. Ideally, all the elements of CBT for smoking cessation should be incorporated into a treatment plan. (See

          "Overview of smoking cessation management in adults", section on 'Set a quit date'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Components of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may be useful in behavioral smoking cessation interventions [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. ACT teaches acceptance of aversive physical experiences (eg, cravings), thoughts, and emotions. ACT teaches a focus on emphasizing personal values (eg, being healthy and quitting smoking) and acting in alignment with one’s values. Through acceptance and commitment, individuals may be able to be more flexible in their response to smoking urges and then make behavior changes.

         Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, smoking cessation treatment content focused on coping with the stress and boredom associated with self-isolation may be particularly beneficial [

         An important goal of therapy is to help people identify their triggers to smoke. The person anticipating quitting should be encouraged to identify situations, internal states, or activities that may increase the risk of continuing to smoke or of relapsing [

          20

         Stress is a commonly reported barrier to quitting smoking and maintaining abstinence. Clinicians can encourage patients to be aware of stress-related symptoms that they experience as a significant trigger to smoke (eg, muscle tension, irritability, difficulty concentrating, drinking alcohol), and to practice strategies to counter stress and avoid smoking.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stress management strategies that may be helpful include deep breathing, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, brief meditation, or stretching. Mindfulness interventions focused on decoupling associations between cravings and smoking have also been used increasingly in smoking cessation treatment. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         There is limited evidence that mindfulness interventions are efficacious as a standalone treatment for smoking. According to a 2022 Cochrane review, individuals who received mindfulness training were no more likely to quit smoking than individuals who received intensity-matched smoking cessation treatments or no support [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

         We typically encourage a patient to use behavioral therapy weekly or biweekly while preparing to quit and through the quitting process, which may take up to a few months. After quitting, we encourage the patient to have up to three monthly check-ins to maintain smoke-free status. Studies support the benefit of continued counseling for six months. During this period, the patient is likely to be experiencing withdrawal symptoms and adjusting to changes in lifestyle and may be particularly vulnerable to relapse. For a patient using a different method of delivery of behavioral therapy (eg, text messaging, mobile apps, web resources, self-help), although data are limited as to the effects of duration on quit rates, these methods are generally easily accessible for a patient and typically available at no cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meta-analyses of randomized trials found a dose-response relationship between the duration of counseling (both number of sessions and length of each session) and abstinence rates [

However, a randomized controlled trial found that extending CBT to 48 weeks, after receiving 26 weeks of CBT along with initial or extended pharmacotherapy, offered no additional benefit compared with having a briefly monthly call, with 40 percent seven-day smoking abstinence rates for both groups [

          16

         People who successfully quit smoking may also experience a variety of symptoms which can benefit from behavioral therapies, including depression or a sense of lack of support. Continuing to follow patients after they discontinue smoking offers the clinician the opportunity to identify these symptoms and provide counseling and/or medication for depression, as well as advice about support organizations such as the national quitline network (1-800-QUIT-NOW) for support [

         In motivational interviewing, a clinician uses a series of directive and nondirective approaches. Motivational interviewing aims to build intrinsic motivation to change and to resolve ambivalence about change, and to contrast where a patient is with where a patient wants to be (eg, smoke-free). Through trained strategic questioning and listening, a clinician can help patients resolve their ambivalence about behavior change such as quitting smoking.

         A numerical or descriptive scale can elicit current thinking about making a smoking behavior change. A scale can also provide valuable information on how to best direct efforts with the patient. With a 0 to 10 scale, the clinician asks:

         "On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not at all important and 10 being very important, how important is it for you to quit smoking?" The patient's response is used for the next questions, eg, if the patient selects '6,' ask:

         The “
         <strong>
          elicit-provide-elicit
         </strong>
         ” strategy is an effective way to share information about a patient's health and the harms of smoking. With this collaborative approach, a clinician finds out what a patient wants to know and how a patient interprets the information provided by exploring a patient's concerns, knowledge, and questions about smoking. The strategy assumes that patients will value information that they request and perceive it as relevant.

         The clinician can help the patient by listening for or eliciting "change talk," which consists of statements by the patient indicating they are contemplating change. The clinician's goal is to move a patient into commitment talk and commitment to quit smoking.

         The different levels of change talk can be categorized as desire, ability, reasons and need (DARN). When patients express such statements, they may be likely to move toward commitment. (See

          Combination of behavioral support and pharmacotherapy recommended for smoking cessation
         </strong>
         – For smokers who are willing to quit, we recommend management with a combination of behavioral support and pharmacologic therapy (

          Grade 1B
         </a>

          Selection of behavioral intervention
         </strong>
         – Many different behavioral counseling formats are available, including face-to-face modalities (eg, individual patient-clinician encounters and group therapy) as well as other delivery formats, including telephone contact, text messaging, interactive web-based interventions, mobile apps, and website information resources. These other formats can be either standalone tools for patients who are unable to participate in face-to-face counseling or adjuncts to in-person counseling. We encourage the use of behavioral therapy modalities that will be most engaging and acceptable to the patient, and for the patient to use the maximal behavioral intervention available. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Selection of behavioral therapy'

         In most settings, behavioral intervention generally consists of brief clinician counseling in the office, but smokers can also be referred to other resources such as a free telephone quitline for continued counseling support. In the United States, this can be accessed through a national toll-free number (1-800-QUIT-NOW). For patients who have the time and access, formal individual or group counseling are effective options.

          Content of behavioral interventions
         </strong>
         – A key to successful quitting is to equip the smoker with as much information as possible about what to expect during quit attempts, including expectations about nicotine withdrawal. Effective behavioral therapies generally use cognitive-behavioral techniques to provide practical counseling to avoid triggers and deal with situations that may tempt smoking. (See

          Motivational interviewing for patients who are not yet ready to quit
         </strong>
         – For smokers who are not ready to quit, the clinician's role is to assess the patient's perspective of the risks and benefits of continuing to smoke in order to help the smoker to begin to think about quitting. Motivational interviewing techniques explore a smoker's feelings, beliefs, ideas, and values regarding tobacco use. The "5 R's" model (Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblocks, Repetition) is a technique to promote motivation in patients who are unwilling to quit  (
