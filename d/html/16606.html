The management of EoE includes dietary, pharmacologic, and endoscopic interventions. It is uncertain whether treatment of symptoms alone is sufficient or if complete resolution of eosinophilic inflammation is also required.</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical evidence for the role of food allergies in EoE and elimination and elemental diets for the treatment of EoE. The various types of allergy testing used in the diagnostic evaluation of EoE are reviewed separately. Other aspects of disease pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, general diagnostic evaluation, additional treatment options, and prognosis are also discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90146.html" rel="external">"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): Genetics and immunopathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2243.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2247.html" rel="external">"Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/86229.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Eosinophilic esophagitis (The Basics)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7067312"><span class="h1">ROLE OF FOOD ALLERGY IN EoE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Food allergy is defined by a recurrent and predictable immune response upon ingestion of a food antigen. The mechanism of food allergy can vary from immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated hypersensitivity to chronic autoimmune reactions driven by antigen-specific T cells. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2408.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of food allergy", section on 'Types of reactions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of EoE appears to depend largely upon delayed cell-mediated hypersensitivity. Evidence for this is based upon clinical reactions in human subjects, data that show the presence of food reactive pathogenic effector CD4+/G protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15)+/interleukin (IL) 5/IL-13 producing T cells [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], and animal models that rely on the presence of T cells for disease induction [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Disease induction and/or propagation have not been shown to rely on IgE-mediated mechanisms, even though IgE sensitization to foods is common in EoE and the prevalence of food-induced anaphylaxis is higher in children with EoE [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]. In addition, EoE triggered by a specific food can develop after resolution of IgE-mediated allergy to the same food [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>The relationship among gastric acid/gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal eosinophilia, and food allergies still requires clarification. As an example, whether acid can induce epithelial barrier damage that predisposes to food sensitization or whether acid suppression allows for increased IgE sensitization remains to be systematically studied. Data indicate that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) significantly alter gene expression in esophageal epithelial cells by promoting stress response and decreasing mitotic signal genes [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2408.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of food allergy"</a>.)</p><p>Clinical evidence for the role of food in EoE is reviewed below. The immunopathogenesis and murine models of EoE are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90146.html" rel="external">"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): Genetics and immunopathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a>.)</p><p>The evidence for the role of food allergies in the pathogenesis of EoE is based upon the clinical response when patients are placed on various elimination diets, with resolution of symptoms and normalization of esophageal biopsies. The use of elimination diets with serial endoscopies after food reintroduction has helped identify the most common food triggers. In addition, the onset of EoE during clinical oral immunotherapy (OIT) trials for peanut, hen's egg, and cow's milk supports the hypothesis that delayed-type hypersensitivity is the mechanism underlying EoE pathogenesis. For OIT, the rates of EoE onset can be up to 5 percent, but the rate of gastrointestinal symptoms is higher, up to 20 percent. The true rates of OIT-induced EoE may not be discovered due to OIT discontinuation and, at times, PPI therapy, which results in EoE remission [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Implicated foods'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113421.html" rel="external">"Oral immunotherapy for food allergy", section on 'Efficacy and adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H455290"><span class="h1">DIETARY THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The three main modes of treatment for EoE are pharmacologic therapy (ie, topical glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitor [PPI]), dietary therapy, and dilatation of esophageal strictures [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The choice of first-line therapy is patient dependent. Dietary changes, PPIs, or topical glucocorticoids are first-line options for initial treatment of EoE. Dietary avoidance is a common primary approach, particularly in children, and is also a good initial treatment option in motivated adults. It can also be used as a secondary approach if pharmacologic treatments fail. Dietary elimination is associated with resolution of symptoms, esophageal eosinophilia, and, in some cases, esophageal subepithelial fibrosis [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Food elimination coupled with topical glucocorticoids can improve symptoms and histology [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>] and reverse fibrotic complications [<a href="#rid19">19</a>] in children with EoE. Dietary therapy is presented here. The general approach to the treatment of EoE and detailed discussions on the use of topical glucocorticoids, PPIs, and esophageal dilatation are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2247.html" rel="external">"Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)"</a>.)</p><p>The appeal of the dietary approach is that it potentially offers an effective nonpharmacologic treatment, with continued food avoidance functioning as a long-term disease control option. On the other hand, allergen avoidance with elimination and elemental diets poses a risk of nutritional deprivation, can be difficult for patients and their caregivers (particularly if nasogastric feedings are required), can lead to psychological problems, can be expensive [<a href="#rid20">20</a>], and may lead to food aversion in children [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. Relapse upon discontinuation of the diet is common [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and long-term EoE recurrence rates while on the same diet remain to be clearly elucidated. This point is salient since adherence to the diet is difficult and can impact quality of life [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In one survey, adult patients with EoE deemed diet to be the most inconvenient therapeutic option [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. On the other hand, once a "safe" diet is determined, further elimination of foods is usually unnecessary. Starting with a single-food elimination diet (1FED; eg, removing cow's milk) can lessen the potential adverse effects (eg, nutritional deficits, psychosocial impact) of dietary therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2103844529"><span class="h2">Types of dietary therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The three primary choices for initial dietary avoidance of potential food allergen triggers in patients with EoE are an empiric elimination diet, a testing-directed diet, or an elemental diet. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a> and <a class="local">'Choosing an elimination diet'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H708373783"><span class="h3">Empiric elimination diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most commonly used dietary therapy for EoE is the empiric elimination diet. This diet is based upon the concept that the empiric avoidance of those foods that most commonly cause immediate hypersensitivity in a population would also resolve EoE. Cow's milk is the most common trigger in children and is one of the top triggers in adults as well. Thus, cow's milk elimination only has become the most common initial empiric elimination approach. The initial form of this diet empirically eliminated the six foods/food groups (six-food elimination diet [6FED]) that account for the majority of IgE-mediated food reactions (ie, cow's milk, hen's egg, soy, wheat, peanuts/tree nuts, fish/shellfish). However, adherence to dietary therapy that involves elimination of multiple foods is difficult, raising the question of whether less restrictive diets were an option as the initial approach. Subsequent data showed that fish/shellfish and peanuts/tree nuts were rare triggers for EoE, and foods such as grains, legumes, and meats were more common triggers. This led to more prominent use of four-food group elimination (4FED; cow's milk, hen's egg, soy +/- other legumes, and wheat). Further data have shown that the efficacy of cow's milk elimination alone is close to that of 4FED and is easier to follow. The number of eliminated foods can be increased sequentially and may decrease the number of endoscopies required in some patients [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Implicated foods'</a> below and <a class="local">'Efficacy of different dietary approaches'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choosing an elimination diet'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1882360055"><span class="h3">Testing-directed elimination diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This diet is also called the directed elimination diet or testing-based elimination diet. It has become an increasingly uncommon approach due to limited utility, labor intensity, and greater success of empiric elimination diets. Skin prick testing (SPT), which examines immediate hypersensitivity to food antigens, and atopy patch testing (APT), which attempts to elucidate delayed-type, cell-mediated reactions to foods, are performed to test for food allergies, with subsequent elimination of foods with positive test results (plus cow's milk because of its poor negative predictive value on testing). SPT is standardized and validated for immediate food hypersensitivity. However, APT is not standardized or validated for EoE and now is rarely used clinically or in research. This testing-directed approach met with some success in children [<a href="#rid9">9,26</a>] but has had more mixed results in adults [<a href="#rid27">27-29</a>]. Studies in adults and children have shown that directed diets based upon in vitro specific IgE testing in isolation or in addition to skin prick/patch testing can be successful to varying extents, although further study is needed before routine use of serum-based testing is recommended [<a href="#rid17">17,28,30,31</a>]. In vitro T cell proliferation to food antigens such as cow's milk may provide an approach for determining EoE-triggering foods in the future. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a> and <a class="local">'Efficacy of different dietary approaches'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choosing an elimination diet'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4087705377"><span class="h3">Elemental diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient is placed on an amino acid-based (elemental) formula  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377" href="/d/graphic/79377.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63667" href="/d/graphic/63667.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), which eliminates all potential food allergens. This approach is the most effective but is challenging to follow, particularly for adults, and therefore is used rarely. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy of different dietary approaches'</a> below and <a class="local">'Choosing an elimination diet'</a> below.)</p><p>These diets are used both as therapy and as a diagnostic tool to identify specific food triggers. As such, the initial diets are not permanent but rather a starting point. The exact timeframe for foods to induce EoE and for the disease findings to resolve upon food trigger removal is not clear. Data in adult patients show that EoE can recrudesce endoscopically and histologically in as little as 7 to 14 days, while symptoms and esophageal eosinophilia can recur in approximately three days after food reintroduction [<a href="#rid4">4,32</a>]. However, one study showed that more than six weeks of dietary elimination was required for maximal effectiveness [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Thus, the initial diet is typically followed for four to eight weeks. Symptoms are assessed, and a repeat upper endoscopy with esophageal biopsies is performed at the end of the initial avoidance period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3738343518"><span class="h2">Implicated foods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common food triggers are reviewed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129670" href="/d/graphic/129670.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Both empiric and directed methods for antigen elimination show that cow's milk is the most common food trigger for EoE in children, and it is also a common trigger in adults [<a href="#rid9">9,30,34-37</a>]. However, some patients with EoE triggered by cow's milk are able to tolerate more processed forms of dairy, such as baked milk or extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>]. Among 105 adults in Spain, 43 percent respond to cow's milk and wheat/gluten elimination (of these, 52 percent had only milk as a trigger, 16 percent had only wheat/gluten, and, for 28 percent, both milk and wheat/gluten were triggers) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. While peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish are common triggers in food-induced anaphylaxis, they do not commonly trigger EoE in either children or adults [<a href="#rid4">4,9,28,34</a>].</p><p>Empiric diet followed by single-food antigen reintroduction implicates wheat as the second most common trigger in children (26 percent), while directed diets demonstrate hen's egg as the second most common food trigger in children [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In another pediatric study of 78 children with EoE who underwent empiric 4FED and single-food antigen reintroduction, histologic inflammation was triggered by cow's milk in 85 percent, hen's egg in 35 percent, wheat in 33 percent, and soy in 19 percent [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. In adults in the United States, wheat was the most common antigenic trigger identified (60 percent), followed by cow's milk (50 percent), in a study of prospective empiric elimination and single-food reintroduction [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In another United States study that included nine patients who underwent food reintroduction after an empiric or directed elimination diet, cow's milk was identified as a trigger in four, hen's egg in four, wheat in two, shellfish in one, legumes in one, and tree nuts in one [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Cow's milk was the most common (62 percent), followed by wheat (29 percent), hen's egg (26 percent), and legumes (24 percent), in a similar study in Spanish adults [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>Population differences in EoE-triggering foods are probably related to which foods are most frequently ingested. The positive and negative predictive values for the most common EoE food triggers are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis", section on 'Food allergy testing in EoE'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H676935639"><span class="h2">Efficacy of different dietary approaches</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The available data on dietary management of EoE come from a mix of observational studies and a few randomized trials comparing different types of elimination diets. Most of these studies reported on the impact of dietary intervention on histologic findings on esophageal biopsies. It is important to note that symptoms and histologic findings do not always correlate.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Empiric elimination diet</strong> – Based upon observational data, empiric elimination diets appear to be more effective in achieving histologic remission compared with no treatment.

A randomized, multicenter trial involving 129 adults with EoE randomly assigned to 1FED (elimination of animal milk) or 6FED failed to detect a difference in rates of histologic remission between the two groups at six weeks (34 versus 40 percent, respectively; absolute risk difference 6 percent, 95% CI -11 to 23 percent) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Improvements in quality-of-life scores and peak eosinophil counts were also similar in both groups. In a nonrandomized continuation of the study, patients who did not achieve histologic remission on 1FED (n = 44) were asked to choose subsequent treatment with either 6FED or a topical glucocorticoid.

Other important factors that may influence the decision include costs (often not borne by insurance providers), convenience, ease of adherence, and patient/caregiver preferences. When choosing a diet for any given person with EoE, it is important to have a discussion with the patient and their caregiver(s) regarding the advantages and disadvantages of dietary manipulation, as well as the importance of adherence to the chosen food restrictions. Approximately one-third of pediatric patients with EoE who go on an elimination diet are nonadherent, similar to the rates seen with pharmacologic therapy for EoE [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. It is also important to consider the resources of the treating center (eg, APT, nutritional counseling). Alternatives to dietary therapy are also discussed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2388.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2247.html" rel="external">"Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preferred elimination diet and rationale</strong> – The empiric elimination diet is the preferred approach at many centers. For most patients with EoE, we suggest initial elimination of cow's milk in all its forms (eg, cow's milk/dairy in baked goods, butter, yogurt, cheese) and cross-reacting mammalian milk (eg, goat's milk) rather than a multi-food elimination diet. In patients who do not respond to cow’s milk elimination alone, the number of eliminated foods can be sequentially increased (eg, remove cow's milk and wheat, soy, or hen's egg and, if that is not successful, proceed to the 4FED, which removes cow's milk, hen's egg, soy, and wheat) [<a href="#rid14">14,49,50</a>]. Some centers eliminate wheat only, whereas others eliminate all gluten-containing grains. Similarly, some remove only soy, while others remove all legumes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Success rates associated with the cow's milk-only, 2FED (cow's milk and wheat/gluten, soy/legumes, or hen's egg), or 4FED empiric diets are similar to that seen for the testing-based diet, particularly in children (see <a class="local">'Efficacy of different dietary approaches'</a> above). There is a paucity of data on directed diets in adults, but it seems that there is greater success with empiric diets in adults. The empiric diet does not require APT, although SPT to the common food allergens should still be performed because of the risk of unmasking an IgE-mediated allergy after elimination and reintroduction of a food in the diet (see <a class="local">'Reintroduction of foods'</a> below). The empiric approach is particularly useful in the patient who is negative to all foods on testing and in adults who tend to have fewer "positive" tests to foods that are often not clinically relevant. The primary issues with this diet are adherence and potential nutritional deficiencies if multiple foods that are staples in the diet are removed. (See <a class="local">'Empiric elimination diet'</a> above and <a class="local">'Testing-directed elimination diet'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis", section on 'Food allergy testing in EoE'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2388.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elimination of specific foods versus food groups</strong> – The use of the empiric elimination diet has brought up a number of issues regarding avoidance of specific foods versus food groups. Initial studies did wheat elimination only, a practice follow by most US practitioners who were polled (17 of 21). In contrast, international practitioners were more likely to eliminate all gluten-containing grains (wheat, rye, barley) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. These clinical practices may reflect the required allergen labeling that is different in the US and Europe. In addition, while most US clinicians recommend avoidance of only soy, Spanish investigators tend to recommend avoidance of all legumes [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages to alternative elimination diet approaches </strong>– Testing-directed diets are used less commonly due to limited accuracy of available testing in identifying EoE triggers. If used, a testing-directed elimination diet should include the elimination of cow's milk regardless of the testing results because of the poor negative predictive values for cow's milk (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a>). One potential advantage of a testing-based diet is the avoidance of fewer foods if there are a limited number of foods identified by testing. This can lower the cost of the elimination diet and also make the diet easier to follow. In addition, less common food triggers may be identified and removed from the diet with this approach that would have been missed and continued in the diet with the empiric elimination approach. However, these advantages must be weighed against the ability of the clinical practice to do patch testing, a process that is time consuming for both the practice and the patient. In addition, there may be greater issues with adherence in patients who fail this dietary approach if they then attempt an even more restrictive diet and become discouraged or overwhelmed by the effort  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef88643" href="/d/graphic/88643.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Testing-directed elimination diet'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The highest success rates in symptomatic and histologic improvement are seen with the elemental diet. However, even in children, this diet is the most difficult to follow. Thus, we typically reserve the elemental diet for patients who fail other therapies, break through a therapy that initially appeared effective, need a safe source of calories during an elimination diet, or prefer this method as the initial approach. (See <a class="local">'Elemental diet'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5800399"><span class="h2">Instituting an elimination diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Generally, an approach that involves allergy/immunology, gastroenterology, and a dietitian may be the most successful. However, this model may be difficult in the private practice or community health care setting. When available, a dietitian who is familiar with food allergies is a valuable part of the patient's care team when instituting an elimination diet. The role of the dietitian can include help with information on the use of antigen-free foods, particularly ideas for substitutes of favorite foods and ways to ensure a nutritionally adequate diet, recipe suggestions, and review of allergen avoidance. Growth should be monitored, and supplements may be necessary depending upon the foods avoided. A working group report has practical suggestions for implementing and managing an elimination diet in EoE [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2388.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2406.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy: Avoidance"</a>.)</p><p>Patients can start the diet as soon as they are ready. Some advance preparation may be required as far as grocery shopping for specialty items and exploring meal options with the foods available to increase the chances of adherence to the diet. Additionally, some patients without significant symptoms may prefer to wait until after a major holiday to start the diet. Patients also need to be honest about any cheating or accidental exposures while on the diet so that they do not undergo an endoscopy unnecessarily. Depending upon the size of the exposure, the proximity to the scheduled follow-up endoscopy, and the particular food, the endoscopy may be delayed.</p><p>Autoinjectable <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> is often prescribed for patients who are eliminating a food to which they have tested positive (serum IgE or SPT), especially if the food is a nut (peanut or tree nut) or cow's milk and/or the patient has a history of asthma, since there is a risk of an allergic reaction with accidental exposure or reintroduction after a period of avoidance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/388.html" rel="external">"Prescribing epinephrine for anaphylaxis self-treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4145159"><span class="h2">Reintroduction of foods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If symptoms and histology have improved, foods are then reintroduced one at a time. If symptoms and histology have not improved after the initial dietary eliminations, pharmacologic therapy may be started, or a more stringent elimination or elemental diet (if not the initial approach) may be undertaken.</p><p>There are several possible reasons for failure of the initial diet that should be explored before the therapy is adjusted. The initial diet may not have eliminated any of the food triggers for the patient; the initial diet may have eliminated some, but not all, of the food triggers; adherence to the diet may have been poor; allergies to inhalant allergens may be contributing to the disease process in addition to food allergies; or there may be an unidentified trigger. Additional etiologies should be considered in the patient with histologic improvement but persistence of symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy is probably the best option if adherence to the initial dietary elimination approach was an issue or if a patient fails elemental therapy despite good adherence. If a more stringent diet is chosen, foods to consider removing include corn, beef, chicken, pork, potato, and rice [<a href="#rid9">9,26</a>]. Further SPT and/or APT may be performed at this point if not done previously. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2247.html" rel="external">"Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2243.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In patients who have had histologic and symptomatic improvement, our usual approach to food reintroduction is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We typically have patients consume the reintroduced food/food group in normal amounts for 8 to 12 weeks and then repeat the endoscopy if they are asymptomatic or if symptoms are still significantly decreased from baseline. If the patient's endoscopy is normal, we then reintroduce another food and repeat the process. Adult data show that recurrence of esophageal eosinophilia can occur within a relatively rapid timeframe of three to seven days after food reintroduction [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Thus, a shorter timeframe of food reintroduction before endoscopy (eg, two to four weeks) is a reasonable alternative clinical approach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If a patient becomes symptomatic with a food reintroduction, the food is removed from the diet again, and an endoscopy is not performed. We proceed with reintroduction of the next food after symptoms have subsided (approximately two to four weeks). However, if the patient becomes symptomatic with reintroduction of several foods, then we will do an endoscopy to determine if it is normal. In patients with normal endoscopies at this stage, we consider concomitant diagnoses, such as irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If an endoscopy is abnormal after a food reintroduction but the patient is asymptomatic, the course depends upon the severity of the findings. We usually remove the food if there are significant findings, such as esophageal narrowing, linear furrows, fibrosis, and/or eosinophilia throughout the esophagus. In contrast, if the findings are minor, for example, mild eosinophilia in a single biopsy with a normal esophageal appearance, then we will leave the food in the diet and repeat the endoscopy after a few months. However, if it was one of the first foods added back, we would take it back out of the diet, even if histologic findings were minor, and try adding back in other foods first before retrying that food. In addition, other treatments are considered, for example, institution of a PPI for isolated distal eosinophilia.</p><p></p><p>An alternative to following each asymptomatic food reintroduction with an endoscopy is to have the patient reintroduce, one at a time, several of the foods that are lowest on the list of suspected triggers (usually nuts, seafood, and soy for the 6FED, but this depends upon individual patient test results) and then perform the endoscopy. One possible benefit to this second approach is fewer endoscopies if the reintroductions are successful. However, if the endoscopy is abnormal, the patient will have to backtrack on the diet and undergo additional endoscopies to determine which of the foods are triggers. The best order and timing of food reintroduction still requires systematic evaluation.</p><p>Patients can have IgE sensitization to food antigens without clinical reactivity to the foods. Loss of tolerance can occur upon removal of these foods, particularly cow's milk and peanut, to which a person has IgE sensitization [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. As such, subjects who have been counseled to avoid foods based upon IgE sensitization have the potential for IgE-mediated reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) upon food reintroduction. For this reason, the EoE consensus recommendation suggests dispensing an injectable <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> to patients who have significant levels of food-specific IgE if that food will be avoided during the course of EoE treatment [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>We often prescribe autoinjectable <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> for patients who will be avoiding a food for which they demonstrated elevated serum IgE or that results in a large (&gt;8 mm wheal) positive on SPT, especially if the food is a nut (peanut or tree nut) or cow's milk and/or if the patient has a history of asthma. In addition, we suggest that the practicing allergist perform a medically supervised oral food challenge if there is significant food-specific IgE to the antigen that will be reintroduced following dietary elimination, particularly if the patient has asthma [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The rates of loss of tolerance and subsequent IgE-mediated reactions with reintroduction in EoE patients treated with food avoidance have not been systematically evaluated.

In contrast, data in children with EoE suggest that food allergies associated with EoE usually persist [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Since adults can have new-onset EoE, this suggests that either food tolerance is not attained in childhood or is lost during adulthood, that older children/adults with EoE may have a proclivity to accumulate food reactions, or that these patients did not recognize symptoms or were able to adapt behavior changes to cope with their disease until they became highly symptomatic. As such, if reintroduction of a particular food fails, we suggest avoidance of that food for at least two years before attempting reintroduction again.</p><p>Although the mechanisms for the more persistent allergy are not clear, two potential theories that may overlap are immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and T cell response. IgG4 is sometimes found in immune complexes or as free granules in EoE esophageal biopsies and can associate with the severity of EoE histology [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Patients with active EoE to a food were found to have a T cell response in two separate independent studies [<a href="#rid56">56,57</a>]. However, the mounting data, including the failure of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10251" href="/d/drug information/10251.html" rel="external">omalizumab</a> to alter EoE, suggest that IgE has a less prominent and/or ancillary role in EoE, which may explain the differences in the natural disease history [<a href="#rid58">58,59</a>].
