         Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to a state of irreversible kidney damage and/or reduction of kidney function that is associated with progressive loss of kidney function over time.

         The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of CKD in children will be reviewed here. The etiology, epidemiology, natural course, management, and complications of CKD in children are discussed separately. (See

         Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as the presence of structural or functional kidney damage that persists over a minimum period of three months. Functional damage is characterized by sustained reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), persistent elevation of urinary protein excretion, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on this definition, clinical practice guidelines from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2012 included criteria for the diagnosis and staging of pediatric CKD [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The KDIGO diagnosis criteria and staging classification are the standard used in clinical practice, research, and public health in the care of children with CKD and will be used throughout this topic.
        </p>
        <p>
         The KDIGO diagnosis of pediatric CKD is based on fulfilling
         <strong>
          one
         </strong>
         of the following clinical criteria [

         Children under two years of age do not fit within the above classification system, because they normally have a low GFR even when corrected for body surface area. In these patients, estimated GFR based on serum creatinine can be compared with normative age-appropriate values to detect kidney impairment  (

          table 2
         </a>
         ). The KDIGO guidelines suggest that a GFR value &gt;1 standard deviation below the mean should raise concern and prompt more intensive monitoring. (See

         The clinical findings of CKD depend on the underlying disorder (nonglomerular versus glomerular disease) and the severity of kidney impairment. Patients may present with dysmorphic features or physical manifestations representing features of genetic disorders that are associated with kidney anomalies and CKD (eg, hereditary nephritis [Alport syndrome] and cystinosis).

         Nonglomerular causes of CKD affect the tubulointerstitial space and are primarily comprised of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and cystic kidney diseases. Approximately 60 percent of childhood cases of CKD are due to congenital anomalies. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6110.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Generally, CKD in this population will be associated with subtle signs of kidney dysfunction early in its course and are most often identified by imaging including routine antenatal ultrasonography that detects structural abnormalities. Clinical findings include:

         <strong>
          Polyuria
         </strong>
         may be an early presenting finding because many CAKUT (eg, obstructive uropathy, bilateral renal dysplasia), inherited disorders (eg, nephronophthisis), and tubulointerstitial disorders are associated with reduced concentrating ability (ie, arginine vasopressin resistance [previously called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]). In these conditions, the impairment in concentrating capacity of the kidneys generally precedes a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Such patients are at a high risk of acute kidney injury with an acute episode of dehydration as may occur with gastroenteritis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6085.html" rel="external">

         Because the initial presentation of CKD can be nonspecific, a comprehensive physical examination is necessary to determine if the child has findings compatible with CKD. For example, BP measurement is important in a child who presents with gross hematuria as an elevated BP would be indicative of glomerulonephritis, whereas gross hematuria due to urethritis or trauma is less likely to be associated with a high BP value. The physical examination of any child suspected of having CKD should include:

         Ultrasonography (US) of the kidneys is widely available, safe, and noninvasive, making it the initial imaging modality when CKD is suspected. US assesses the dimensions and the structure of the kidneys. It may be diagnostic for some underlying causes of CKD, such as detecting cystic kidney disease or hypoplasia. Antenatal ultrasonography may identify neonates at risk for CKD, especially if there are abnormalities of both kidneys.
        </p>

         The ultrasound examination should compare the measured length of each kidney with normative age-appropriate values  (

         Children with a congenital solitary kidney are at risk for a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Risk factors for a decreased GFR for a solitary kidney include additional anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract and a kidney length not consistent with expected compensatory hypertrophy (defined as a kidney length that is at least 10 percent less than predicted for a solitary kidney) [

         Blood and urine studies are often used to support the diagnosis, assess the severity of CKD, and detect associated complications. Abnormalities in these assessments may not be readily apparent during the early stages of CKD but will become increasingly prevalent as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases. Whereas there is no single pattern of laboratory abnormalities that characterizes pediatric CKD, there are some abnormalities that are commonly present and that are indicative of underlying chronic kidney dysfunction, as discussed in the following sections.

         The serum creatinine is the most commonly used test to estimate the GFR.

         Urinalysis – A urinalysis is a useful screening test for abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract and as an aid in identifying the underlying cause of CKD. The urinary dipstick makes it possible to test for protein, pH, concentration (specific gravity), glucose, red blood cells, and white blood cells. The different patterns of urinary findings associated with both acute and chronic kidney disease are discussed separately. (See

         Proteinuria is an indicator of underlying glomerular and/or tubulointerstitial disease, and is an important biomarker strongly associated with CKD. Persistent high-grade proteinuria (2+ protein or greater by dipstick evaluation) usually warrants a prompt evaluation including detection of orthostatic proteinuria (benign condition) and for signs of kidney dysfunction. Lower levels of protein detected by urinary dipstick can usually be followed with repeated measurements to determine if there is resolution of proteinuria. The presence of persistent proteinuria by dipstick evaluation should be quantified by determination of the first morning urine protein/creatinine ratio. Ongoing urinary protein excretion may contribute to the progression of CKD. The severity of kidney disease is generally associated with the amount and duration of proteinuria. (See

         Kidney biopsy – Kidney biopsy is often done in patients with glomerular causes for CKD. However, kidney biopsy in patients near kidney failure (G5 stage, previously referred to as end-stage kidney disease) may not identify the etiology of CKD, because of the presence of diffuse global sclerosis of the glomeruli and severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Tissue samples obtained via kidney biopsy are typically evaluated by light microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, and electron microscopy. Data from these studies may be useful in providing a diagnosis for the cause of CKD and guiding therapeutic choices. If a specific diagnosis is not possible, it often serves to exclude other disease entities in the differential diagnosis. The biopsy results also provide information about disease severity, including whether any abnormalities may be reversible and the degree of interstitial fibrosis, which is generally not reversible.

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – The clinical presentation of CKD depends on the severity of kidney impairment  (

         <strong>
          Early stage
         </strong>
         – Patients in the early stages of CKD are often asymptomatic unless there are signs and/or symptoms that result directly from underlying structural kidney abnormalities or systemic diseases with kidney involvement.

         Asymptomatic patients may be identified by elevated serum creatinine for age, abnormalities on urinalysis, or detection of kidney disease by imaging studies, particularly prenatal ultrasonography.

          Complications
         </strong>
         – Loss of kidney function is associated with a number of comorbid complications. These include fluid and electrolytes abnormalities, mineral and bone disorders (chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder)  (

          Who should be evaluated
         </strong>
         – Evaluation is considered for all children who have an underlying risk factor for CKD. Additional important aspects of the history include age at onset of symptoms, duration of symptoms, and additional features of CKD (eg, hypertension or poor growth) or risk factors for CKD (eg, family history or congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract [CAKUT]). (See
         <a class="local">

         Physical examination – The examination of the child with suspected CKD should include measurement of growth parameters and blood pressure (BP), assessment for pallor, cardiovascular examination, and examination of the extremities for bony deformities and edema. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Renal imaging
         </strong>
         – Imaging may be useful in identifying the underlying cause of CKD and assessing renal parenchymal structure. Typically, ultrasonography is the preferred initial modality as it is widely available, safe, and noninvasive. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Imaging'

         <strong>
          Laboratory tests
         </strong>
         – Laboratory testing determines the severity of kidney impairment and detects the presence of associated complications. Tests include serum creatinine, electrolytes including serum bicarbonate, complete blood count, urinalysis, and quantification of urinary protein by a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Other tests to consider include serum calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and parathyroid hormone. (See
         <a class="local">

          Referral

         – For children who are diagnosed with CKD, consultation with a pediatric nephrologist is desirable to guide additional testing and evaluation. (See
