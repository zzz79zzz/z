         Prostate cancer has a strong genetic component. While identification of all genetic contributions to accurately predict individual risk remains challenging, a number of advances have changed clinical practice and research directions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supporting the role of genetic factors comes from studies of relatives of patients with prostate cancer (linkage studies), genome-wide association studies, and patients from families with inherited (germline) mutations in known cancer predisposition genes (such as breast cancer susceptibility gene [
         <em>
          BRCA
         </em>
         ] 2 and
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         ). Males with germline mutations in
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         , in particular, are at increased risk of prostate cancer and have more aggressive disease features. In addition, contemporary studies have found a much higher prevalence of known inherited cancer predisposition genes than was previously appreciated in males with more-aggressive-behaving prostate cancer, such as those with early onset, metastatic involvement, and higher Gleason grade. Together, these observations have led to changes in the recommendations for early detection, diagnosis, and management of prostate cancer in the context of certain pathogenic variants in cancer risk genes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Defined, heritable (germline) factors contributing to genetic risk can be divided into two main categories:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Rare deleterious changes, often termed "pathogenic variants" or "mutations," disrupt the function of a known gene. In general, pathogenic variants, such as those in
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         , are uncommon in the population but are associated with a high lifetime risk of cancer (high penetrance).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         More common variants, often single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may be identified within the regulatory or protein-coding regions of a gene or in the intra- or intergenic regions of DNA. These SNPs may directly influence the regulation or function of the gene containing the variant, or the SNP may associate with or regulate a nearby or distant gene that has yet to be directly implicated in the disease. SNPs are relatively common, with allele frequencies of 1 to 5 percent in the population, but they individually confer very modest increases in risk.

         These specific inherited factors and the risk of prostate cancer that they confer are discussed in detail below. (See

         For individuals not yet diagnosed with prostate cancer, a personal and family cancer history (in first- and second-degree relatives), including the type(s) of cancer, age at diagnosis, whether cancer may have contributed to death, and ancestry, may help identify individuals who may carry genetic factors that increase the risk of developing prostate cancer and potentially other cancers. If the family history suggests this possibility, providers should discuss referral to genetic counseling and genetic testing, and shared decision making about genetic testing, as appropriate. For individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer, the personal and family history characteristics described above should be considered, as well as other features, including evidence of metastatic spread and high-risk features in localized cancers, including the presence of intraductal carcinoma  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116321" href="/z/d/graphic/116321.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">
          "Interpretation of prostate biopsy", section on 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Referral to a genetic counseling specialist is important so that patients are educated about basic cancer genetics and inheritance principles, options for genetic testing, and potential outcomes of testing [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, prior to germline genetic testing, minimum pretest education should provide information about the benefits, risks, and limitations of testing, the reproductive and financial implications, and potential further testing of family members (cascade testing). Genetic screening is complex, and the potential benefits should be weighed against the potential negative aspects, including psychosocial consequences, disclosure to family members, and genetic discrimination. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2901.html" rel="external">
          "Genetic testing"
         </a>
         and

          "Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, it is strongly recommended that all patients have access to genetics professionals, although with markedly expanded indications for genetic testing, new care delivery models are being explored [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. One such example is mainstreaming, where most or all patients undergo standard pretest education and genetic counselors are triaged to meet with only a subset of patients who may have a very strong family history of cancer; concerns or unanswered questions; and/or who are identified to have a pathogenic variant, likely pathogenic variant, and/or variant of uncertain significance [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. While there is ongoing debate about optimal care delivery, variable to limited patient access to genetics resources means more research into these models is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) on management of prostate cancer and hereditary cancer testing criteria for genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer recommend that genetic counseling and testing be offered to males with the following [

         Two consensus conferences have addressed emerging areas in genetic counseling and genetic testing for prostate cancer: the St. Gallen Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2017 [

          7

          8
         </a>
         ]. Both consensus statements endorsed adequate pretest and post-test genetic counseling for males with prostate cancer considering genetic testing. The guidelines from the 2019 Philadelphia consensus conference endorses testing of all males with metastatic prostate cancer as well as those with a family history of cancer suggesting a hereditary predisposition, and suggests using gene panels, with priority given to
         <em>

         Loss of DNA mismatch repair (Lynch syndrome) may identify males with advanced disease who might be candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. (See

         Finally,
         <em>

         (and possibly
         <em>

         ) mutations might inform decision making about active surveillance in males with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease [

         Thus, an emerging group of patients is those undergoing somatic/tumor genomic sequencing for treatment decision making (ie, for treatment and/or clinical trial consideration) whose results suggest the potential for inherited cancer predisposition. Ideally, these patients should be counseled,
         <strong>
          prior to
         </strong>
         tumor sequencing, about the potential of uncovering germline findings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Access to genetic counseling specialists is important so that patients may be educated about basic cancer genetics and inheritance principles, options for genetic testing, and potential outcomes of testing. In addition, prior to germline genetic testing, education should provide information about the benefits, risks, and limitations of testing, the reproductive and financial implications, and the potential need for further testing of family members (cascade testing).

         For patients with an inherited predisposition to prostate cancer, we advise consultation at a center of excellence and recommend participation in clinical trials testing screening strategies (when possible). If clinical trial participation is not feasible, our approach, which largely follows National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, is outlined in the table  (

         Patients who develop prostate cancer in the setting of a germline mutation in
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         have earlier onset disease, a higher percentage of clinically significant disease at biopsy, and worse prostate cancer outcomes and survival [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-15
         </a>
         ]; whether the same is true in the setting of germline mutations in
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         or other genes involved in homology-directed DNA repair (conferring "
         <em>
          BRCA

         -ness") is less clear but suspected [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Males diagnosed with Lynch syndrome involving mismatch DNA repair deficiency also appear to be at an increased risk of developing prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         These data provide the rationale for considering males who carry mutations in cancer predisposition genes as a group at particularly high risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer and who, therefore, may benefit from prostate cancer screening.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not all genes involved in DNA repair and not all mutations in a given gene are expected to confer the same level of risk for the development of prostate cancer. To date, the most mature data are available for
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         with respect to lifetime risk for the development of prostate cancer, as well as adverse outcomes associated with a mutation. For other genes, limited information is available, and consequently, pragmatic recommendations for screening and treatment should be considered pending further studies and a stronger evidence base.

         On the other hand, the most recent draft prostate cancer screening guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that males with a family history of prostate cancer talk to their clinician about the potential benefits and harms of screening, with no additional specific guidelines for those with inherited predisposing mutations, such as

         Similarly, year 2013 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines, which were reconfirmed in 2018, state that, for males younger than age 55 years at higher than average risk (including those with a family history of metastatic or lethal adenocarcinomas [eg, prostate, male and female breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers] that spanned multiple generations, affected multiple first-degree relatives, and developed at younger ages), decisions regarding prostate cancer screening should be individualized [

         The importance of genetic factors is illustrated by two large contemporary studies that studied the impact of a positive family history on the risk of developing prostate cancer:

         The magnitude of increased risk was illustrated by a study from the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) that compared the risk of prostate cancer in 51,897 males who were brothers of 32,807 index cases [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The overall risk of developing prostate cancer for males with one brother with the disease by age 65 years was 14.9 percent, compared with 4.8 percent in those without a brother with prostate cancer, and the risk was 30.3 versus 12.9 percent at age 75 years. When the analysis excluded those with low-risk prostate cancer, there was a similar increased risk.

         Additional evidence comes from a prospective study of 203,000 twin pairs (80,000 monozygotic and 123,000 same-sex dizygotic) from Nordic countries; concordance for cancer in monozygotic and dizygotic twins was 38 and 22 percent, respectively, for prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. This study estimated that as much as 57 percent of the risk of prostate cancer could be explained by heritable factors.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to affecting the risk of developing prostate cancer, inherited factors may influence prognosis for males who develop prostate cancer. In a Swedish study of 610 males with prostate cancer whose fathers had had prostate cancer, the survival of the sons correlated with that of their fathers [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. When the fathers survived for five years or more, the hazard ratio for death as a result of prostate cancer (deaths from other causes were censored) in their sons was 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.94) compared with those whose fathers had survived fewer than 24 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the evidence for linking family history of prostate and other cancers to a man's risk of getting prostate cancer is robust, more specific definitions of family history may affect risk estimates. In a population-based study from Utah of 36,360 males with prostate cancer, the use of the following criteria rather than simply a family history of three or more prostate cancer affected relatives increased the risk of prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid6">

         Studies designed to identify predisposition genes in families with numerous individuals affected by prostate cancer have reported several DNA variants that are associated with a prostate cancer diagnosis, including
         <em>
          HOXB13
         </em>
         , ribonuclease L (
         <em>
          RNASEL
         </em>
         ), macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (
         <em>
          MSR1
         </em>
         ), elaC ribonuclease Z 2 (
         <em>

         <em>
          NKX3-1
         </em>
         ), and others.
        </p>
        <p>
         While variants in these individual genes may be strongly associated with a high risk of prostate cancer within specific families, there is substantial heterogeneity across the population and limited reproducibility between studies. Consequently, no single susceptibility locus has been shown to be responsible for a large proportion of familial prostate cancers. The degree of heterogeneity has prevented the use of these variants to ascertain prostate cancer risk in the population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, variants in these genes have not been shown to be associated with aggressive prostate cancers. Thus, males found to carry these variants may be less likely to benefit from early detection and treatment. Currently, a family history of prostate cancer may be similarly or more informative of risk of prostate cancer than the presence or absence of an individual single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or risk variant.

         One example of a gene variant identified in studies of high-risk families is

         Over the past two decades, a large number of population-based assessments have been conducted to identify germline DNA variants that are associated with the development of prostate cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using panels of genome-spanning SNPs have identified more than 100 loci that are associated with a prostate cancer diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-39
         </a>
         ], including multiple loci in the 8q24 region [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-37
         </a>
         ] and the 17q region [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ], as well as in other chromosomes [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37
         </a>
         ]. Collectively, these variants are estimated to explain approximately 33 percent of the familial risk for prostate cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional studies have focused on identifying variants specifically associated with aggressive prostate cancer, including higher Gleason score, cancer recurrence, metastasis, or mortality [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. However, few such loci have been identified; the relative risks for these variants are low, generally with an odds ratio of less than 1.3, and have not conferred a sufficient level of risk to warrant routine testing in the population [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Ongoing studies are evaluating whether combinations of these common but low-penetrance alleles may collectively indicate a risk level useful for guiding screening or treatment recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is illustrated by a study that utilized 2893 Swedish males with prostate cancer and 1781 controls. The risk of prostate cancer was evaluated using a panel of five SNPs from three loci in 8q24 as well as single sites in 17q12 and 17q24.3 [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Although the increased risk was relatively limited if any one of these SNPs was present (risk ratio 1.22 to 1.53), the risk increased dramatically if four of the five SNPs were present (risk ratio 4.47, 95% CI 2.93-6.80). The risk was further increased if four or five of the SNPs were present and the subject had a family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative (risk ratio 9.46, 95% CI 3.62-24.72).
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the association of these genetic variants with the development of prostate cancer, none of the five was significantly associated with prognostic parameters in males with prostate cancer (Gleason score, serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level at diagnosis, age). Although the information from a panel of these markers may be useful in identifying males who are at increased risk for prostate cancer, additional prospective evaluations are necessary to establish the utility of this approach and whether the presence of individual variants or combinations of these variants (polygenic risk) is associated with adverse outcomes such as metastasis and mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although an SNP associated with prostate cancer may not reside within a known gene, it can be used to localize candidate genes that require further confirmation. Among the genes that have been suggested in this way are
         <em>
          HOXB13
         </em>
         , microseminoprotein beta (
         <em>
          MSMB
         </em>
         ), lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (
         <em>
          LMTK2
         </em>
         ), kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (
         <em>
          KLK3
         </em>
         ), copine 3 (
         <em>
          CPNE3
         </em>
         ), interleukin 16 (
         <em>
          IL16
         </em>
         ), cadherin 13 (
         <em>
          CDH13
         </em>
         ), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B (
         <em>
          HNF1B
         </em>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37,42

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Genes identified through GWAS may eventually have a role in prostate cancer screening. Alternatively, given the increasingly appreciated complexity of the noncoding genome, it is also plausible that these SNPs affect the expression of distant genes or the regulation and function of noncoding RNAs in ways that are yet to be fully appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Limitations in genetic screening should also be noted. Differences in the contributions of various SNPs to prostate cancer risk across races and ethnic groups would not be unexpected. The vast majority of family and population-based studies designed to identify genetic risk variants for prostate cancer have been conducted in White populations, with very limited studies in other races or ethnic groups [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43,44
         </a>
         ], although a newer study has examined GWAS in cohorts with wider representation of ancestry [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The deletion of sequences from chromosome 8p is a common event in the somatic genome of prostate tumors [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Results from genetic linkage studies have also provided some evidence that germline 8p alterations may be linked to hereditary prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,48
         </a>
         ]. Whether there is a connection between germline and somatic genetic changes has yet to be established.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combining multiple SNPs with PSA may improve predictive power for detecting prostate cancer. The Stockholm 3 (STHLM3) study was a prospective, population-based screening study for males aged 50 to 69 years that combined plasma biomarkers, genetic polymorphisms, and clinical variables with PSA. In this study, the use of a combination of parameters was more effective than PSA alone in detecting Gleason 7 or higher prostate cancer and in reducing 44 percent of unnecessary biopsies [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional studies are needed in broader populations to determine whether new models and biomarkers can be combined with PSA levels and other clinical factors (ie, age, race, family history, prior biopsies) to identify males who are at particularly high risk for prostate cancer.

         Because germline mutations in DNA repair genes are relatively rare in the general population, current guidelines for germline testing include evaluation of genetic risk based on a family history of cancer and/or a known germline mutation in a relative. (See

         However, studies using panel testing and high-throughput sequencing technologies have identified specific subgroups of males with a personal history of prostate cancer who are more likely to carry inherited mutations in DNA repair genes, including those with metastatic disease and/or who have certain histologic features (ie, intraductal) reported on tumor pathology [

          52

         ]. This cohort was not selected on the basis of either a family history of cancer (including prostate) or age at diagnosis. Mutations were identified in 82 males (11.8 percent). This was significantly more frequent than in a cohort of 499 males with localized prostate cancer (2 percent of males with low- to intermediate-risk cancers and 6 percent of males with high-risk tumors) or in a cohort of 53,105 males without a known cancer diagnosis (2.7 percent). Mutations were identified in 16 of the 20 genes studied. The most commonly involved gene was BRCA2 (37 males, 5.3 percent of those analyzed). Other genes involved included ATM (11 males, 1.6 percent), CHEK2 (10 males, 1.9 percent), BRCA1 (6 males, 0.9 percent), RAD51D (3 males, 0.4 percent), and PALB2 (3 males, 0.4 percent).

         Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate is a distinct histologic entity that represents retrograde spread of invasive acinar adenocarcinoma into prostatic acini and ducts with basal cell preservation. This histologic variant is associated with an aggressive clinical course, including an increased risk of biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and mortality (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">
          "Interpretation of prostate biopsy", section on 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate'
         </a>
         ). Moreover, these histologic features of prostate cancer are also enriched for carrying driver mutations. For example, males with germline
         <em>
          BRCA
         </em>
         mutations are more likely to have intraductal features in their prostate cancer [

         A retrospective study of 799 patients with localized prostate cancer included 313 who died of their disease and 486 with low-risk, localized prostate cancer who did not; germline DNA was sequenced for mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM in all 799 cases [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The combined incidence of mutation in any of these genes was significantly higher in those with lethal prostate cancer compared with localized disease (6.1 versus 1.4 percent). Furthermore, among those with lethal prostate cancer, the incidence of a mutation in

Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by a germline mutation in one of several DNA mismatch repair genes: mutL homolog 1 (
         <em>
          MLH1

         There is increasing interest in and use of somatic (tumor) genomic sequencing approaches to identify prostate cancers with DNA repair alterations for therapeutic decision making and clinical trial consideration. These assays may use tumor biopsies or circulating tumor DNA sampled from blood. Phase III data have been reported for poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in males with
         <em>
          BRCA
         </em>
         -mutated tumors, and this has led to approval of two PARP inhibitors (

         ) for treatment of advanced disease in the setting of germline or somatic mutations in genes that are involved in homologous recombination repair. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128308.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because somatic tumor genomic testing has the potential to identify mutations in inherited cancer predisposition genes, it is important to discuss this possibility with patients and get their consent prior to tumor testing. In a study of targeted DNA sequencing of tumor and matched normal blood (germline) pairs for 451 patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, 27 percent were found to have a somatic mutation and/or a germline pathogenic variant in DNA repair genes, with 19 percent having evidence of germline mutations in genes associated with inherited cancer predisposition [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It should be noted that most commercial tests for tumor genomic sequencing are currently limited to reporting tumor-only results and are not validated for germline cancer predisposition testing, although paired somatic/germline testing is becoming more available [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88
         </a>
         ]. When the identification of a cancer-predisposition-associated mutation occurs from tumor (eg,
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         ,
         <em>

         ), providers should be prompted to refer patients to genetic counseling for discussion of dedicated, confirmatory germline genetic testing. In addition, it is important to recognize that the absence of a germline mutation on somatic-only sequencing is not a sufficient substitute for dedicated germline testing. (See

         Genetic risk assessment should include a detailed personal and family cancer history (in first- and second-degree relatives), including the type of cancer, grade and stage (if available), age at diagnosis, and ancestry. If the family history is suggestive, patients should be referred for genetic counseling and genetic testing, as appropriate  (
