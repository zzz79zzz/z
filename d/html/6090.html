         Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as the abrupt loss of kidney function that results in a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), retention of urea and other nitrogenous waste products, and dysregulation of extracellular volume and electrolytes. The term AKI has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF) as it more clearly defines kidney dysfunction as a continuum rather than a discrete finding of failed kidney function. Pediatric AKI presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric kidney failure, arises from multiple causes, and occurs in a variety of clinical settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prevention, management, and outcomes of AKI in children are presented in this topic review. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AKI in children and the approach to AKI in newborns are presented separately. (See

         Because nephrotoxins are an important risk factor for pediatric AKI, monitoring serum creatinine (ie, measure of kidney function) and drug level (if possible) is important, as it enables appropriate adjustment of drug dosing based on the knowledge of altered pharmacokinetics in early AKI and substitution of equally efficacious but less nephrotoxic drugs [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, clinicians should also monitor drug efficacy and toxicity. However, readjustment of drugs is often challenging as kidney function changes and if drug monitoring is not available, as discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Drug management'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Studies have shown the impact of effective nephrotoxin management with decreasing AKI duration when systematic daily serum creatinine monitoring was put into practice for children who received multiple nephrotoxic medications using an electronic health record [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. A follow-up report showed nephrotoxic medication exposure rate decreased by 38 percent, and the incidence of AKI rate decreased by 64 percent [

         might be protective by causing a diuresis (thereby minimizing intratubular cast formation) and by acting as a free radical scavenger (thereby minimizing cell injury). In the clinical setting, the efficacy of mannitol for prevention of AKI is inconclusive, and its use can result in significant side effects including volume expansion, hyperosmolality, pulmonary edema, and AKI. Its use for prevention of AKI is
         <strong>

          Loop diuretics

         – Loop diuretics such as
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/z/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">
          furosemide
         </a>
         induce a diuresis by reducing active NaCl transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. It has been proposed that the ensuing decrease in energy requirement may be protective of renal tubule cells, which may be faced with a decrease in energy delivery due to renal hypoperfusion or injury. However, the available evidence does not support the routine use of diuretics as a preventive measure for AKI, and in some settings, diuretic use was associated with an increase in serum creatinine. In a retrospective analysis of 914 children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), furosemide was the most commonly administered nephrotoxic agents and its use was associated with a two-fold greater risk of developing AKI after adjusting for other factors [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         ]. As a result, the routine use of loop diuretics to prevent AKI is

In adults, several meta-analyses have demonstrated NAC did not provide any additional benefit to placebo in the prevention of AKI in adults following surgery. Although data regarding the use of oral NAC in prevention of contrast-nephropathy in adults are equivocal, NAC is often administered to high-risk patients undergoing a radiologic study that requires the administration of radiocontrast media, as it is a well-tolerated drug with minimal side effects.

         The fluid status of the child varies depending on the underlying cause, comorbid conditions, and possible previous therapy. Accurate initial assessment is required to determine if the child is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic, and guides initial fluid management. Subsequent fluid therapy is based on careful follow-up with accurate records of fluid input and output, body weights, physical examinations (eg, blood pressure and pulse), and additional invasive monitoring as needed.

If urine output does not increase and kidney function fails to improve with the restoration of intravascular volume (ie, no decrease in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), bladder catheterization is recommended to confirm anuria. At this point, other forms of invasive monitoring, such as measuring central venous pressure, may be required to adequately assess the child's fluid status and help guide further therapy.

However, loop diuretic therapy does not significantly alter the natural course of AKI. The dissociation between increasing the urine output and not affecting the course of AKI with diuretic therapy probably reflects the ability of the diuretic to enhance the urine output in those few nephrons that are still functioning. However, there is no effect on nonfunctioning nephrons, and as a result, there is no effect on the course of the kidney failure. (See

If the diuretic bolus is effective, a continuous infusion of furosemide (0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg per hour) may be started. Furosemide should be promptly discontinued if the bolus doses do not result in a diuretic response within two hours of bolus administration. The risk of ototoxicity and renal toxicity from furosemide use in this setting is significant due to potential elevated serum levels. Care should also be taken to avoid hypotension from overuse of diuretic therapy as this might result in further kidney injury and, in some cases, increase mortality. Loop diuretics should

         An elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis is common in AKI and is secondary to the impaired renal excretion of acid, and the impaired reabsorption and regeneration of bicarbonate. In addition, acid production is frequently increased, especially in critically ill patients due to shock or sepsis. Hyperventilation by the patient resulting in respiratory alkalosis may provide some correction of the acidosis but aggressive mechanical ventilation should be avoided, as hyperventilation results in compromise to cerebral blood flow with the potential for ischemia resulting in worse outcomes. Other measures to treat metabolic acidosis include IV fluid therapy using

         Hypertension is a common complication in children with AKI. Several contributing factors may cause an elevation in blood pressure including fluid overload and renin-mediated hypertension, often seen in children with glomerulonephritis. Initial management is typically administration of a diuretic. Subsequent management is determined by the severity of hypertension, cause of hypertension, and response to initial therapy (such as diuretics). (See

          —
         </span>
         AKI is associated with marked catabolism, and aggressive nutritional support is crucial to enhance the recovery process. Adequate nutrition includes normal maintenance requirements and supplemental calories to address the catabolic needs of the patient. However, the optimal nutritional requirements and nutrient intake composition in AKI remain uncertain, and are based largely on expert opinion [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Nutrient needs of patients with AKI are highly heterogeneous, depending on etiology, catabolic rate, acute and chronic comorbidities, and RRT modalities. No validated guidelines for the nutritional management of the critically ill child with AKI are currently available. It has been suggested that a caloric intake of approximately 30 percent above the maintenance requirements should provide adequate calories in most children with AKI without a substantial risk of overfeeding. Thus, infants should receive at least 120 Kcal/kg per day, and in older children, nutritional intake should be at least 150 percent of maintenance needs. Tight glucose control is recommended, especially since hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in critically ill children and associated with AKI and longer length of PICU stays [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In critically ill children, AKI is associated with abnormal amino acid synthesis and increased protein catabolism. In addition, renal replacement therapy results in amino acid losses, which often leads to negative nitrogen balance when a standard intake of 1.5 g/kg of protein is provided [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, it has been recommended that daily protein intake should be increased to a minimum of 3 g/kg per day in critically ill children with AKI, and additional amino acid supplementation (approximately 20 percent) should be given to children on hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy to compensate for amino acid loss [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. Some experts suggest that protein intake should be targeted to maintain blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at the 40 to 80 mg/dL range as an indication of positive nitrogen balance [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If feasible, the enteral route is preferred over the parenteral route for nutritional support. Enteral feeding promotes gut mucosal integrity, restores immune responses, prevents gut atrophy, reduces the risk of nosocomial infection, and is more cost-effective [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be considered only if enteral feeding cannot be established after five to seven days in the PICU or if the child is severely malnourished. In a multicenter randomized trial involving 1440 critically ill children, patients in whom TPN was withheld for one week versus those who received earlier TPN had lower rates of infection and RRT, and shorter durations of mechanical ventilation, and PICU and hospital stay [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. If adequate protein and calorie nutrition cannot be achieved, because of fluid restriction, RRT should be instituted early in the course of the illness. (See

         Dosing adjustment of renally excreted drugs – Doses of renally excreted medications may require adjustment to avoid toxic accumulation of drugs and their metabolites and to prevent worsening of AKI. When AKI is first identified, the provider should estimate the GFR (

          calculator 1

         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         . The next step is to review the patient's medication list to determine if dosing adjustments are warranted based on the estimated GFR. Dose reductions are generally necessary for renally excreted drugs when GFR falls below 50 mL/min per 1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>

         Accurate determination of kidney function in the acute setting is challenging. Although serum creatinine is the most commonly used measurement for renal clearance, it only accurately reflects stable kidney function.

         Drug monitoring helps to maintain therapeutic levels while preventing drug toxicity. However, for most drugs, monitoring is not available, and in this setting, adequate concentrations for efficacy can only be inferred from clinical response, and there is no ability to determine if these levels are approaching toxicity.

As an example, in a prospective study of 1367 pediatric ICU admissions from three tertiary care centers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in-hospital mortality was six-fold greater among patients with AKI compared with those without AKI after adjustment for age, sex, and underlying diagnosis [

         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33

         In general, the highest mortality rates are seen in infants [

         <a href="#rid37">
          37,39,40
         </a>
         ]. This was best illustrated by a retrospective analysis of hospital coding data from a large United States multicenter dataset of 2,644,263 hospitalized children that reported an overall in-hospital mortality rate among children with AKI of 15.3 percent [
         <a href="#rid32">

         Long-term follow-up is necessary based on the long-term morbidity for children who survive an episode of moderate or severe AKI. Our approach is to follow all children with moderate to severe AKI (stage 2 and above)  (

         ) and those who received kidney replacement therapy at least annually for five years, and continued follow-up until adulthood if any evidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is detected. Widely available interventions for modifiable risk factors (such as hypertension and proteinuria) hold promise for prevention of CKD progression in these high-risk populations. (See
