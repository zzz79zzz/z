Patient selection for and the possible benefits and harms of CTLS and the evaluation of nodules found using chest CT performed for <strong>non</strong>screening purposes (ie, incidental pulmonary lesion) are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7566.html" rel="external">"Screening for lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1917966900"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION AND PREPARATION FOR SCREENING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2215074655"><span class="h2">Guidelines for selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of governmental agencies and medical societies have published guidelines regarding high-risk patients who are eligible for low-dose CTLS  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64078" href="/d/graphic/64078.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). While societies differ slightly in their published recommendations for clinicians who plan on providing CTLS services, we promote the development of an eligibility policy for CTLS based upon any one or a combination of these recommendations. Accordingly, practical guidance from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American Lung Association (ALA) regarding CTLS program initiation and operation has been published [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Notably, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have their own recommendations and criteria necessary for reimbursement [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Further details on society recommendations are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7566.html" rel="external">"Screening for lung cancer", section on 'Recommendations by expert groups'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H733046792"><span class="h2">Shared decision-making</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before undergoing CTLS, documentation (at the annual office visit or at the screening site) affirming that at least one decision aid was used by the clinician and the patient for shared decision-making is necessary [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The provider should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening, potential results and likelihood of follow-up diagnostic testing, the false-positive rate of CTLS, and cumulative radiation exposure. In addition, candidates must be willing to be screened annually, undergo curative therapy if diagnosed, and not have underlying comorbid conditions that significantly limit life expectancy. Electronic health record system alerts may be used to ensure that a shared decision-making discussion is accomplished prior to CTLS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H876361446"><span class="h2">Smoking cessation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Smoking cessation and abstinence counseling is included in the shared decision-making discussion that precedes enrollment [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Smoking cessation counseling can be addressed at multiple points including during appointment scheduling and during the CT examination visit, as well as during follow-up in the results letter and discussion. The smoking history should be documented before CTLS enrollment (eg, pack-years of cigarettes, number of years quit). Such counselling is likely effective since smoking cessation rates are higher among CTLS participants than in the general population [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. An overview of smoking cessation is provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">"Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7566.html" rel="external">"Screening for lung cancer", section on 'Our approach to counseling for screening'</a>.)</p><p>Smoking cessation rates observed among participants of the CTLS program appear to be above those seen in the general population [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. One study reported higher quit rates at three months in those who received counseling via telephone following CTLS compared with those who did not receive counseling (17 versus 4 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The overall annualized smoking cessation observed in another CTLS population was 15 percent, compared with 5 percent in the general population [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Relapse rates may be 15 percent lower in those who undergo CTLS compared with the general population. Success appears to correlate with the duration of participation in the screening program and a positive CT examination result [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601538287"><span class="h2">Patient preparation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be free of infectious/inflammatory symptoms for 12 weeks prior to screening. Patients usually are not required to change clothing. Discussion regarding intravenous access is not needed as contrast is not administered. Metallic objects (eg, necklace, pendant) on the chest may need to be removed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6982.html" rel="external">"Principles of computed tomography of the chest"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6882450"><span class="h1">LOW-DOSE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY LUNG CANCER SCREENING PROTOCOL</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1450737474"><span class="h2">Imaging protocol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hardware and image acquisition parameters must adhere to recommended protocols for chest CTLS [<a href="#rid5">5,11,12</a>]. Chest CT performed for other indications (eg, trauma, pneumonia) will differ and usually <strong>cannot</strong> substitute for a CTLS examination.</p><p>Patients are imaged in the supine position. Patients who cannot tolerate lying supine can be imaged in the prone or decubitus position. Patients are asked to hold their breath at end-inspiration during imaging, which is typically less than five seconds on modern CT scanners.</p><p>The following technical parameters need to be met to be an accredited site for CTLS:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multidetector helical scanner with ≥4 detector rows</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Entire chest imaging</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Image thickness of ≤2.5 mm</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Volume CT dose index ≤3 milligray (for "standard"-sized patients [ie, 5 feet 7 inches and 154 pounds])</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dose modulation, either manual or automatic, according to patient size</p><p></p><p>Several agencies including The American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) also provide guidance for other technical parameters for CTLS (eg, tube rotation time, anatomical coverage, kilovolts, pitch, milliampere-seconds, scan duration, reconstruction image-spacing and algorithm, and display field of view and windowing parameters) [<a href="#rid11">11,13</a>] or provide assistance for screening center designation [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2283525455"><span class="h2">Radiation dose</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radiation exposure from a single CTLS exam is, on average, about 1 millisievert (mSv). To put this into context, annual radiation exposure from natural background sources is, on average, 3.1 mSv in the United States. Worldwide it is 2.4 mSv per year, lower in some parts of the world (eg, Canada at 1.8 mSv per year), and higher in other parts. The average dose from mammography is 0.7 mSv. No ill-health effects from such low doses are likely in adults since radiation effects have not been proven to exist in patients exposed to levels below 100 mSv above background [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Sites accredited for CTLS must demonstrate adherence to radiation dose limits [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. For reimbursement purposes, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have mandated that several predefined CTLS technical parameters for each CT examination be entered into an approved national registry [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In addition, the ACR Lung Cancer Screening Registry reports radiation dose from individual participating institutions compared with regional and national averages [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>In the future, an opportunity to lower CTLS dose below 1 mSv may be available with ≥64 detector row scanners and dose reduction software. However, implementation of lower dose limits awaits more universal propagation of this scanner technology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2687855072"><span class="h1">LUNG IMAGING COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCREENING REPORTING AND DATA SYSTEM (LUNG-RADS)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H284929995"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CTLS reporting is standardized according to the lung CT screening reporting and data system (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acr.org%2FClinical-Resources%2FReporting-and-Data-Systems%2FLung-Rads&amp;token=HhzB8ewTEac1uIkPd%2ByZqp%2FZcvdWrIw54KU4ykno7ZGhX0WubpMFgPKoUd%2BesX5HrJqHEJlRHzDLy5ywoRX015rt%2FyfrMA%2FRlA4KWG1G2MU%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=121013" target="_blank">Lung-RADS</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. When evaluating the CT, the radiologist reports a Lung-RADS score (LR 0 through 4), which accounts for pulmonary nodules and other findings concerning for lung cancer (eg, airway nodules, atypical cystic lesions), as well as potentially inflammatory/infectious lesions, and any significant incidental findings (eg, adrenal nodule). Each LR category is associated with an estimate of lung cancer risk. Based upon this risk, recommendations for further management of the abnormality are made. (See <a class="local">'Lung-RADS (LR) categories: Assigning lung cancer risk'</a> below and <a class="local">'Significant incidental findings (S modifier)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3282743917"><span class="h2">Components of the evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lung-RADS evaluation involves several assessments, which are discussed in this section.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H888141927"><span class="h3">Pulmonary parenchymal nodules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The radiologist assesses features similar to those used to describe incidental pulmonary nodules with notable differences. Nodule consistency, size, and growth are the major factors considered in the LR score. Other nodule factors which could affect the LR score include perifissural and juxtapleural nodule location (may lower the score) and a spiculated border (may raise score). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Nodule features'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nodule consistency</strong> – Based on their CT attenuation, nodules are generally classified as solid, part-solid, or non-solid (ground-glass). The likelihood of underlying lung cancer varies with nodule consistency, the details of which are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Attenuation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Size and lower limit threshold</strong> – Lung-RADS defines nodule size as the mean of the long and short axes. Solid and part-solid nodules can be considered positive on a baseline screening exam if they measure ≥6 mm; non-solid nodules are considered positive if they measure ≥3 cm. Corresponding volumetric nodule thresholds are also incorporated into Lung-RADS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Per Lung-RADS, nodule measurements are obtained in lung windows and are reported to the nearest one decimal point (eg, 5.4 mm). However, in some practices, including ours, nodule size is reported in 1 mm integer ranges (ie, 5 to 6 mm, 12 to 13 mm). This enables the radiologist to convey the limits of the spatial resolution of the CTLS imaging and more clearly report inter-reader variability versus true nodule growth in follow-up.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In Lung-RADS, the lower limit size threshold of solid nodules ≥6 mm was chosen to minimize the false-positive rate of baseline examinations without significantly increasing the false-negative rate:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a mortality benefit from lung cancer screening using a maximum diameter nodule size threshold of ≥4 mm [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, in the NLST, increasing the nodule size threshold to a mean diameter of ≥6 mm (ie, similar to that used in Lung-RADS) decreased the detection rate of positive nodules from 27 to 13 percent without significantly changing the overall false-negative rate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (IELCAP) defined the nodule size as the mean of the long and short axes. Using positive nodule size thresholds of 5 and 6 mm mean diameter, the rate of detecting positive nodules was 16 and 10 percent, respectively, with no observed delay in cancer diagnosis using a 6 mm threshold [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Growth</strong> – Growth is defined as an increase in nodule size &gt;1.5 mm (mean diameter) within a 12-month period. Thus, when the nodule size is increased but does not meet the 1.5 mm growth threshold, the assigned LR score and follow-up interval recommendations for the nodule remain unchanged. For ground-glass or part-solid nodules, development of a new or enlarging solid component, even in the absence of overall nodule growth, can prompt the LR score to be upgraded.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Exceptions include solid, part-solid, or ground-glass nodules demonstrating growth over multiple screening examinations but not meeting the &gt;1.5 mm increase in size for any 12-month interval. A slow-growing non-solid nodule may be classified as Lung-RADS 2 until the nodule meets criteria of another category, such as developing a solid component (then manage per part-solid nodule criteria). A solid or part-solid nodule demonstrating slow growth over multiple screening exams is suspicious and may be classified as Lung-RADS 4B. Another exception is when a nodule crosses a new size threshold for another Lung-RADS category, even if not meeting the definition of growth, the nodule should be reclassified based on size and managed accordingly.(See <a class="local">'Lung-RADS (LR) categories: Assigning lung cancer risk'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The definition of growth for an atypical cystic lung lesion is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Atypical cystic lesions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3176748299"><span class="h3">Airway nodules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Airway nodules identified during screening are also included on Lung-RADS scoring. This includes any rounded, tubular, or soft-tissue nodules in the trachea or endobronchial tree, regardless of benign or malignant features. Segmental and proximal airway lesions and lesions with a soft tissue component are more likely to be malignant while subsegmental and/or multiple tubular endobronchial abnormalities favor a benign etiology. Absence of soft tissue components, low attenuation (&lt;20 Hounsfield units), and presence of air within airway abnormalities are considered benign features suggestive of secretions. As benign airway findings often resolve on follow-up imaging, persistence of airway nodules in proximal or segmental airways should prompt additional evaluation (including PET/CT if there is a large solid component or referral to bronchoscopy).</p><p>Airway nodules are part of Lung-RADS scoring because in one large lung cancer screening study, 22 percent of cancers missed at initial screening were central endobronchial lesions [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p>Growth of an airway nodule is not defined, but persistence of an airway nodule in proximal or segmental airway at three months (even in absence of growth) upgrades the lesion to category 4B and prompts further diagnostic evaluation per Lung-RADS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4046227163"><span class="h3">Atypical cystic lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Occasionally, malignancy is associated with a cystic lesion within the pulmonary parenchyma. Atypical cystic lesions were not initially included but are reported in Lung-RADS 2022 and include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thick-walled (≥2 mm) cyst</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multilocular cyst</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Growing thick-walled or multilocular cyst</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Growing cystic component in a previously stable thick-walled cyst</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multilocular cyst with increased loculation or density</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cyst with adjacent nodules</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cavitary nodules, especially those where the soft tissue component of the cavity wall is greater than the cavitary/cystic component (ie, most of the cyst is composed of the wall and has minimal cavitation)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If a cyst is associated with a nodule, Lung-RADS addresses the most concerning feature.</p><p></p><p>Growth of a cystic lesion is defined as a &gt;1.5 mm increase in cyst size (mean diameter), wall thickness, and/or size of the cystic component (mean diameter) occurring within a 12-month interval.</p><p>Unilocular thin-walled cysts and fluid-containing cysts are not classified by Lung-RADS since they are unlikely to have malignant potential (eg, fluid containing cysts, which often indicate infection). Additionally, multiple cysts indicating an alternative diagnosis are not classified by Lung-RADS (eg, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Birt-Hogg-Dubé, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis). If, however, there is a particular lesion that looks different or more concerning, that lesion could be singled out and evaluated by Lung-RADS. Further details regarding the diagnostic approach to cystic lung lesions are provided in a separate topic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112259.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to the adult with cystic lung disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3028972205"><span class="h3">Potentially infectious or inflammatory lesions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lung lesions that are potentially infectious or inflammatory are also evaluated in Lung-RADS. What comprises a potentially infectious or inflammatory lesion is poorly defined. Nonetheless, we consider lesions with any one of the following in this category:</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pulmonary lesions appearing in a short interval (eg, segmental or lobar consolidation, multiple new nodules [more than six in number], large solid nodules [≥8 mm])</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>New nodules in certain clinical contexts (eg, immunocompromised patient)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tree-in-bud nodules/abnormalities</p><p></p><p>Some of these findings may be indeterminate for infection/inflammation or obscure underlying lung parenchyma constituting an incomplete exam. (See <a class="local">'LR-0 "incomplete"'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2345506169"><span class="h3">Incidental lesion unrelated to lung cancer screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Incidental findings require an 'S' modifier in Lung-RADS, but Lung-RADS does not specify what constitutes an 'S' modifier nor does it dictate the associated management. This designation is largely left to the discretion of the interpreting radiologist. Generally, we define a significant incidental finding as any unexpected finding that is either new or unknown (eg, ascending aortic aneurysm) and requires some form of further clinical or imaging evaluation before the next scheduled CTLS examination. Findings that are already known, treated, or in the process of clinical evaluation do not require an 'S' modifier.
