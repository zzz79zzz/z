         The Bartholin glands (also called the greater vestibular glands) are located in the vulva, and blockage of the Bartholin ducts is a common etiology of a vulvar mass. The most common Bartholin masses are cysts or abscesses. The mainstay of management of a Bartholin mass is incision and drainage (I&amp;D), and a Word catheter is often placed as well (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65445" href="/z/d/graphic/65445.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The Word catheter is a balloon that is placed in the Bartholin gland after I&amp;D to allow continued drainage and re-epithelialization of a tract for future drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the procedure for incision, drainage, and placement of a Word catheter for treatment of a Bartholin cyst or abscess. General principles of the diagnosis and management of a Bartholin cyst or abscess and the management of other types of vulvar abscess are discussed in detail separately. (See

         </span>
         The indication for incision and drainage (I&amp;D) and Word catheter placement is the presence of an uncomplicated Bartholin mass. Placement of a Word catheter into the mass allows the contents to drain and, over time, to form around the catheter a fistulous tract from the dilated duct or abscess to the vestibule to allow future drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
         The stem of the Word catheter is latex, and thus use of this device is contraindicated in patients with
         <strong>
          latex allergy
         </strong>
         . There are few other contraindications to Word catheter placement.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The patient is evaluated prior to the procedure to confirm that a vulvar mass is a Bartholin cyst or abscess, rather than another vulvar mass. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5492.html" rel="external">
          "Bartholin gland masses", section on 'Evaluation'

        </p>
        <p>
         Informed consent is obtained, including a discussion of risks and benefits. This is documented in the medical record.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ensure that the patient does not have any allergies or hypersensitivity reactions to any agents that will be administered (eg, latex, iodine, amide-type anesthetics).
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients ≥40 years old, most experts advise a biopsy of a Bartholin gland mass. Bartholin gland carcinoma is rare, but the risk is increased in this age group. (See

         If a recurrence occurs or as an alternative to Word catheter placement, marsupialization or excision may be performed, usually in an operating room or ambulatory surgical facility. Marsupialization refers to a procedure whereby a large (1.5 to 3 cm) incision is made over the center of the Bartholin mass and then the inside edges of the mass are everted and sewn with interrupted stitches to the vestibular mucosa (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         If the catheter falls out before the tract is epithelialized and the cyst or abscess remains, the patient may need a repeat Word catheter placement or another procedure, such as marsupialization or excision. If the problem has resolved, the patient can be followed for complete resolution and recurrence.

         grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10

         Placement of a Word catheter into the Bartholin cyst or abscess allows the contents to drain and, over time, to form around the catheter a fistulous tract from the dilated duct to the vestibule. (See

         The cyst or abscess is incised with a 5 mm stab incision, 1.5 cm deep, in the introitus at or behind the hymnal ring. Loculations are broken down and a Word catheter is placed in the cavity, its balloon inflated with 2 to 3 mL of

         or water, and the end tucked into vagina. (See

         The catheter is left in place for at least four weeks to promote formation of an epithelialized tract for permanent drainage of glandular secretions, although epithelialization may occur as soon as three weeks. When the tract appears well-epithelialized, the catheter is removed. (See
