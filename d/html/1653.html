Mechanical ventilation and supportive therapies are the mainstays of treatment.</p><p>The ventilator strategies used to treat ARDS are reviewed here. In general, these recommendations are in keeping with those issued by several society guideline groups [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]. Nonmechanical ventilation related aspects of ARDS management and prone ventilation are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1641.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Fluid management, pharmacotherapy, and supportive care in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1630.html" rel="external">"Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1120039629"><span class="h1">SELECTING INVASIVE VERSUS NONINVASIVE VENTILATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most clinicians use invasive mechanical ventilation (ie, ventilation via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy with breaths delivered by a mechanical ventilator) for patients with ARDS, particularly those with moderate or severe ARDS (ie, arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>] ≤200 mmHg on positive end-expiratory pressure ≥5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). Noninvasive ventilation (NIV; ie, ventilation via a mask, nasal prongs, or helmet with breaths delivered by an NIV device) may be reserved for the occasional patient with mild ARDS who is hemodynamically stable, is easily oxygenated, does not need immediate intubation, and has no contraindications to its use. This approach is based upon our experience and conflicting data regarding the benefit of NIV (eg, prevention of intubation, improved mortality) in this population. Importantly, when NIV is implemented, frequent evaluation is necessary and clinicians should have a low threshold for intubation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5114.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support", section on 'Positive pressure noninvasive ventilation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5118.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A small randomized trial reported that compared with high concentration supplemental oxygen via venturi mask, patients with ARDS treated with NIV had improved oxygenation and lower rates of intubation (4.8 versus 36.8 percent) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, interpretation is limited due to factors including small size, selection bias, lack of blinding, and lack of general applicability based upon the multiple exclusion criteria.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In contrast, a study of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, many of whom had ARDS, reported increased mortality in association with NIV when compared with patients treated with high flow nasal cannula [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Details of this trial are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114077.html" rel="external">"Heated and humidified high-flow nasal oxygen in adults: Practical considerations and potential applications", section on 'Medical patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subset analysis of data from the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG-SAFE) reported that use of NIV in patients with severe ARDS (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio &lt;150 mmHg) was an independent predictor for mortality, such that clinicians should be wary of its use in patients with this degree of hypoxemia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The type of mask worn may impact outcome. In a single-center unblinded trial of 83 patients with mild or moderate ARDS, helmet-delivered NIV  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108315" href="/d/graphic/108315.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) reduced the need for intubation (18 versus 62 percent) compared with NIV delivered through a full face mask [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, helmet-delivered NIV was also associated with a higher rate of ventilator-free days, shorter ICU stay, and lower 90-day mortality without an increase in adverse effects. However, this study was also stopped early, which may have exaggerated the effect size. In addition, helmets are not widely available and expertise in helmet use is low.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>NIV failure may be associated with the etiology for ARDS. In one prospective study of 306 patients with ARDS who were treated with NIV, patients who had a pulmonary etiology for ARDS had slower improvement, more NIV failure (55 versus 28 percent), and higher 28-day mortality (47 versus 14 percent) than those who had ARDS due to an extrapulmonary etiology [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p>Most patients with ARDS require intubation and mechanical ventilation. During the peri-intubation period, 95 to 100 percent oxygen should be given to ensure an adequate oxygen saturation. Because oxygen uptake may exceed replenishment in areas with low V/Q ratios, some clinicians use slightly less than 100 percent oxygen (eg, 95 percent) in an attempt to prevent absorptive atelectasis [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Once well established, absorptive atelectasis is not rapidly reversed by a reduction of FiO<sub>2</sub> to maintenance levels, emphasizing the desirability of limiting prolonged periods of high FiO<sub>2</sub> during and following intubation [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/260.html" rel="external">"Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults"</a> and <a class="local">'Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygenation target'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">LOW TIDAL VOLUME VENTILATION: INITIAL SETTINGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with ARDS, we and others recommend low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV; also known as lung protective ventilation; 4 to 8 mL/kg predicted body weight [PBW])  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507" href="/d/graphic/87507.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147" href="/d/graphic/87147.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143448" href="/d/graphic/143448.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). LTVV is typically performed using a volume-limited assist control mode, targets a plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) using a strategy outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). This approach is based upon several meta-analyses and randomized trials that report a mortality benefit from LTVV in patients with ARDS. It is thought that low tidal volumes (V<sub>T</sub>) mitigate alveolar overdistension induced by mechanical ventilation, which can cause additional lung injury and mortality in patients with ARDS. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and harm'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1598.html" rel="external">"Ventilator-induced lung injury", section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>Despite strong evidence to support the benefit, clinicians underutilize LTVV, perhaps due to under-recognition of ARDS. A 2016 multicenter, international prospective cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS reported that ARDS was recognized by clinicians only 60 percent of the time, and less than two-thirds of ARDS patients received a V<sub>T</sub> of ≤8 mL/kg PBW [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Data published in 2021 [<a href="#rid14">14</a>] was no more encouraging, with only 31.4 percent of nearly 2500 patients receiving lung protective ventilation as defined as a plateau pressure less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 and a tidal volume &lt;6.5 mL/kg predicted body weight. In this study, use of early lung protective ventilation was associated with lower standardized mortality ratios. The use of a written protocol outlining how to provide LTVV is associated with enhanced compliance in patients with ARDS [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. We support the development of institutional protocols that promote LTVV to ventilated patients with ARDS  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>In patients with ARDS, we agree that the use of standard variables (V<sub>T</sub> and Pplat, lung compliance) should be used to manage ventilator settings. Driving pressure (DP) is being also being increasingly used, although parameters for its use are poorly defined. (See <a class="local">'Assessment (clinical, gas exchange, plateau and driving pressure)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335120063"><span class="h2">Application and titration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>LTVV typically involves the following initial steps  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Choosing volume- or pressure-limited assist-control mode (see <a class="local">'Volume- versus pressure-limited mode'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Setting the initial V<sub>T</sub> and respiratory rate (see <a class="local">'Tidal volume and respiratory rate'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Setting PEEP and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) (see <a class="local">'Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygenation target'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4228160471"><span class="h3">Volume- versus pressure-limited mode</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While practice varies among clinicians, most experts adhere to a strategy of LTVV, using a volume-limited assist-control mode. However, a pressure-limited mode is an acceptable alternative, as long as the resulting tidal volumes are stable and consistent with the strategy of LTVV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78436" href="/d/graphic/78436.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). In most patients with ARDS, a volume-limited mode will produce a stable tidal volume while a pressure-limited mode will deliver a stable airway pressure, assuming that breath-to-breath lung mechanics and patient effort are stable. Regardless of whether a volume-limited or pressure-limited mode of ventilation is chosen, fully supported modes of mechanical ventilation (eg, assist-control) are generally favored over partially supported modes (eg, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation), particularly for initial settings. Differences between these modes are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1196893886"><span class="h3">Tidal volume and respiratory rate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend adhering to LTVV using a protocol similar to that used in the ARDS Network low tidal volume study trial  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/141067.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a> and <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/141068.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>), a trial that reported a mortality benefit from LTVV [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The initial V<sub>T</sub> is set at 6 mL/kg PBW and the initial respiratory rate is set to meet the patient's minute ventilation requirements, provided it is ≤35 breaths per minute (most often between 14 and 22 breaths/minute). The PBW is calculated using the following equations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507" href="/d/graphic/87507.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147" href="/d/graphic/87147.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For females: PBW (kg) = 45.5 + 0.91 * (height [cm] - 152.4)</p></div></div><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For males: PBW (kg) = 50 + 0.91 * (height [cm] - 152.4)</p></div></div><p></p><p>Follow-up adjustments and targets used to follow patients with ARDS are discussed below.

While an optimal approach to setting applied PEEP and FiO<sub>2</sub> has not been established, we typically set PEEP at 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and FiO<sub>2</sub> at 1 at the onset of initiation of mechanical ventilation; if the patient's oxygenation allows it, the FiO<sub>2</sub> is rapidly weaned over the next hour to target a peripheral saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 88 to 95 percent (typically low to mid-90s). Further adjustments of PEEP and FiO<sub>2</sub> are then made using the strategy outlined in the ARDS Network LTVV study  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. A reasonable oxygenation goal during LTVV is an arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) between 55 and 80 mmHg (7.3 to 10.6 kPa) or an oxyhemoglobin saturation between 88 and 95 percent. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and harm'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies that compare conservative with liberal oxygenation targets in mechanically ventilated patients (as well as other populations) have not yielded clear guidelines on optimal levels of oxygenation in patients with ARDS. One major trial performed exclusively in patients with ARDS found no survival benefit when a conservative oxygen strategy (target PaO<sub>2</sub> 55 to 70 mmHg; SpO<sub>2</sub> 88 to 90 percent) was compared with a liberal oxygen strategy (PaO<sub>2</sub> 90 to 105 mmHg SpO<sub>2</sub> ≥96 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. This trial and others comparing liberal with conservative targets are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Fraction of inspired oxygen'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Efficacy and harm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Collectively, evidence suggests that the early application of and adherence to LTVV improves mortality, as well as other clinically important outcomes in patients with ARDS [<a href="#rid14">14,16,18-21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The multicenter ARDS LTVV trial randomly assigned 861 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to receive LTVV (initial V<sub>T</sub> of 6 mL/kg PBW) or what was considered conventional mechanical ventilation at the time (initial V<sub>T</sub> of 12 mL/kg PBW) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The LTVV group had a lower mortality rate (31 versus 40 percent) and more ventilator-free days (12 versus 10 days).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of six randomized trials (1297 patients) found that LTVV significantly improved 28-day mortality (27.4 versus 37 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.88) and hospital mortality (34.5 versus 43.2 percent; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.92) when compared with conventional mechanical ventilation [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This was supported by a subsequent meta-analysis of four randomized trials (1149 patients) that also found that LTVV reduced hospital mortality (34.2 versus 41 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) when compared with conventional mechanical ventilation [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Another meta-analysis of seven trials reported lower mortality in those treated with LTVV when compared with non-volume-limited strategies (34 versus 40 percent), although the difference was not statistically significant [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. No difference in rates of barotrauma or ventilator-free days was reported. Although another meta-analysis of three trials also showed no mortality benefit from LTVV, there were several confounding factors that may have influenced the outcome [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In two prospective cohort studies of 485 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for ARDS, poor adherence to LTVV was associated with increased mortality [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. In one analysis, when adherence to LTVV fell from 100 to 50 or 0 percent, two-year mortality increased by 4 and 8 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In the second analysis, an <strong>initial</strong> V<sub>T</sub> of 7 mL/kg PBW was associated with a 23 percent increase in ICU mortality when compared with those receiving the standard V<sub>T</sub> of 6 mL/kg PBW (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.44) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Later increases in V<sub>T</sub> by 1 mL/kg PBW also resulted in a 15 percent increase in mortality (adjusted HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02–1.29). Similarly, one meta-analysis of seven studies reported a similar inverse relationship between V<sub>T</sub> and death [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The mortality benefit associated with LTVV in patients with ARDS may depend on lung elastance. In one secondary analysis of 1096 patients from five randomized trials that compared LTVV with high tidal volume ventilation, the probability of a mortality benefit was greatest in patients with high lung elastance (ie, low lung compliance; posterior median interaction OR 0.80 per cm H<sub>2</sub>O/[mL/kg], 90% CI 0.63-1.02) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, it is important to recognize that the original ARDS Network trial [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] targeted a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW but allowed for a tidal volume as high as 8 mL/kg PBW in patients with dyspnea, provided that plateau pressure remained &lt;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (ie, elastance was low enough to allow for this). These results suggest that DP may be a better target than tidal volume as it appears to be more reflective of the potential to induce ventilator-induced lung injury. Measurement of DP is discussed below.

LTVV may require permissive hypercapnic ventilation, a ventilatory strategy that accepts alveolar hypoventilation in order to maintain a low alveolar pressure and minimize the complications of alveolar overdistension (eg, ventilator-associated lung injury). Studies showing benefit to permissive hypercapnia reflect the utilization of LTVV, suggesting the benefit is from the low tidal volume rather than hypercapnia [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The degree of hypercapnia can be minimized by using the highest respiratory rate that does not induce auto-PEEP.

As another example, some experts target DP from the outset, while others use it in patients with moderately severe to severe ARDS who are refractory to initial LTVV; the latter strategy is based upon the rationale that higher levels of PEEP (which decrease DP) may help identify a subgroup of patients who have recruitable lung and potentially benefit from higher levels of PEEP. Given the potential for harm in some patients left for prolonged periods on high PEEP, we suggest that trials that use high PEEP to lower DP be <strong>limited </strong>(eg, two to six hours) to ensure benefit or to abandon the strategy if no benefit is seen. In addition, it is unclear whether a ventilator strategy that lowers V<sub>T</sub> (to decrease the DP) would have the same benefit or harm as raising PEEP (to decrease the DP).

In addition, we typically perform a short trial at bedside that involves simple ventilator changes to optimize LTVV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), switch the mode of ventilation (eg, from volume- to pressure-limited modes), and/or increase the inspiratory to expiratory ratio, if oxygenation is an issue. Options should be tailored for each individual. For example, for patients with air hunger, switching from volume- to pressure-limited mode, or increasing inspiratory flow rates, is appropriate. For patients with subsegmental atelectasis causing deterioration in oxygenation, prolonging inspiratory time, either by lowering flow rates in volume-limited modes or increasing inspiratory time in pressure-limited modes, may help.

Among the interventions, only prone positioning (in moderate and severe ARDS patients) and ECMO (in severe ARDS patients; ie, two non-ventilatory strategies) were associated with a lower 28-day mortality (prone positioning risk ratio [RR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-0.99; ECMO RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.38-0.93). Rates of barotrauma were similar among the listed interventions (7 percent). Similarly, another network meta-analysis of 34 trials reported that low tidal ventilation in the prone position resulted in improved mortality in patients with moderate to severe ARDS compared with LTVV alone (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.92; high quality of evidence) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

While we prefer prone ventilation in ARDS patients with severe hypoxemia, this option is not suitable for every patient due to contraindications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68536" href="/d/graphic/68536.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). When proning is not feasible or has failed, we typically consider early consultation for ECMO evaluation. However, there is considerable variation in practice such that some experts attempt to maximize alveolar recruitment or administer pulmonary vasodilators while considering the possibility of ECMO. Importantly, early application (eg, within seven days) of one or more of these therapies is critical for their success. Most of these treatments should demonstrate effectiveness quickly (eg, minutes to hours) so that if they fail to improve gas exchange promptly, alternate options can be attempted before it is too late.</p><p>While good communication with families is important for all patients with ARDS, conveying the gravity of the patient’s illness to loved ones is particularly critical at this point of care.

Many experts attempt these maneuvers before deciding to ventilate in the prone position. The rationale for their use is based upon the use of pressure to recruit non-gas exchanging regions of the lung involved with ARDS. The recruitment of new gas-exchanging alveolar units improves oxygenation. However, data do not demonstrate a clear mortality benefit and some data also suggest harm. If any of these strategies are performed, we suggest that trials be <strong>limited</strong> (eg, two to six hours or one to two short recruitment maneuvers) and the threshold be low to abandon these therapies if no improvement in oxygenation is identified.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1003393056"><span class="h3">Further titration/increase in PEEP (high PEEP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not recommend the <strong>initial</strong> use of a high PEEP strategy in patients with ARDS. Several meta-analyses demonstrated improved oxygenation but no decrease in mortality or ventilator-free days with the use of a high PEEP approach in patients with ARDS [<a href="#rid21">21,52</a>]. However, no consideration was given to heterogeneity of treatment effect regarding whether patients were recruitable with PEEP.</p><p>In patients with severe hypoxemia despite standard LTVV, some experts use a high PEEP strategy such as that employed in the ALVEOLI  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118834" href="/d/graphic/118834.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) [<a href="#rid53">53</a>] or LOVS trials [<a href="#rid54">54</a>] (ie, trials that demonstrated possible benefit). Network meta-analysis does support a high PEEP approach as potentially benefiting mortality when applied without a lung recruitment maneuver [<a href="#rid55">55</a>] and when used, clinicians should assess whether patients' oxygenation improves (ie, responders with recruitable lung) or fails to improve (ie, nonresponders with lung that is not recruitable) so that a decision can be made as to whether it is appropriate to continue or abandon the high PEEP strategy.</p><p>In the experience of the authors, improvements in oxygenation generally occur relatively quickly (eg, two to four hours), although data describing an optimal duration for a high PEEP trial are lacking, and the decision to use high PEEP is often left to the discretion of the treating physician and availability of additional ventilator options.</p><p>While most clinicians use oxygenation as a guide to adjust PEEP, other tools, typically esophageal pressure measurements to guide the adjustment of PEEP, may be considered at this point, although the impact of esophageal pressure-guided PEEP strategies on clinically meaningful outcomes, such as survival, are unclear. Other options include using the driving pressure to determine who has recruitable lung and therefore may benefit from high PEEP. Further details regarding tools that measure PEEP and value of driving are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1642.html" rel="external">"Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)", section on 'Tools for titrating applied PEEP'</a> and <a class="local">'Low tidal volume ventilation: Initial settings'</a> above.)</p><p>It is thought that use of higher levels of PEEP benefits patients by opening collapsed alveoli, which in turn decreases alveolar over-distention because the volume of each subsequent tidal breath is shared by more open alveoli [<a href="#rid56">56-58</a>]. If the alveoli remain open throughout the respiratory cycle (ie, they do not collapse during exhalation), cyclic atelectasis is also reduced. Alveolar over-distention and cyclic atelectasis are the principal causes of ventilator-associated lung injury. However, despite this theory the data suggest that the clinical relevance of improved oxygenation from the application of high PEEP in patients with ARDS is unclear, particularly when LTVV is concurrently used. The application of high PEEP does not appear to be associated with improved mortality except perhaps in those with severe gas exchange abnormalities. Further study is needed to determine the optimal level of PEEP and the ARDS population in whom a clear mortality benefit from high PEEP might be expected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1598.html" rel="external">"Ventilator-induced lung injury", section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with ARDS, meta-analyses of small randomized trials suggest that, compared with low PEEP, high PEEP improves oxygenation, with unclear effects on mortality [<a href="#rid52">52,55,59</a>]. When considering <strong>all</strong> patients ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for ARDS, evidence suggests that there is no clear mortality benefit associated with the use of high PEEP, particularly in those on LTVV. However, subgroup analyses suggest a possible benefit in those with moderate to <strong>severe</strong> ARDS:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2022 meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials (over 4500 participants), reported that a high PEEP strategy without lung recruitment maneuver (LRM) was associated with a lower risk of death than a lower PEEP strategy (RR 0.77, 95% CrI 0.6-0.96; high certainty) [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].

Some patients have a lot of recruitable lung, while others have little recruitable lung as defined by CT scan [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. For example, it has been suggested that during the early phase, patients with pulmonary causes of ARDS and have greater lung recruitability than patients with extrapulmonary causes or late ARDS [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. It has been suggested that the benefits of high PEEP have been underestimated because its advantages in patients with a lot of recruitable lung were mitigated by its detrimental effects in patients with little recruitable lung [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. This theory was supported by a study that found that high PEEP reduced cyclic atelectasis to a greater extent than it increased alveolar strain among patients with a lot of recruitable lung [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. In contrast, it increased alveolar strain without reducing cyclic atelectasis among patients with little recruitable lung. Future trials comparing higher levels of PEEP with lower levels should be restricted to patients with a significant amount of recruitable lung, since we believe that this population is most likely to benefit from high PEEP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1598.html" rel="external">"Ventilator-induced lung injury"</a>.)</p><p>Increased applied PEEP has the potential to cause pulmonary barotrauma or ventilator-associated lung injury by increasing the Pplat and causing alveolar overdistention. It also has the potential to decrease blood pressure by reducing cardiac output [<a href="#rid64">64,65</a>]. However, these adverse effects have not been universally reported and several meta-analyses have suggested no difference in the rates of barotrauma in patients ventilated with low or high PEEP strategies [<a href="#rid52">52,53,66</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H100931745"><span class="h3">Open lung ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Open lung ventilation (OLV) is a strategy that combines LTVV with a recruitment maneuver and subsequent titration of applied PEEP. In theory, LTVV mitigates alveolar overdistention, while the recruitment maneuver recruits additional atelectatic alveolar units and the applied PEEP maintains alveolar recruitment and minimizes cyclic atelectasis; this combination, in theory, should reduce the risk of inducing further lung injury by the mechanical ventilator itself (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1598.html" rel="external">"Ventilator-induced lung injury"</a>). However, on balance, most trials do not show convincing mortality benefit from OLV, despite improvement in oxygenation; in addition, some studies show possible harm such that we suggest avoiding the routine application of OLV as an <strong>initial</strong> strategy in patients with ARDS and reserve it for patients with severe ARDS who are refractory to standard strategies. Importantly, when OLV is used, patients should be closely observed for an oxygenation response, so that the clinician can decide whether it is appropriate to continue or abandon the OLV trial, which should last for a few hours only (eg, two to six hours).</p><p>Although a universally accepted protocol for OLV has not been established and protocols for recruitment and applied PEEP vary among studies, if the decision is made to apply OLV we suggest the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients should receive LTVV as outlined above  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

Criteria for setting PEEP in this setting is unclear; while applied PEEP may be set at least 2 cm above the PEEP, which produces the best lung compliance, most experts use a published protocol that utilizes the fraction of inspired oxygen to guide PEEP, such as one outlined in this table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118834" href="/d/graphic/118834.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) or that used by other experts [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p></p><p>Clinical trials indicate that while OLV improves oxygenation, mortality rates have been conflicting [<a href="#rid67">67-71</a>]. Many of the trials used different types of recruitment maneuvers and PEEP strategies, which may explain the variability in the responses to OLV noted among trials; alternatively, variability may suggest possible subgroups, some that may respond to OLV and others that do not respond (ie, responders versus non responders). Several earlier trials reported a survival benefit with OLV [<a href="#rid67">67,68</a>]. However, many of these trials were fundamentally flawed due to the high V<sub>T</sub> ventilation strategy used in the control groups, which may have explained the higher than usual rates of mortality in the control groups, thereby casting doubt over the validity of the true benefit of OLV. In contrast, a well-conducted international randomized trial (Alveolar Recruitment for ARDS Trial [ART]) reported possible harm with OLV. In ART, 983 mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS were randomized to a conventional low V<sub>T</sub> strategy (see <a class="local">'Low tidal volume ventilation: Initial settings'</a> above) versus an OLV strategy that included a prolonged recruitment maneuver (two to four minutes) and a decremental titration of PEEP [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. Patients managed with OLV had higher 28-day mortality (55 versus 49 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.42) and a higher six-month mortality (65 versus 60 percent; HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.38). Additionally, the OLV group had an increased risk of barotrauma (6 versus 2 percent) and pneumothorax requiring drainage (3 versus 1 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2209219082"><span class="h3">Recruitment maneuvers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A recruitment maneuver is the application of a high level of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or PEEP, with the goal of recruiting non-gas exchanging parts of the lung involved with ARDS to become involved in gas exchange. Recruitment maneuvers may be performed as an independent maneuver or as part of an open lung approach (when recruitment is followed by higher than usual titrated levels of PEEP). (See <a class="local">'Open lung ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p>Most experts agree that prolonged duration recruitment is not warranted [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, network meta-analysis suggests potential benefit to a short duration recruitment maneuver, such as used in the LOVS trial [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. We suggest the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – We believe that there is insufficient evidence to support the <strong>routine</strong> use of recruitment maneuvers in patients with ARDS. However, recruitment maneuvers may be performed in select patients as an attempt to improve oxygenation in those with moderate to severe hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> &lt;150 mmHg). For example, we sometimes also apply a recruitment maneuver when a patient demonstrates desaturation after disconnection from the ventilator (eg, derecruitment after tubing changes, transport) because even a brief period without PEEP can result in alveolar collapse [<a href="#rid73">73,74</a>]. Other potential indications might include desaturations that occur in the context of suctioning, bronchoscopy, or patient repositioning, all of which can induce derecruitment [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Level and type of pressure</strong> – We typically apply PEEP of 35 to 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, although several studies have applied lower or higher levels.

We avoid recruitment of extended durations (ie, &gt;40 seconds) since one study found that most of the alveolar recruitment occurred during the first 10 seconds of the maneuver [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]; in addition, extended duration recruitment maneuvers as part of an OLV strategy in another study (two to four minutes) may have contributed to increased mortality in the OLV group [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].

Significant alveolar overdistention does not appear to occur during a single recruitment maneuver but may occur with frequent recruitment maneuvers [<a href="#rid76">76-79</a>]. Thus, we prefer to perform one recruitment maneuver, although consideration can be given to repeating it one more time if a response was observed but only temporarily maintained. Although there are no data, most experts perform recruitment early in the course (ie, early exudative stage; first 7 to 10 days) since most studies have only tested recruitment in that setting and biologically, recruitment may not be as effective when ARDS moves into the fibroproliferative phase.

Data suggest that the magnitude of the increase in oxygenation is greatest when the recruitment maneuver is followed by high levels of PEEP (eg, 16 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), compared with when it is followed by lower levels of PEEP (eg, 9 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) [<a href="#rid85">85</a>], but the benefits of high PEEP are also unclear.

LTVV is typically performed using a volume-limited assist control mode, beginning with a V<sub>T</sub> of 6 mL/kg PBW, which targets a plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) according to the strategy outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). This approach is based upon several meta-analyses and randomized trials that have reported improved mortality from LTVV in patients with ARDS. Patients should be followed closely using clinical, gas exchange, and ventilator parameters. (See <a class="local">'Low tidal volume ventilation: Initial settings'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with ARDS who improve, an attempt should be made to wean some of the ventilator settings including reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) and PEEP  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072" href="/d/graphic/57072.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), and switching to a partial-assist or spontaneous mode, if tolerated. The rate of weaning is individualized and may take days or weeks. (See <a class="local">'Patients who are improving'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1650.html" rel="external">"Initial weaning strategy in mechanically ventilated adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1652.html" rel="external">"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Optimizing management</strong> – For patients with who do not improve on initial LTVV settings, the next step is to optimize general management, which may include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Optimizing therapy for the underlying disorder (see <a class="local">'Maximize treatment for underlying disorders'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Conservative fluid management (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1641.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Fluid management, pharmacotherapy, and supportive care in adults", section on 'Conservative fluid management'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Assessing for alternate diagnoses and complications of ARDS or mechanical ventilation that may be causing deterioration (see <a class="local">'Consider complications of ARDS or alternate diagnoses'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1637.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features, diagnosis, and complications in adults", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Treating dyssynchrony (if present) (see <a class="local">'Treat dyssynchrony'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Trialing a different settings or modes of ventilation (eg, pressure- rather than volume-limited) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation"</a> and <a class="local">'LTVV with alternate ventilator settings or modes'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the patient stabilizes or improves (arterial oxygen tension [PaO<sub>2</sub>]/FiO<sub>2</sub> ≥150 mmHg), optimizing and continuing with these therapies is appropriate until the patient is ready for weaning.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1633.html" rel="external">"Assessment of respiratory distress in the mechanically ventilated patient"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Refractory patients</strong> – For patients who continue to have moderate to severe hypoxemia and/or require unacceptably high ventilator settings to achieve adequate gas exchange (ie, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> &lt;150 mmHg or Pplat &gt;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) despite optimizing LTVV settings, management is individualized and depends upon the severity of ARDS, underlying comorbidities or complications, reversibility of the underlying etiology, other factors determining prognosis, local resources and expertise, and safety of transfer to another center  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143448" href="/d/graphic/143448.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Practice varies from center to center. Options include prone ventilation, high PEEP, open lung ventilation, recruitment maneuvers, pharmacologic agents including neuromuscular blockers, pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Importantly, early application (eg, within seven days) of one or more of these therapies is critical for their success and trials should be short so that alternate options can be reasonably attempted before it is too late if the therapies do not work. Our general approach is as follows (see <a class="local">'Refractory patients'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For most patients with refractory ARDS (as defined above) despite LTVV, we recommend prone ventilation rather than ongoing LTVV alone (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>) and we suggest prone ventilation rather than other ventilation strategies (eg, high PEEP) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Contraindications to prone ventilation are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68536" href="/d/graphic/68536.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). (See <a class="local">'Prone ventilation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1630.html" rel="external">"Prone ventilation for adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If proning is contraindicated or unsuccessful, we obtain early consultation for ECMO evaluation. In our centers, we reserve ECMO for patients with severe ARDS refractory to other management strategies (including LTVV and proning). Early application of ECMO (ie, within seven days of onset) is critical for its success. Thus, trials of other therapies should be brief so that if the patient does not improve, ECMO can be attempted before it is too late. For centers that do not have ECMO, early transfer is critical. (See <a class="local">'Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134266.html" rel="external">"Extracorporeal life support in adults: Management of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>While awaiting ECMO evaluation, we suggest a trial of high PEEP with or without short recruitment maneuvers. The patient's oxygenation should be assessed several hours after initiating high PEEP (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>) to determine the response (ie, whether the lungs are recruitable). If the patient fails to improve, the high PEEP trial should be stopped. (See <a class="local">'Ventilator strategies to maximize alveolar recruitment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medications that are sometimes used in the management of patients with refractory ARDS include neuromuscular blockers, pulmonary vasodilators, and glucocorticoids (the latter is unlikely to have an immediate effect). These medications are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a class="local">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1641.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Fluid management, pharmacotherapy, and supportive care in adults", section on 'Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1641.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Fluid management, pharmacotherapy, and supportive care in adults", section on 'Sedation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1590.html" rel="external">"Neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients: Use, agent selection, administration, and adverse effects", section on 'Clinical use'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> using high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) for management of patients with ARDS (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). While in the past, HFOV was a popular rescue mode of ventilation for patients with severe ARDS, it has now fallen out of favor since available data suggest no benefit and possible harm associated with its use.
