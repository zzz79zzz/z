         Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH, genetic hemochromatosis) is an inherited disorder most commonly caused by biallelic C282Y point mutations in the
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         gene, or, less commonly, other genes related to iron regulation. These disorders result in increased intestinal iron absorption that can eventually cause iron overload and serious tissue damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic describes our approach to the management of HH and its prognosis with and without treatment.
        </p>

         Related aspects of care are discussed in detail separately.

         In some institutions, combined liver and heart MRI are done as a single imaging test. It is important to discuss with the local radiologist to optimize the imaging options.
        </p>
        <p>
         In selected individuals, biopsy may be done instead of MRI. Examples include individuals who undergo liver biopsy to evaluate for other causes of liver disease or endomyocardial biopsy to evaluate for other causes of heart failure. Biopsies are invasive and the associated risks and benefits should be discussed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7157.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         In individuals with significant concern for iron overload, a trial of therapeutic phlebotomy can be used as a means to both reduce body iron load and determine the degree of iron overload. Phlebotomy-mobilized iron, derived from the number of phlebotomies required to deplete iron stores, can serve as a surrogate measure of body iron overload and thereby guide future management [

         variant, C282Y. Many will have had testing for the H63D variant. Most clinical laboratories test for these two variants; some do more extensive testing.

         We perform testing for C282Y and H63D
         <em>
          HFE

         mutations if not done previously, since there are implications for testing and management of first-degree relatives. (See

         If initial
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         testing is negative, more extensive testing (for
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         variants that were not tested previously or for pathogenic variants in other iron regulatory genes) is appropriate for individuals with significant iron overload that is otherwise unexplained (not due to thalassemia or transfusional iron overload).
        </p>
        <p>
         The sequence of testing (gene panel versus individual gene testing) depends on available resources and whether a specific variant has already been identified in the family. Other HH-associated genes are discussed separately. (See

         The need for rapid and aggressive intervention is greatest in individuals who have developed organ injury from excess tissue iron deposition. These individuals should initiate a program of regular phlebotomy without delay. The schedule and procedure are described below. (See

         Organ injury (or significant iron deposition likely to cause injury) is inferred from one or more of the following findings:

         Many individuals with HH who have organ injury from iron overload also have contributing comorbidities that may exacerbate symptoms and the risks of complications (eg, excess alcohol, viral hepatitis). Addressing these is an important component of management. In some cases, organ dysfunction may be due exclusively (or preferentially) to a comorbidity such as excess alcohol rather than to iron overload. This was illustrated in a case report of a premenopausal woman who was homozygous for
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         C282Y and had a ferritin level of 1000 ng/mL (2247 pmol/L); she was initially treated with phlebotomy for several years until it was determined that her ferritin elevation was likely due to excess alcohol use rather than HH [

        </p>
        <p>
         However, there may be cases in which organ iron deposition has not yet occurred (cases in which the liver MRI or liver biopsy do not show increased iron but the ferritin is increased). The decision to intervene is more challenging in such individuals because it is possible that the increased ferritin is due to another condition such as alcoholic liver disease and that clinically significant iron overload will not occur.

        <p>
         Studies have suggested that individuals with a positive family history of iron overload are likely to have a greater risk of developing organ injury than individuals with a negative family history who are found to have a high ferritin incidentally (eg, when tested as part of a population screening program, which we do not recommend for the general population) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-12

          Phlebotomy
         </strong>
         – If the risk of progression to organ injury is suspected to be increased due to a persistent ferritin elevation above normal, patients are generally treated with phlebotomy, although some may reasonably choose close monitoring of the ferritin level to determine whether it is increasing. Controlled phlebotomy in this circumstance allows determination of phlebotomy-mobilized iron. In general, we tend to recommend a trial of phlebotomy in younger patients without significant comorbidity, since there is little risk, and determination of phlebotomy-mobilized iron can be useful to determine need for maintenance phlebotomy. Expert groups vary in their opinion regarding a specific ferritin threshold at which phlebotomy is clearly indicated, as discussed below. (See

         The TSAT may be elevated in this group, but a normal serum ferritin generally indicates no increase in body iron stores.

         Iron overload is extremely rare in individuals who are heterozygous for
         <em>

         </em>
         C282Y or H63D. However, a finding of a moderately increased ferritin level in heterozygous individuals (above normal but &lt;1000 ng/mL) is relatively common. There is often concomitant alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Management in these individuals is not well established, and we individualize our approach depending on their clinical status and presence of comorbidities that could contribute to (or be caused by) abnormal iron studies. If we are unsure of the degree of iron overload, we often obtain an MRI study of the liver or ultrasound-based hepatic elastography to determine the presence of iron deposition and/or fibrosis. Alternatively, liver biopsy can be performed. (See

         For individuals with evidence of serious iron overload (eg, TSAT &gt;45 percent; ferritin &gt;1000 ng/mL; evidence of tissue iron overload on MRI or other imaging or liver biopsy), we question whether they are in fact heterozygotes rather than compound heterozygotes for a common plus a rare

         variants or test non-

         This approach is consistent with several practice guidelines, although expert groups vary in their opinion regarding a specific ferritin threshold at which phlebotomy is clearly indicated [

         In contrast, phlebotomy is not used in individuals who are asymptomatic with normal serum ferritin levels and no tissue iron on MRI, regardless of their
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         genotype. A lack of iron on MRI (or other testing such as liver biopsy, if performed) indicates that tissue iron has not accumulated. A large proportion of individuals who have an
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         variant (including C282Y) will never develop iron overload, and there is no reason to subject these individuals to phlebotomy unnecessarily.
        </p>
        <p>
         Possible contraindications to phlebotomy are relatively limited and include anemia or hemodynamic compromise that would make the shift in blood volume difficult to tolerate, or limited life expectancy due to other diseases. However, phlebotomy should not be withheld based upon advanced age alone or in patients who are asymptomatic but have iron studies (or other evidence) consistent with iron overload.
        </p>
        <p>
         For individuals who cannot tolerate phlebotomy, other options may include a more limited phlebotomy schedule or volume, erythrocytapheresis, or iron chelation. (See

For those who had adequate iron removal by phlebotomy, a requirement for fewer than 80 phlebotomy procedures was associated with a better survival rate than requiring &gt;80 phlebotomies, suggesting an association of greater iron burden with worse survival despite treatment.

         Patients should be encouraged to maintain hydration and avoid vigorous exercise within 24 hours of phlebotomy. Symptoms of hypovolemia are more likely in patients who have a hemoglobin concentration &lt;12 g/dL (hematocrit &lt;36 percent) prior to phlebotomy. Patients may become mildly anemic during intensive phlebotomy. Storage iron will be mobilized to generate new red blood cells (RBCs). Reticulocytosis may be used as evidence of ongoing erythropoiesis and can be monitored periodically (eg, monthly), especially if the hemoglobin level starts to decline.

         More frequent phlebotomies are appropriate for those with more severe iron overload, if tolerated. Patients with signs of organ injury should deplete excess tissue iron as rapidly as possible without causing undue burdens and symptoms. Twice-weekly phlebotomies may be possible as long as the hemoglobin level remains in a safe range (eg, &gt;11 g/dL) and the patient tolerates the procedure hemodynamically.

         In one study, patients who could not be depleted of excess iron over a period of 18 months had a worse prognosis than those who could be depleted in &lt;18 months, but this may have been a surrogate for greater degree of organ injury rather than evidence that the pace of phlebotomy affects outcomes [

         Less frequent procedures or temporary interruption of the schedule can be used for individuals who have less severe iron overload, those who develop anemia, and/or those for whom the procedure is less well tolerated. Some experts also temporarily interrupt the schedule if the hemoglobin or hematocrit falls by more than 20 percent from prior values.

         Patients should not be unduly worried about missing or postponing a phlebotomy appointment, if necessary, especially if their tissue iron has been mostly depleted, and some patients may reasonably extend the phlebotomies to once every two weeks. It is important to maintain a regular schedule and educate the patient about the need to fully deplete the excess iron, followed by maintenance phlebotomies as needed. (See

          Duration/number
         </strong>
         – The total number of phlebotomies needed to remove the excess tissue iron depends on the degree of accumulated iron. Each 500 mL unit of blood donated contains 200 to 250 mg of iron. Thus, for an individual with 10 grams of excess iron, 40 to 50 phlebotomies (approximately one per week for one year) would be expected to fully deplete the excess iron. This is significantly less than the 70 to 100 phlebotomies that were often required to remove the enormous iron stores in patients who presented with severe symptoms in the era before
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         testing. In a series of 40 newly diagnosed patients who were seen between 1990 and 1995, removal of approximately 30 units of blood (equivalent to approximately 7.5 g of iron) was required to normalize body iron stores (defined as a serum ferritin concentration &lt;50 ng/mL and TSAT &lt;50 percent) [
         <a href="#rid36">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Despite the correlation with the number of phlebotomies, the initial serum ferritin level or hepatic iron content is not entirely accurate in predicting the phlebotomy requirement [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Thus, while an estimate can be calculated to help inform the patient of what to expect, in practice the number and frequency is adjusted over time. The hemoglobin and ferritin values generally become available after the phlebotomy procedure has started and are used to determine the following week's procedure.

          Target ferritin and other laboratory parameters
         </strong>
         – Phlebotomy should continue until iron stores have been reduced, typically assessed by the serum ferritin level. There may be some variation among experts on when this point has been reached (ie, whether it is necessary to induce iron deficiency or merely to deplete excess iron stores).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The 2011 guideline from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, a 2022 guideline from the European Association for the Study of the Liver, and many experts use a target ferritin level in the low normal range [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,13,38
         </a>
         ]. This is variously defined as approximately 50 ng/mL (112 pmol/L); or between 50 and 150 ng/mL (112 and 137 pmol/L).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Any of these approaches is reasonable, provided the patient has ongoing monitoring and maintenance phlebotomy to keep the ferritin near the target level. There is some evidence that iron absorption increases as the ferritin level enters the iron-deficient range with exacerbation of hepcidin deficiency, and thus it is not necessary or advisable to completely eliminate all iron stores [

         Iron generally reaccumulates over time due to ongoing absorption from food. Maintenance phlebotomy (periodic phlebotomy performed after the target ferritin level has been reached) is used to prevent reaccumulation in most individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
         We typically check the CBC and ferritin level at approximately six months after completion of phlebotomy. If the ferritin level has increased and the increase is interpreted to be due to iron reaccumulation (provided there is not another explanation such as an intercurrent illness), we perform maintenance phlebotomies. Typically, removal of one unit of blood approximately three to six times per year is required (approximately once every two to four months). We target a ferritin level in the low normal range (between 50 and 150 ng/mL). More frequent phlebotomies may be needed for certain individuals who have greater iron absorption; less frequent procedures may be reasonable for those with less accumulation or for whom the procedure is especially burdensome.
        </p>
        <p>
         If significant iron reaccumulation occurs (eg, if the individual is not adherent with maintenance phlebotomies and/or the ferritin is &gt;500 ng/mL), we perform more intensive phlebotomies as done for initial treatment. (See

         In older individuals, it is prudent to take note of a decrease in the requirement for maintenance phlebotomies, as this could indicate another source of iron loss that requires investigation such as gastrointestinal or urinary blood loss. All individuals should adhere to general population guidelines for colon cancer screening (or more intensive screening, if indicated, for those with higher than average baseline risk) [

         In some centers, blood removed during therapeutic phlebotomy is donated into the general donor pool, provided pretransfusion testing does not identify another reason for exclusion.

         Liver chemistry abnormalities are common in the general population, especially mild to moderate elevation of the hepatic transaminases [

         ]. In individuals with HH, elevated transaminases may be due to excess iron, but it is important to eliminate the possibility of other contributing factors, especially alcohol, drug-induced hepatic injury, viral hepatitis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This evaluation is discussed separately. (See

         Alcohol can be hepatotoxic with intake as low as 30 grams or more per day (equivalent to approximately two standard mixed drinks, 24 ounces of beer, or 10 ounces of wine). Alcohol content of these and other drinks is summarized in the figure  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). However, many individuals with this level of intake will not develop serious liver disease. More alcohol confers greater risk, but the correlation with liver disease is not linear. Further, alcohol inhibits hepcidin and thus can exacerbate iron overload in individuals with HH [

Following iron removal, it may be possible to consume alcohol on a limited basis (not more than one to two drinks per day). (See

         Patients are often concerned about the effect of specific foods but a balanced, healthy diet (without specific restrictions) is generally appropriate. The following summarizes our approach to dietary advice:

         <strong>
          Meat
         </strong>
         – We do not advise dietary restriction of red meat or organ meats, especially in individuals undergoing regular phlebotomy. This is because the amount of dietary iron absorbed in people with HH (0.5 to 1 mg of iron per day) is far exceeded by the removal of iron by each phlebotomy (200 to 250 mg per unit of blood). However, some individuals may absorb substantially greater amounts of iron. Dietary iron restriction has not been evaluated in randomized trials [

         <strong>
          Supplements
         </strong>
         – It is important to inform patients with HH about the need to avoid vitamins or supplements that contain extra iron. Multivitamins with iron can contain up to approximately 18 mg of iron per tablet, which is much greater than the amount of iron in a healthy diet. People who choose to take a vitamin supplement should read the ingredients and only select products that do not contain additional iron.

         <strong>
          Other dietary changes
         </strong>
         – We generally do not provide specific recommendations about avoiding foods that increase dietary iron absorption or consuming foods that reduce iron absorption. None of these dietary modifications have been studied systematically, and their effect would be expected to be small. If patients ask, we provide information on the general effects on bioavailability but emphasize that dietary changes are not necessary and that a healthy diet is more important than avoiding or increasing specific foods.

         Iron absorption is decreased with intake of tannates (eg, in tea), phytates, oxalates, calcium, and phosphates. Coffee also reduces absorption [

          3,7

         ]. These individuals should be informed about the inheritance pattern of the disorder (autosomal recessive with incomplete penetrance), which means that approximately one-fourth of siblings of an affected individual will be homozygous or compound heterozygous for
         <em>

         variants, assuming both parents are heterozygotes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is generally appropriate to delay testing until adulthood, when informed consent can be given. Iron overload rarely becomes clinically significant until late adulthood. (See

         One exception is individuals with a family history of juvenile hemochromatosis (eg, due to a pathogenic variant affecting hemojuvelin [

         ], hepcidin [

         <em>
          TFR2
         </em>
         ]). Testing for these variants should be performed earlier in adulthood for those with an adult presentation and in childhood for those with a presentation in childhood. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For family members who test positive for a variant associated with iron overload, iron studies are obtained. In some cases it is reasonable to obtain the genetic testing and the iron studies in the same visit (eg, if there is concern about the burdens and costs of returning for a second blood draw). The importance of avoiding other causes of liver injury such as excess alcohol may be stressed; additional aspects of management depend on the genotype and the presence of iron overload. (See

         The scope of findings in first-degree relatives was illustrated in a study involving 214 C282Y/C282Y homozygous relatives of 291 C282Y/C282Y individuals with iron overload [

         People with HH can have a successful pregnancy and generally are not treated as high risk unless they have organ injury from iron overload, which is extremely rare in this age group. Pregnancy depletes as much as 1000 mg of total body iron (equivalent to approximately four phlebotomies), which is generally more than is absorbed from food over the course of the pregnancy. (See

         Often it is advisable to comanage with the hematologist and the obstetrician, agreeing on a desired hemoglobin level and ferritin level over the course of the pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         We monitor the complete blood count (CBC) and ferritin level periodically, with the interval dependent on iron status [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         If the ferritin level is low, we ensure that iron deficiency is not present, as this may adversely affect the developing fetus. Iron deficiency can be judiciously treated with iron to prevent iron deficiency in the neonate. (See

         Untreated, HH can lead to early death. Common causes of mortality in the pre-phlebotomy era included heart failure, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,34,64,65

        </p>
        <p>
         In the era of active treatment, prognosis depends on the extent of organ injury at the time treatment is initiated and the extent of iron removal. Survival appears to be normal in those with a serum ferritin &lt;2000 ng/mL at the time of diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. With phlebotomy, many outcomes are improved including survival, liver disease, cardiomyopathy, and endocrine dysfunction; others such as hepatic cirrhosis and arthropathy often persist despite iron removal. (See

         A population-based cohort study analyzed data collected from 1990 through 2007 on 3832 patients with HH and their 14,496 first-degree relatives, as well as 38,969 population controls and their 143,349 first-degree relatives [

Those identified by other means (eg, screening of family members, routine outpatient testing) had a lower mortality than that of those identified in the hospital but a marginally higher mortality than unaffected controls (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.33).

The overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was similar to the general population; however, those with serum ferritin ≥2000 ng/mL had increased liver-related deaths (SMR 23.9, 95% CI 13.9-38.2), mostly due to HCC (SMR 49.1, 95% CI 24.5-87.9). Those with serum ferritin &lt;1000 ng/mL had a lower mortality than the general population (SMR 0.27, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of death included age at diagnosis ≥56 years, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and liver fibrosis stage F3 or F4. (See

          Urgent (organ injury)

         – The need for rapid and aggressive intervention is greatest in individuals with organ injury from excess tissue iron or ferritin level &gt;1000 ng/mL (&gt;2247 pmol/L). For these individuals, we recommend phlebotomy (

          Grade 1B

          Less urgent (increased ferritin)
         </strong>
         – We also suggest phlebotomy for individuals with isolated substantial increases in serum ferritin (eg, &gt;300 ng/mL in males or &gt;200 ng/mL in females), especially if they have a positive family history of iron overload (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">

         Phlebotomy allows determination of mobilizable iron, which can be a useful measure of iron overload and risk of organ damage. However, some of these individuals, especially those with a negative family history of HH, may reasonably choose expectant management with close monitoring and initiation of phlebotomy if iron stores continue to increase.

          Phlebotomy
         </strong>
         – Phlebotomy is the main intervention to remove excess iron. The procedure is essentially the same as donating blood; some individuals (lower weight, older, anemic) may have smaller volumes removed. The typical schedule is once weekly until the target ferritin level is reached, with modifications as needed for anemia and tolerance of the procedure. The number of phlebotomies can be estimated, but in practice, this is determined by the hemoglobin and ferritin levels, which are monitored periodically. Experts differ on the exact target ferritin, but most agree it should be between 50 and 100 ng/ml, and iron-deficiency should be avoided. Once the target is met, patients are monitored, with maintenance phlebotomies or expectant management guided by the ferritin. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Procedure, schedule, and target ferritin level'
