Affected patients are more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections but have a normal resistance to viral infections. Most are diagnosed in infancy due to the severity of the infection or the unusual presentation of the organism, but some escape diagnosis until adulthood. The prompt recognition of the specific defect may allow the correct management, including the prevention and aggressive treatment of serious infections, the management of complications, and the early evaluation for hematopoietic cell transplantation, which may be curative for many of the phagocytic cell defects.</p><p>This topic provides a brief overview of the types of defects and typical presentation of primary phagocytic disorders, which is the fifth International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) category of inborn errors of immunity (IEI)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139974" href="/d/graphic/139974.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117758.html" rel="external">"Inborn errors of immunity (primary immunodeficiencies): Classification", section on 'V. Congenital defects of phagocyte number, function, or both'</a>). The major disorders resulting from defects of phagocytic function are also briefly discussed. (Detailed discussions of these disorders are presented separately. See hyperlinks in respective sections below.)</p><p>Other IEI can have phagocytic abnormalities in addition to other immune defects, such as Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2), Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), and warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome. These disorders fall under different categories in the IUIS classification. The full classification of IEI is discussed in greater detail separately.

Response to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) may also be abnormal, particularly in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). The most common sites of infection are the respiratory tract, lymph nodes, and skin. Tissue and organ abscesses also occur. Other frequent manifestations include delayed separation of the umbilical cord, abnormal wound healing, dermatitis/eczema, and stomatitis. Many patients have growth failure. Most primary phagocyte disorders are diagnosed in infancy due to the severity of the infection or the unusual presentation of the organism, but some escape diagnosis until adulthood.

Extrinsic factors may also lead to neutropenia by suppression of granulocyte production or cause a decrease in the number of circulating neutrophils via leukocyte autoantibodies or isoantibodies directed against neutrophil antigens. Defects of phagocytic movement may occur secondary to diabetes mellitus, metabolic storage disease, malnutrition, immaturity, and burns. Acquired autoimmune and isoimmune neutropenias result from antibodies directed against neutrophils. Alloimmune (also called isoimmune) neutropenia in infants is caused by transplacental passage of maternal antineutrophil antibodies. Increased neutrophil destruction is also common in chronic splenomegaly from any cause and certain autoimmune diseases (eg, Felty syndrome, lupus erythematosus).

Intrinsic disorders of chemotaxis include glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3 (G6PC3) deficiency, leukocyte-adhesion defects, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (Rac2) deficiency, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), and syndromes with periodontitis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3683069486"><span class="h2">IUIS classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) classification divides the category of primary disorders of phagocytes into four subcategories: congenital neutropenias, defects of motility, defects of respiratory burst, and other nonlymphoid defects  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139974" href="/d/graphic/139974.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

It is caused by pathogenic variants of the fermitin family (drosophila) homolog 3 (<em>FERMT3</em>) gene, leading to impaired activation of beta-integrins [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3918.html" rel="external">"Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3918.html" rel="external">"Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency", section on 'LAD III'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with cystic fibrosis, a pathogenic variant in the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<em>CFTR</em>) can lead to adhesion deficiency in monocytes but not in lymphocytes or neutrophils. This is categorized as LAD type IV. Although integrins are expressed normally, they are not activated. This defect may play an important role in the severe inflammatory process in the lungs in these patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3918.html" rel="external">"Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency", section on 'LAD IV'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6368.html" rel="external">"Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H628521534"><span class="h3">Periodontitis syndromes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several syndromes of severe periodontitis with chemotactic defects due to deficiency of beta 2-integrins have been described, including localized juvenile periodontitis, rapidly progressive periodontitis, acute-necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, and Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (early-onset periodontitis with palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Each syndrome has a characteristic oral location, bacterial flora, and hereditary pattern. Oral antibiotics and intensive dental hygiene may aid some patients, but most experience loss of all teeth at an early age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6281.html" rel="external">"Periodontal disease in children: Associated systemic conditions"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3026575687"><span class="h3">Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency (SGD) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by delay in the separation of the umbilical cord; increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections, especially of the skin, lungs, ears, and lymph nodes; and skeletal and dental abnormalities [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Two defective genes have been identified. Defects in the cytosine-cytosine-adenine-adenine-thymine (CCAAT)/enhancer-binding protein epsilon (<em>CEBPE</em>) gene cause SGD type 1, and pathogenic variants in SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily D, member 2 (<em>SMARCD2</em>) genes cause SGD type 2. The diagnosis is made by examining neutrophils in a peripheral blood smear for the pathognomonic laboratory findings of paucity or absence of specific granules and predominantly bilobed nuclei (pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly). This syndrome is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3933.html" rel="external">"Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1711692694"><span class="h3">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder with severe congenital neutropenia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Most patients have a pathogenic variant in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (<em>SBDS</em>) gene. Patients with SDS have pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption, dyschondroplasia, eczema, and recurrent infection due to both decreased neutrophil chemotaxis and neutropenia. This syndrome is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5914.html" rel="external">"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3483866396"><span class="h2">Defects of respiratory burst</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with reduced neutrophil oxidative burst, as measured by a dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) assay, suffer from recurrent infections. The most common disorder in this category is chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Chronic granulomatous disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CGD is a genetically heterogeneous condition, with both X-linked and autosomal recessive forms. It is characterized by recurrent, life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and granulomata formation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Inflammatory manifestations, especially colitis, are also common. CGD is caused by defects in phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (phox). These genetic defects impair respiratory burst and consequently result in the inability of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) to destroy microbial organisms once phagocytosed. The diagnosis is made by neutrophil function testing and mutation analysis. The cornerstones of CGD management are early diagnosis of infections, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory prophylaxis, and aggressive management of infectious complications. Survival of patients with CGD has dramatically improved, with many now living well into middle age. CGD is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3925.html" rel="external">"Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3923.html" rel="external">"Chronic granulomatous disease: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and monocytes [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It catalyzes the production of microbicidal hypohalous acid in the presence of halide ions and hydrogen peroxide. The overwhelming majority of patients with MPO deficiency are clinically normal, even though this enzyme drives an important cytotoxic system capable of killing bacteria, fungi, parasites, and tumor cells. This disorder is discussed in detail separately. Complete MPO deficiency can cause a false-positive DHR test and therefore should be excluded in patients with possible CGD [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

Genetic variants in the GM-CSF receptor impair signaling by intact GM-CSF, resulting in decreased production and clearance of surfactant. Decreased activity is often the initial symptom in infants and younger children. Weight loss or failure to gain weight is common. A mild, nonproductive cough may be present. Hypoxemia is typically noted. The primary presenting symptom in older children and adults is shortness of breath, usually with exercise.
