         Immersion foot typically refers to an injury caused by cold exposure to tissue not resulting in freezing. This condition is also referred to as trench foot or nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI). NFCI can lead to gangrene or infection acutely, and cold intolerance and pain syndromes chronically.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although less common, prolonged immersion in warm water can also cause injuries to feet and other tissues. These injuries can be painful and acutely debilitating but typically resolve with basic care and do not have lasting sequelae.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will discuss the presentation, diagnosis, and management of immersion foot syndromes, specifically NFCI and warm water-related injuries. Hypothermia, frostbite, and other cold-induced injuries are reviewed separately. (See

         NFCI is a general term that includes
         <strong>
          trench foot
         </strong>
         and its nautical equivalent
         <strong>
          immersion foot
         </strong>
         . NFCI involves injury to the soft tissues, nerves, and vasculature of distal extremities from prolonged exposure to wet, cold (but nonfreezing; generally 0 to 15°C or 32 to 59°F) conditions. Most often feet are involved, but the condition can affect any dependent body part or the hands. In this topic, we will refer to all such conditions as nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI). Frostbite is distinguished from NFCI because it involves exposure to freezing temperatures, as implied by the name. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/179.html" rel="external">
          "Frostbite: Emergency care and prevention"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Feet and hands that sustain NFCI are initially white and numb  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101027" href="/z/d/graphic/101027.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), but later become red, edematous, and extremely painful. In severe cases, the extremity can develop hemorrhagic bullae and tissue necrosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonfreezing cold injury'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The term trench foot was first used during World War I [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], although the condition had been recognized over 100 years earlier during Napoleon's disastrous winter campaign in Russia in 1812 [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Immersion foot, an identical injury, was first described during World War II in shipwrecked sailors aboard life boats [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. When sailors are forced to kneel or sit on the floorboards of a wet boat or the bottom of a lifeboat, the knees or buttocks can be affected. The main civilian groups afflicted with NFCI are shipwrecked crews in cold waters and survivors of wilderness accidents such as plane crashes and capsized boats who must walk in a cold, wet environment with wet shoes and clothing. Hikers and homeless people are also at risk for NFCI.
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of other conditions either related or identical to NFCI have been described. One likely identical condition is "sea boot foot" or "bridge foot"
         <sup>
         </sup>
         [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. This condition was described during World War II in sailors who remained relatively immobile for over four hours at a time while wearing rubber sea boots continuously [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The injury has been described in the hand of a diver who was exposed to cold (6°C) water [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One related but distinct condition is shelter foot (or shelter limb) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. This condition was described during World War II in people who spent nights sitting in cold air-raid shelters without moving or elevating their legs [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The severity was worse if the area in or near the popliteal fossa was resting against the cross bar of a deck chair, suggesting that these injuries were peripheral neuropathies.

         </strong>
         <strong>
          (WWIF)
         </strong>
         is a transient syndrome first described in soldiers in Vietnam. It manifests as painful, white, wrinkled soles of the feet due to immersion in warm water (15 to 32°C; 59 to 90°F) for up to 72 hours [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. It has also been called paddy-field foot and, incorrectly and confusingly, "tropical immersion foot," which is a more severe condition [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Most patients with WWIF recover completely in one to three days with drying and elevation of the feet [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Warm water immersion hand has also been described [
         <a href="#rid11">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As with similar conditions such as frostbite and NFCI, WWIF and measures for its prevention may be forgotten until it recurs. A retrospective survey of a battalion of 400 United States infantry soldiers who trained in rainy mountains in Hawaii in 1994 reported 149 cases of WWIF among the 176 soldiers who returned the questionnaire [

         Individuals are at risk for nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) if the extremities are cold and wet for prolonged periods of time, usually two to three days or longer [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13

         <a href="#rid5">
          5

          Thermoregulatory function of skin
         </strong>
         — The most important physiologic function of skin is thermoregulation. Skin blood flow is under both central and local control. In cold conditions, vasoconstriction can decrease skin blood flow to approximately 10 percent of baseline values. Because the metabolic demands of skin are low, decreased blood flow alone does not cause ischemia. Skin blood flow can also be decreased during periods of immobility when limbs are below the level of the heart.

          Cold-induced vasodilation
         </strong>
         — Maximal vasoconstriction occurs when a hand or foot is cooled to approximately 15°C (59°F). Further cooling causes increases in blood flow known as cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) or the "hunting response." CIVD occurs in 5- to 10-minute cycles. Prolonged and repeated cold exposures increase the amplitude and frequency of CIVD. Inuits, Sami people, and Nordic fisherman have large CIVD response with rapid cycling [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. A strong CIVD response is thought to decrease susceptibility to NFCI, but scientific evidence is lacking. A study of 206 Dutch Marines has been characterized as showing that a weak CIVD response correlates with increased susceptibility to NFCI [

         Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) is characterized by impaired control of circulation and direct damage to the microcirculation, but the mechanism is poorly understood. In animal studies, vascular damage includes microvascular thrombosis with endothelial damage. Reperfusion injury likely plays a role. Animal studies suggest that there can be reversible or permanent damage to nerves from cold, as well as damage to the microvascular blood supply of the nerves. The mechanism of direct neural damage is supported by clinical case reports of reversible peripheral nerve damage in people with severe hypothermia [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although many authors attribute NFCI solely to prolonged vasoconstriction [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ], the cause is likely more complex [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Animal experiments suggest that tissue damage is inversely proportional to tissue temperature and directly proportional to duration of exposure but that repeated exposure is likely to cause more damage than a single, longer exposure [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. The duration of a single exposure at a given temperature that is necessary to cause NFCI is not known, nor are there quantitative estimates of the effects of repeated exposure. Cold alone, without moisture, does not seem to be sufficient to cause NFCI. Immobility and malnutrition appear to contribute to injury in many cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tissue loss is generally not a feature of NFCI. Tissue loss in severe cases of NFCI is likely caused by pressure injury with or without compartment syndrome when boots become tight after the feet swell, rather than cold. Mechanical damage to the tissue also seems to contribute to tissue loss, such as in circumstances in which victims of NFCI must walk for long distances with wet, swollen feet.

         Research into the pathophysiology of warm water immersion injuries is limited. Warm water immersion foot (WWIF) is thought to be caused by hyperhydration (waterlogging) of the plantar stratum corneum when continuously exposed to warm water for up to 72 hours [

         </span>
         Risk of nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) exists with exposure to wet cold at temperatures from 0°C (and also slightly below freezing) to approximately 15°C (59°F) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. During World War II, prolonged exposure of shipwrecked sailors to sea water at estimated temperatures of 16 to 21°C (61 to 70°F) for eight days resulted in injuries similar, if not identical, to immersion foot [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There is great variability among individuals in susceptibility to cold injury. Nevertheless, some common risk factors have been identified. Situational factors that contribute to NFCI include immobility, inadequate or wet clothing, constricting boots and clothing, inadequate fluid or caloric intake, and fatigue and stress, especially in combat. Associated injuries or underlying circulatory problems, including peripheral vascular disease or Raynaud phenomenon, may contribute to the risk or severity of NFCI. Diabetes causes circulatory problems that may predispose to NFCI. Smoking, older age, and ethnicity may play a role, but data are lacking. Mental illness and alcohol use are also likely risk factors.
        </p>
        <p>
         A study of 100 soldiers referred to a military clinic in the United Kingdom with suspected NFCI reported that 76 were diagnosed with the condition while 24 received alternate diagnoses, most commonly neurapraxia and Raynaud's phenomenon [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The authors concluded that NFCI occurs most often during winter training in younger, less-experienced personnel. Risk factors included African-Caribbean ethnicity (higher risk than White individuals), "feeling generally cold," performing static duties, wearing wet boots and clothing, and immersion of the affected limb in water.

         <strong>
          First stage: During cold exposure
         </strong>
         — The key finding in the first stage is loss of sensation. This usually takes the form of complete anesthesia. Patients complain of "numbness," sometimes describing feet or hands as feeling like a block of wood. Due to this loss of sensation and proprioception, patients may become clumsy and may have difficulty walking. Extremities may be bright red at first but then become pale or completely white due to extreme vasoconstriction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101027" href="/z/d/graphic/101027.html" rel="external">

          Second stage: Following cold exposure
         </strong>
         — The second stage begins as soon as the patient is removed from the cold environment and continues during and after rewarming. This stage usually lasts just a few hours but may persist for as long as several days. The extremities become a mottled pale blue, reflecting a slight increase in blood flow. The color change can be hard to see in darkly pigmented skin. Peripheral pulses are initially thready. Subsequently, pulses become bounding, but capillary refill is delayed. The extremity continues to be cold and numb. Some swelling can occur. The patient may still have problems walking.

          Third stage: Hyperemia
         </strong>
         — The third stage typically begins abruptly and lasts for days to weeks, in severe cases, for 6 to 10 weeks. The affected extremity becomes bright red and edematous with bounding pulses but with delayed capillary refill, reflecting microcirculatory damage. Anesthesia is replaced by intense pain with hyperalgesia. However, the distal areas of the affected extremities may remain anesthetic. Tissue damage is usually not apparent, but highly damaged areas may develop blistering. Nonviable areas of tissue are rare but may become blistered or discolored before developing necrosis in the fourth stage.

          Fourth stage: Following hyperemia
         </strong>
         — The fourth and final stage may end after a few weeks, persist for years, or be permanent. The affected extremity usually appears normal, unless there has been tissue necrosis, which is uncommon. Affected extremities are cool and are often very sensitive to cold. Vasoconstriction in response to cold is common. Extremities may remain cool for hours after a brief exposure to cold. The majority of patients have chronic pain, usually in response to cold. Small areas may continue to be anesthetic. Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) is common. Some patients develop symptoms similar to complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), if not actually CRPS.

         Abrasions from wet socks and ulcerations over pressure points, where footwear puts pressure on swollen tissue of the feet or ankles, are common. Typically, these lesions develop over areas of swollen tissue rather than over bony prominences.
        </p>
        <p>
         Plantar surfaces are hyperhydrated and wrinkled. In Vietnam in the mid-1960s, patients with severe cases had fever and inguinal lymphadenopathy. These findings were not present in the original descriptions from World War II in the South Pacific. Recovery begins with resolution of fever and adenopathy, decreased pain and tenderness, and normalization of the plantar surfaces within two to three days. The redness of the dorsal surfaces and ankles resolves, changing to diffuse blotchy ecchymosis, tiny vesicles, and a fine maculopapular rash. Edema resolves in four to seven days. Following desquamation, the skin becomes normal without vasomotor changes.

         Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) may (rarely) coexist with frostbite, complicating the diagnosis. If there was no exposure to temperatures several degrees below freezing, frostbite can be ruled out. Diagnosis of NFCI depends on a history of prolonged exposure to cold (generally slightly below 0 to 15°C), wet conditions, and clinical findings consistent with the four stages of injury described above. The primary alternative diagnosis is frostbite. Frostbite that has been thawed may become hyperemic and swollen within hours, but a sharp demarcation between distal affected and proximal unaffected tissue distinguishes frostbite from NFCI. (See

          TIF
         </strong>
         occurs from longer exposure and manifests initially as burning pain, pain with walking, and symmetrically swollen, red, tender feet and ankles, typically with a clear line of demarcation at the level of the boot tops. Pain is increased by weight-bearing. The skin is initially cool but becomes warm within 12 hours. Wet-sock abrasion and small ulcerations over pressure points, where the footwear puts pressure on swollen tissue of the feet or ankles, are common. In severe cases, fever (38 to 39°C) and inguinal lymphadenopathy without lymphangitis may be present [

         Although frostbite can be confused with nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI), a history of exposure to temperatures well below freezing favors frostbite, especially if there has been direct exposure of digits to subfreezing cold air. Nevertheless, frostbite and NFCI can conceivably coexist, making diagnosis difficult. Like NFCI, frostbite can initially have a pale appearance. However, unlike tissue with NFCI, frostbitten tissue that is still frozen appears waxy and feels firm.
        </p>
        <p>
         After thawing, frostbitten hands or feet can become hyperemic and swollen. Unlike NFCI, frostbitten tissue becomes cyanotic after thawing with a demarcation between affected and unaffected tissue of the digits, hands, or feet. Formation of blisters in the first 24 hours can occur in frostbite but is rare in NFCI. Blisters that occur in the initial course of NFCI are caused by pressure-induced injury. (See

         Pressure-induced soft tissue injury and acute compartment syndrome (ACS) result from elevated tissue pressures that compromise blood flow leading to severe pain and, in ACS, local and possibly distal ischemia. If there is exposure to wet, cold conditions, these conditions may coexist with and complicate NFCI. Tissue necrosis occurring in dry conditions is more commonly caused by pressure-induced injury, ACS, or a combination of the two, even in the setting of cold exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         A history of immobility without cold exposure or the presence of typical pressure sores over bony prominences suggests isolated pressure-induced injury. Pressure-related ulcerations associated with immersion foot develop when footwear restricts further swelling and places pressure on soft tissues that are already swollen. Lesions generally occur on soft tissues rather than bony prominences.
        </p>
        <p>
         ACS most often develops following significant trauma (eg, long bone fracture) but may occur from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Important findings with ACS include progressive pain out of proportion to the injury accompanied by tense, swollen compartments. ACS is a surgical emergency diagnosed by measuring elevated compartment pressures and treated with fasciotomy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Imaging is helpful in identifying fractures but not in distinguishing pressure-induced injury from NFCI. Whether or not there is exposure to cold conditions, soft tissue infection can complicate pressure injury or ACS.

         In wet, cold conditions, soft tissue infection can complicate NFCI. In dry, cold conditions, soft tissue infection can be mistaken for NFCI. Distinguishing soft tissue infection from NFCI may be difficult. The presence of fever or other systemic symptoms such as nausea suggests infection, but low-grade fever can occur during the first few days of NFCI alone [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         ]. Lesions from NFCI are often symmetric, unlike infections. Imaging studies may reveal an abscess. However, imaging cannot distinguish inflammation due to infection without abscess from inflammation due to NFCI. A bedside ultrasound examination may be useful if a secondary loculation suggests an abscess.

         Lesions from warm water immersion injury may resemble those from nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) or frostbite.

         Pressure-induced soft tissue injury can lead to blistering or ulceration, both of which may be rare sequelae of warm water immersion injury, although small ulcerations can develop over pressure points—sites where footwear constricts soft tissue swelling. Typically, this occurs over areas where tissue is already swollen to some extent, rather than over bony prominences [

         TIF causes symmetrical erythema, edema, and tenderness at the ankles and dorsa of the feet and, in severe cases, may cause fever and inguinal lymphadenopathy. While soft tissue infections may cause similar symptoms and signs, they are highly unlikely to present with symmetrical findings. Bacterial infections and dermatophytoses are more common than TIF after exposure to warm wet conditions for three or more days [

          Prehospital care

        </p>
        <p>
         If rescued in the prehyperemic stage, the patient should be carried and not allowed to walk if possible [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A vapor barrier, insulated wrap should be put over wet clothing initially to prevent or limit hypothermia. Remove wet clothing only after the patient is sheltered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treat frostbite, if present, before treating NFCI. The treatment of frostbite is discussed in detail separately (see

          "Frostbite: Emergency care and prevention"
         </a>
         ). Do not rewarm an extremity affected by NFCI unless frostbite is also present and portions of the extremity are still frozen. Affected limbs should never be rubbed.

         Treat systemic hypothermia by rewarming. Do not actively rewarm extremities with isolated NFCI. Examine the patient closely for other conditions and injuries. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Replace fluid losses, which may be substantial. Use isotonic intravenous fluids warmed to 42°C to both rehydrate and prevent hypothermia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Extremities with NFCI should be allowed to rewarm gradually with bed rest, elevation of the legs or hands, and air drying at room temperature [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Rapid rewarming increases pain and edema and is thought to increase the metabolic demands of injured skin [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         Continue any necessary emergency treatment (eg, rewarming, rehydration). Affected limbs should be elevated above the level of the heart and protected from constriction or mechanical damage (eg, cushions below feet). Affected limbs should be kept open to air or lightly and loosely dressed.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the prehyperemic stage, the extremity is numb. Once the hyperemic stage begins, it is necessary to control pain. Prophylactic treatment of pain prior to the hyperemic stage is ineffective. The clinical stages of NFCI are described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonfreezing cold injury'

        </p>
        <p>
         Cooling of the feet using a fan in a cool room (15 to 18°C) may be helpful to relieve pain during the hyperemic stage [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. This can be accomplished by putting a small fan on a bedside table and aiming it at the feet [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Early authors described lowering the temperature of the feet using ice bags with the feet wrapped in sterile towels [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. This seemed to be effective in relieving swelling and pain, but we recommend against this treatment because it risks worsening the injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids may be administered initially for pain relief but are usually ineffective. Vasodilators, such as

         NFCI is a clinical diagnosis; no specific imaging or laboratory studies are useful for establishing the diagnosis.

         Plain radiographs of the affected hands or feet should be obtained if traumatic injury is suspected.

Early surgical consultation is advisable if soft tissue infection is suspected.

Complete recovery including resolution of edema usually takes four to five days, although severely affected patients sometimes require as long as 10 to 12 days. Following desquamation, the skin becomes normal without vasomotor changes. There are no known long-term sequelae.

         Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated for the treatment of WWIF or TIF. Associated infections can be treated with topical antifungal agents for dermatophytoses or systemic antibiotics for bacterial cellulitis or deeper infection. (See

          COMPLICATIONS OF NONFREEZING COLD INJURY

          —
         </span>
         Short-term complications of nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) can include gangrene and infection of the affected area. When patients begin walking again, they often have a "slapping, flat-footed, springless gait" that improves in approximately a week [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Chronic pain and temperature sensitivity are among potential longer term complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third stage of NFCI begins hours to a few days after removal from the cold environment. (The stages of NFCI are described above (see
         <a class="local">
          'Nonfreezing cold injury'
         </a>
         above).) During this stage, severe pain with allodynia (hyperalgesia to light touch) develops, even in the absence of obvious tissue damage [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Pain is often worse at night. Conventional analgesics, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids, are usually ineffective.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8605" href="/z/d/drug information/8605.html" rel="external">
          Amitriptyline
         </a>
         , 50 to 100 mg given orally at bedtime, has been a standard treatment for pain in the United Kingdom armed forces since 1982 [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Higher doses can be given for breakthrough pain. Some centers start drugs to treat neuropathic pain early in the course of treatment [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. Medications such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">
          gabapentin
         </a>
         may be effective. There are no published clinical trials of regimens for pain control in patients with NFCI.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fourth stage of NFCI, following hyperemia, lasts for weeks to years. Long-term complications are due primarily to peripheral neurovascular injury, with associated abnormalities of sympathetic tone [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,29
         </a>
         ]. The severity of complications generally correlates with the severity of the original injury. The sequelae of NFCIs are similar but often more debilitating than those produced by frostbite. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/179.html" rel="external">
          "Frostbite: Emergency care and prevention", section on 'Complications'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Areas affected by NFCI often feel cold and experience prolonged episodes of vasoconstriction, especially after re-exposure to cold [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In addition, re-exposure to cold commonly causes pain [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Two small studies of soldiers with painful sequelae from NFCI identified a number of abnormalities in nerve and skin tissue and concluded that pain was due to sensory neuropathy or "vaso-neuropathy" [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. These complications are likely to be permanent except in mild cases. Pain may be provoked by walking [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Scaling ulceration and nail loss can occur intermittently without any obvious provoking injury or exposure. Patients with persistent pain and allodynia may develop complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5628.html" rel="external">
          "Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The descriptions above are born out in a case series of 76 patients diagnosed with NFCI [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. In six of the patients, symptoms resolved within a week of injury, but among patients seen in clinic a few months later, three-quarters complained that the affected extremity cooled more easily and had "abnormal sensation" when it was cold, while just over two-thirds reported that rewarming from the cold was painful. When the extremity was not cold, about one-third of patients continued to have "abnormal sensations," including paresthesias, and almost half had abnormal thermal sensation when touching things that were hot or cold. The most common clinical finding was "abnormal pinprick sensation," which was present in nearly 90 percent of patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic pain can vary depending on the circumstances of the original injury. The author has examined a patient who had to stand in cold water on a regular basis during combat. He subsequently developed severe arthropathy of all major joints below the shoulders, with the exception of the elbow on the arm he used to keep his rifle above water.
        </p>
        <p>
         Military personnel may not be able to redeploy after NFCI, especially not to cold environments [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Severely affected individuals may be unable to work outdoors [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. NFCI was a career-ending injury for 25 of 42 soldiers referred to a United Kingdom pain clinic for sequelae of NFCI [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The remaining personnel were downgraded to limit exposure to cold environments. Of the soldiers who were discharged, over half were unemployed at least partly due to needing to work in warm environments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although severe sequelae may be common, those with milder cases of NFCI generally recover. A study of 26 Norwegian soldiers with NFCI found that only seven developed chronic cold hypersensitivity [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. At two months after injury, 19 had numbness of the feet, 16 had cold hypersensitivity, and 7 were asymptomatic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hyperhidrosis is common and may lead to recurrent paronychial fungal infections. Nails may become thick and deformed. Sweating can be provoked by cold or heat or by emotional stimuli [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. In some cases, persistent, mild sensitivity to cold can be tolerable, but alternating pain and paresthesias, Raynaud syndrome, swelling, and chronic fungal infections may develop after many years [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         There is a paucity of evidence regarding measures to help prevent nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI). Many specific recommendations are based on prevention of other injuries. As one example, recommendations to air-dry feet for at least 8 of every 24 hours are based on studies of warm water immersion foot (WWIF) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,33
         </a>
         ], while suggestions to dry feet for 24 hours after every 48 hours of immersion has been suggested for tropical immersion foot (TIF) [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Trench foot was virtually eliminated among Allied forces along the Western Front during World War I when rations were increased and waterproof bags of clean, dry socks were sent nightly to the trenches along with the rations [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Prohibitions against applying puttees (wraps around the lower leg above the boots that caused constriction) and encouraging soldiers to move around as much as they could contributed to lower rates, as did the use of gum boots and foot powder rather than oils.
        </p>
        <p>
         Measures that may be used to reduce the risk of developing NFCI include the following:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If it is not possible to avoid cold, wet conditions, limit exposure as much as possible. In military settings, avoid re-exposing casualties who have previously sustained NFCI, especially if they are sensitized to cold.

         This is especially important for foot gear. Feet should be kept as dry as possible. Vapor barrier boots can be effective in retaining warmth and avoiding wet feet but can become wet from within.

          Terminology, epidemiology, and risk
         </strong>
         – Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) is a general term that includes trench foot and immersion foot. NFCI involves injury to the soft tissues, nerves, and vasculature of distal extremities from prolonged exposure (usually two to three days or longer) to wet, cold (but nonfreezing; generally 0 to 15°C or 32 to 59°F) conditions. Most often feet are involved  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101027" href="/z/d/graphic/101027.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), but the condition can affect any dependent body part. NFCI has been reported most often in combat soldiers, but other populations at risk include hikers, the homeless, heavy alcohol users, and older adults. (See

         Warm water immersion foot (WWIF) is a transient syndrome that manifests as painful, white, wrinkled soles of the feet due to immersion in warm water (15 to 32°C; 59 to 90°F) for up to 72 hours. Tropical immersion foot (TIF) is a more severe warm water immersion syndrome characterized by an inability to walk due to painful, swollen feet after immersion in warm water (22 to 32°C; 72 to 90°F) for over 72 hours  (

          Pathophysiology and clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – NFCI is characterized by impaired control of circulation and direct damage to the microcirculation, but the mechanism of cold and warm water immersion syndromes is poorly understood. The duration of a single exposure at a given temperature necessary to cause NFCI is not known, nor are there quantitative estimates of the effects of repeated exposure. Cold alone, without moisture, does not seem to be sufficient to cause NFCI. Immobility and malnutrition contribute to injury in many cases. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology of nonfreezing cold injury'

         Extremities with NFCI progress through a series of stages that can vary considerably in duration (see

         <strong>
          First stage: During cold exposure
         </strong>
         – Loss of sensation, usually complete anesthesia, is the key finding. Patients complain of "numbness." Due to diminished sensation and proprioception, patients may have difficulty walking. Extremities may be bright red at first but then become pale or completely white  (

         <strong>
          Second stage: Following cold exposure
         </strong>
         – This stage begins as soon as the patient is removed from the cold and continues during and after rewarming, usually lasting a few hours but possibly several days. Affected extremities become a mottled pale blue, reflecting a slight increase in blood flow (may be hard to see in darkly pigmented skin). Peripheral pulses are initially thready; subsequently, pulses become bounding, but capillary refill is delayed. The extremities continue to be cold and numb. Difficulty walking may persist.

         <strong>
          Third stage: Hyperemia
         </strong>
         – This stage typically begins abruptly and lasts for days to weeks. The affected extremity becomes bright red and edematous with bounding pulses but delayed capillary refill. Anesthesia is replaced by intense pain with hyperalgesia. Tissue damage is usually not apparent.

         <strong>
          Fourth stage: Following hyperemia
         </strong>
         – This stage may end after a few weeks, persist for years, or be permanent. The affected extremity usually appears normal, unless there has been tissue necrosis, which is uncommon. Affected extremities are cool and are often very sensitive to cold. Chronic pain, usually in response to cold, and hyperhidrosis are common. (See

         If present, treat systemic hypothermia before treating local cold injury. Examine the patient closely for other conditions and injuries. Assess extremities for frostbite and treat as necessary. (See

         Do not actively rewarm extremities with isolated NFCI. Rapid rewarming increases pain and edema. Extremities with NFCI should be allowed to rewarm gradually with bed rest, elevation of the legs or hands, and air-drying at room temperature.

         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids may be administered initially for pain relief but are usually not effective. We suggest treating pain as soon as it begins with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8605" href="/z/d/drug information/8605.html" rel="external">
          amitriptyline

          Grade 2C
