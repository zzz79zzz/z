         Cyclic neutropenia is a rare syndrome of recurrent neutropenia (typically every three weeks) and associated symptoms, including fever, malaise, mucosal ulcerations, and occasional abdominal discomfort; affected individuals are generally well between episodes. Cyclic neutropenia is associated with pathogenic variants (ie, mutations) of
         <em>
          ELANE
         </em>
         , the gene that encodes neutrophil elastase; pathologic variants of
         <em>
          ELANE
         </em>
         are also seen in most cases of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Previously, some patients with cyclic neutropenia and SCN were labeled as having Kostmann syndrome.

         The evaluation of neutropenia in adults, neutropenic disorders in children, and other causes of congenital neutropenia are discussed separately. (See

         Cyclic neutropenia is rare, with an estimated frequency of one case per million in the general population [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. It is most commonly detected in children, but some affected individuals are first recognized in adulthood. It is equally common in males and females. Together with a related disorder, severe congenital neutropenia, these conditions are the most common cause of neutropenia in children. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8373.html" rel="external">

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         Patients with cyclic neutropenia have a pathogenic variant (ie, mutation) of
         <em>
          ELANE
         </em>
         , the gene that encodes neutrophil elastase. Oscillating blood counts are caused by accelerated apoptosis of neutrophil precursors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cyclic neutropenia is associated with pathogenic variants that may occur throughout the
         <em>
          ELANE
         </em>
         genetic locus (on chromosome 19p13.3), but there is no strict correlation between genotype and phenotype [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3-5
         </a>
         ]. Many of the variants coincide with those associated with severe congenital neutropenia; the different phenotypes of these conditions suggest that other genetic features may influence the clinical manifestations [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism by which pathogenic variants of
         <em>
          ELANE
         </em>
         cause an oscillating pattern of neutropenia is not fully explained. Expression of neutrophil elastase is an early feature of granulocytic maturation and this proteolytic enzyme is packaged within primary granules of neutrophils [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Aberrant neutrophil elastase is thought to accelerate apoptosis of maturing neutrophil precursors due to insufficient inhibition or abnormal packaging. This results in cycling between apoptosis of early myeloid precursors (due to endoplasmic reticulum stress) and the compensatory response to neutropenia-induced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. These observations are consistent with mathematical models of hematopoiesis that predicted that oscillations in peripheral neutrophil counts would result from an aberrant feedback loop of G-CSF regulation of neutrophil production [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>

         The hallmark of the clinical presentation is recurrent neutropenia (typically every three weeks) with associated symptoms [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The average periodicity is 21 days and is usually consistent for an individual; however, cycle length can range from 14 to 35 days in different patients. Likewise, the duration of symptoms is typically consistent for an individual (generally days to one week) but may vary between patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         The severity of clinical manifestations often reflects the degree of neutropenia. By definition, the nadir of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13483.html" rel="external">

         cells/L). Symptoms tend to lag behind the neutropenia, so that neutrophil counts are usually about to recover when the individual starts to feel ill. Patients may report an increased sense of well-being as the neutrophil count recovers to &gt;500/microL [

         Symptoms of fever, malaise, oral ulcers, and mild sore throat every three weeks is the usual presentation of cyclic neutropenia. More than 60 percent of patients have inflammation of skin and oropharynx, cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and fatigue more than five times a year [

        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, &gt;60 percent of patients with cyclic neutropenia experienced ≥5 episodes per year of oral ulcers, gingivitis, lymphadenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, fatigue, or skin infections [

          9,12
         </a>
         ]. Parents or caregivers may state that the affected child does not appear well for two or three days of the cycle, whether or not there is documented fever. Serious neonatal infections and sepsis are rare. In adolescents and young adults, chronic gingivitis, dental abscesses, and alveolar bone loss are common. In adults, symptoms most often relate to sinusitis, headache, and bone pain; there are fewer skin infections, fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis.

         Patients with cyclic neutropenia are generally not at the same high risk for life-threatening infection as patients treated with chemotherapy, because of a shorter duration of neutropenia, lymphocyte-mediated immunity is not impaired, and they have active monocytosis during bouts of neutropenia.

         The greatest risk of death in patients with cyclic neutropenia is from necrotizing enterocolitis, peritonitis, or sepsis involving
         <em>
          Escherichia coli

         or
         <em>

         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         <em>
          Clostridioides
         </em>
         sepsis, cyclic neutropenia accounted in 30 percent of cases that were not caused by trauma; neutropenia due to chemotherapy accounted most of the other cases [

          15,16
         </a>

         History should document the occurrence of fever, inflammation of skin and oropharynx, respiratory tract complaints, sinus pain, cervical lymphadenopathy, perianal discomfort, and other infectious or inflammatory symptoms. A pattern of periodicity (eg, typically three weeks) should be noted; affected individuals are generally healthy between symptomatic periods. Family history should explore affected family members, though their clinical manifestations may vary in nature, severity, and periodicity. (See

         Examination of the oral mucosa may reveal gingival ulcers, inflammation, edema, and gum recession associated with recurrent infection and inflammation. Alveolar bone support may be lost in the preschool-age child, resulting in premature tooth mobility and loss  (

         There may be perirectal tenderness, ulceration, or abscess formation. The presence of abdominal discomfort, pain, or tenderness, especially during the neutropenic phase of the cycle, is an emergency that may reflect necrotizing enterocolitis, peritonitis, and other abdominal crises and requires urgent evaluation and management.

         Cyclic neutropenia must be distinguished from other causes of neutropenia and/or fever in children and adults. Cyclic neutropenia is distinguished from other conditions by its periodicity, resolution of symptoms between bouts, and absence of syndromic features (eg, short stature, dysmorphic features, chronic diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly). The approach to evaluation of neutropenia in adults and children are discussed separately. (See

         SCN typically presents within the first year of life with neutropenia and diarrhea, pneumonia, and/or abscesses in the lungs, liver, and subcutaneous tissues.

         For patients with cyclic neutropenia, we recommend treatment with G-CSF rather than observation alone, based on superior outcomes and modest toxicity. We generally treat with a continuous schedule of treatment, rather than episodic treatment (ie, attempting to synchronize with neutropenic cycles).
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of cyclic neutropenia generally requires daily or thrice-weekly (eg, Monday, Wednesday, Friday) subcutaneous injections of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8446" href="/z/d/drug information/8446.html" rel="external">
          filgrastim

         , starting at 2 to 3 mcg/kg/day [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Note that this dose is generally lower than that used for severe congenital neutropenia or chemotherapy-associated neutropenia, and it may require adjustment based on response to treatment. Trying to synchronize filgrastim treatment to coincide with the period of neutropenia is generally unsuccessful; G-CSF changes the periodicity of neutropenia and the patient will invariably get out of synch and end up being treated ineffectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of treatment with G-CSF is to maintain the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir ≥500/microL, which reduces the risk of severe infections and generally ameliorates gingivitis, mucosal ulceration, other infectious complications [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The dose may need to be adjusted to sustain that level of ANC throughout the cycle. Because levels of neutrophils fluctuate in cyclic neutropenia, ANC should be monitored periodically for several weeks after initiating G-CSF. Once an effective dose is established, we monitor the ANC every three to six months and do not alter the dose if the patient remains asymptomatic and the ANC is ≥500/microL. We find that monitoring the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be helpful; if the ESR is consistently normal, the average ANC has likely been adequate.

         (a long-acting pegylated formulation of G-CSF) is also effective and convenient, but it is difficult to dose appropriately in children and often leads to more severe bone pain [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         G-CSF is effective from as early as six months of age and treatment should continue lifelong, as needed. The dose can remain stable for years, even in growing children; as children grow, the dose of G-CSF should to be adjusted in accordance with symptoms and blood counts, rather than in response to body weight, per se. Neutrophil cycling may be replaced by a mild chronic neutropenia in the third decade of life; continued use of G-CSF may not be necessary unless the patient develops chronic gingivitis or other complications of neutropenia [

         Although granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been administered for severe chronic neutropenia, it is less effective than G-CSF and associated with more adverse effects [

         Treatment with G-CSF reduces infectious complications and increases neutrophil production in patients with chronic, severe neutropenia. Informative studies of G-CSF treatment for cyclic neutropenia and other causes of severe chronic neutropenia include:

         A prospective trial randomly assigned 120 patients (10 with cyclic neutropenia) with recurrent infections and diverse causes of severe chronic neutropenia (&lt;500/microL) to immediate treatment with G-CSF versus a four-month period of observation prior to treatment with G-CSF [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30

         ]. Compared with observation, treatment with G-CSF reduced the incidence and duration of infection-related events by 50 percent and the duration of antibiotic use by 70 percent. G-CSF increased bone marrow production of neutrophils and increased median ANC to &gt;1500/microL in 108 of 120 treated patients. G-CSF treatment was associated with generally mild bone pain, headache, and rash.

         Among 239 patients with cyclic neutropenia who were followed prospectively in the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR), compared with no treatment, use of G-CSF reduced the probability of sepsis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.20; 95% CI 0.05-0.88) and was safe [

There were no reported cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after nearly 3000 patient-years of treatment with G-CSF. In other reports, G-CSF led to a 10- to 20-fold increase in mean ANC, prevented infections, and was safe in patients with cyclic neutropenia [

         Infectious diseases – It is important to maintain age-appropriate schedules of immunizations. There is no need to avoid public places since most severe infections are associated with organisms in the intestinal biome.

        </p>
        <p>
         Cyclic neutropenia is an autosomal dominant disorder. Women considering pregnancy should be counseled that there is a 50 percent chance that offspring will inherit the pathogenic variant and that manifestations in children may be either more or less severe than those in the proband. We do not counsel against pregnancy in women with cyclic neutropenia, but we indicate the availability of prenatal diagnostic testing for
         <em>
          ELANE
         </em>
         pathogenic variants. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For women with cyclic neutropenia who become pregnant, we suggest continuing G-CSF rather than discontinuing it, based on its safety during pregnancy for mother and fetus and the potential to reduce infectious complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         G-CSF can be administered during pregnancy without apparent adverse consequence, but no controlled studies of pregnant women with cyclic neutropenia have prospectively compared treatment with G-CSF versus no treatment. An observational study that included women with congenital, cyclic, idiopathic, or autoimmune neutropenia compared maternal and neonatal outcomes among 100 women who received G-CSF during pregnancy versus 124 women who did not receive G-CSF [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. There were no differences between the groups with regard to spontaneous terminations, preterm labor, or other adverse events and no differences in gestational age, birth weight, or neutropenia for the neonates. Maternal minor infections (eg, cellulitis, mastitis, perirectal infection, pneumonia) occurred in both groups; each group had one severe infection (bacteremia, sepsis). G-CSF was administered in the first trimester of 82 of 100 pregnancies and was not associated with adverse events. Among the 44 women with cyclic neutropenia or severe congenital neutropenia, outcomes from the 183 pregnancies resulted in equivalent infant health between the treated and untreated women.

         In most cases of cyclic neutropenia there are other affected family members, and the pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant. However, family members may exhibit a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to recurrent life-threatening infections, which is more consistent with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) [

Affected family members may have a similar clinical presentation to the proband, or the neutropenia may differ in severity, cycle duration, degree of fluctuation, or associated clinical manifestations.

         Most patients diagnosed with cyclic neutropenia have an affected parent. In some cases, neither parent appears to be affected clinically or has the pathogenic variant of the proband.

         Cyclic neutropenia is a rare syndrome in which the neutrophil count oscillates approximately every three weeks, paralleled by fever, skin and oral ulcerations, and/or cervical adenopathy; affected individuals are generally healthy between episodes.

         Cyclic neutropenia is associated with pathogenic variants (ie, mutation) of
         <em>
          ELANE

         , the gene that encodes neutrophil elastase, but the mechanism by which they cause a cyclic pattern of neutropenia is incompletely understood. (See

         The hallmark of the clinical presentation is a predictable pattern of recurrent neutropenia with associated symptoms that typically include recurrent fever, inflammation of skin and oropharynx, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The periodicity of findings is approximately three weeks, and affected individuals are generally well between episodes. Individuals usually present within the first year of life, and symptoms generally improve in adulthood. (See

         The history should evaluate fever, skin and oropharyngeal inflammation, cervical adenopathy, and other infectious or inflammatory findings; explore a pattern of periodicity; and determine if there are affected family members. Physical examination should include examination of the gingiva, oral mucosa, and perianal region. (See

         Cyclic neutropenia must be distinguished from other causes of severe neutropenia and/or fever in children and adults. Cyclic neutropenia is distinguished by its periodicity, resolution of symptoms between bouts, and absence of syndromic features. The differential diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia includes severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and other inherited causes of neutropenia, syndromes of periodic fever, constitutional neutropenia, and various acquired causes for neutropenia (eg, infectious, autoimmune, inflammatory, nutritional, toxic, and malignant disorders) in children and adults.

         For patients with cyclic neutropenia, we recommend treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) rather than observation alone (

          Grade 1B

         ), based on the reduction of serious infections and its modest toxicity. We generally treat with a continuous schedule of administration, rather than episodic treatment that attempts to synchronize with neutropenic cycles. The dose should be adjusted as needed to maintain the ANC nadir &gt;500/microL and control associated symptoms. Treatment should continue lifelong, as needed. The primary adverse reaction is musculoskeletal pain, but this is generally mild and typically lessens with repeated injections. (See
