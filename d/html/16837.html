         Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an inborn error of immunity characterized by dysregulation of the immune system due to an inability to control lymphocyte homeostasis through the process of lymphocyte apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The consequences include lymphoproliferative disease, manifested by lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and an increased risk of lymphoma, as well as autoimmune disease, typically involving blood cells.
        </p>

         ALPS due to germline pathogenic variants in the Fas cell surface death receptor (
         <em>
          FAS

         ) gene that encodes an apoptosis-associated antigen (ALPS-FAS) is the most common and best-characterized type of ALPS, although it is nonetheless a rare condition. (See

         ALPS typically manifests in the first years of life. The most common presenting clinical manifestations are noninfectious, nonmalignant lymphoid expansion with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly and autoimmune cytopenias, including thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Lymphoma is a late complication. All disease manifestations appear to be more common in males than females [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the two largest cohorts of patients with ALPS, a French cohort and a cohort from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), disease onset was most commonly marked by lymphoproliferation with generalized adenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly at a median age of 2.7 to 3 years [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Patients with later disease onset often presented with autoimmune manifestations rather than lymphoproliferative disease.

         </span>
         Expansion and persistence of lymphocyte populations that are not eliminated through apoptosis result in chronic lymphadenopathy that typically fluctuates and most often involves the cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodal chains; splenomegaly with or without premature destruction of blood cells (hypersplenism); and, less frequently, hepatomegaly. The lymphoproliferation typically manifests in the first years of life in individuals with ALPS-FAS. In some persons, splenomegaly is the predominant or only manifestation of lymphoproliferation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Lymphadenopathy tends to decrease in the second decade of life, whereas splenomegaly often does not. The overall prognosis of lymphoproliferation is relatively good, and few patients require long-term treatment with immunosuppressive agents. A frequent cause of death in patients treated with splenectomy is sepsis; therefore, splenectomy should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the French and NIH cohorts, chronic lymphadenopathy was present in 85 and 97 percent, respectively, while splenomegaly was present in approximately 95 percent in both cohorts (with 73 percent showing evidence of hypersplenism).
        </p>
        <p>
         Long-term follow-up has shown that resolution of lymphadenopathy is not always accompanied by significant changes in the overall expansion of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The lymphoproliferation waxes and wanes for reasons that are not entirely clear. Intercurrent viral and bacterial infections can influence lymphadenopathy, but both increased and decreased intensity of lymphoproliferative manifestations have been observed with infections, making it difficult to predict the effect of infection or to understand the mechanism responsible.

          Autoimmunity

         Autoimmunity is a common feature of ALPS [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. It is typically limited to the hematopoietic system, but other organs (eg, liver, kidneys) are sometimes involved. Autoimmunity can be the first ALPS manifestation, although it is not always present at the time of diagnosis or at the time of the most extensive lymphoproliferation. Autoimmune manifestations wax and wane, although experience suggests that autoimmune disease poses a lifelong risk and burden. In many patients, the occurrence of autoimmunity signifies the transition from ALPS without the need for immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulating therapy into ALPS requiring long-term and/or intermittent therapy, which has a less favorable prognosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combinations of cytopenias (also known as Evans syndrome) that occur concomitantly and/or sequentially are typical, with Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) the most common combination, followed by ITP and autoimmune neutropenia (AIN). Autoimmune cytopenias may be difficult to distinguish from the effects of concomitant hypersplenism. Other types of autoimmunity are also seen. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7078.html" rel="external">
          "Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in adults"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In both the French and NIH cohorts, there was roughly a two- to three-year delay between disease onset (lymphoproliferation) and clinically significant autoimmunity [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. The reason for this delay is unclear but may be related to age-dependent acquisition of secondary pathogenic factors or sequential exposures to infectious agents during infancy and early childhood. In many persons, autoantibodies can be detected before clinical evidence of autoimmune disease, and it is possible that certain patients never develop overt autoimmune disease despite the presence of autoantibodies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Autoimmune cytopenias were present in 52 percent of patients in the French cohort, and autoimmune disease of any variety was found in 61 percent, giving a risk of overall autoimmune disease development before the age of 30 years of 72 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 69 percent of patients in the NIH cohort developed at least one episode of autoimmune cytopenia [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, ALPS is common in patients with Evans syndrome (presence of ≥2 cytopenias), even in those without significant lymphoproliferation, and was seen in approximately half of patients in one series [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Nearly all these patients had elevated numbers of double-negative T (DNT) cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examination of blood smears for evidence of hemolysis, measurement of autoantibodies, and the degree of reticulocytosis may help in distinguishing autoimmune cytopenias from the effects of hypersplenism, as well as the fact that autoimmune cytopenias often manifest clinically (eg, with bleeding). This also helps in distinguishing ALPS-related ITP from idiopathic ITP, which can be experienced without significant bleeding issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional autoimmune features are seen in ALPS, often in patterns that appear to be family specific, suggesting the influence of other modifying genes [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. These features include glomerulonephritis, autoimmune hepatitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, uveitis, and iridocyclitis. Autoimmunity affecting endocrine systems or joints is not common in ALPS compared with other immunodeficiency disorders.

          Lymphoma

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Persons with ALPS-FAS are at an increased risk for both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL and NHL), underscoring the role of
         <em>
          FAS
         </em>
         as a tumor-suppressor gene, although other malignancies are not more common. Lymphoma can develop at any age in ALPS-FAS but is rare as a presenting feature. Distinguishing a "good" node from a "bad" node is a diagnostic challenge because of the frequent concomitant presence of benign (ie, "typical") lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly seen with ALPS. Important clues for lymphoma are B type symptoms including fever, night sweats, itching, and weight loss. Lymphoma typically originates in the B cell lineage, but T cell lymphomas have also occurred. Lymphoma is infrequently related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, based upon absence of EBV in tumor biopsies. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16614.html" rel="external">
          "Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS): Management and prognosis", section on 'Evaluation for lymphoma'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In an earlier study, the calculated increased risk was 14-fold and 51-fold for NHL and HL, respectively [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The cumulative risk of lymphoma before the age of 30 years was 15 percent in the French cohort (three cases of HL and four cases of NHL out of a total of 90 patients) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In the NIH cohort, 18 cases of lymphoma out of a total of 150 patients were identified with a median age of detection of 18 years [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The male-to-female ratio was 3.5 to 1. Sixteen of 18 cases were of B cell origin, and 17 of 18 cases occurred in patients with pathogenic variants affecting the death domain of Fas. Using published expected cases of HL and NHL in the general population, the 16 cases of B cell lymphoma conferred a significantly increased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 149 for HL and 61 for NHL, respectively [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of studies have looked at associations between Fas and neoplasms, including somatic variants in solid tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-16
         </a>
         ]. However, there is no indication that there is an increased risk for malignancies other than lymphoma.

         Much less can be said with certainty with respect to the other germline ALPS genotypes (ALPS due to variants in the genes for Fas ligand or caspase 10, ALPS-FASLG and ALPS-CASP10) and somatic ALPS-FAS since there are only a few cases.

         ALPS-FASLG has features distinctly different from typical ALPS due to

         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, activation-induced cell death (AICD) is diminished, and, less consistently, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function is abnormal.

         ALPS-CASP10 has autosomal dominant inheritance [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22

One patient had recurrent noninvasive skin infections, oral aphthous ulcers, arthralgia, and failure to thrive [

         <em>
          FAS

         In patients with ALPS, there is expansion of alpha beta double-negative T (DNT) cells in the peripheral blood and tissues. These cells express the alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR) CD3 complex but lack both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. Detected by flow cytometric immunophenotyping, these terminally differentiated, in vivo-activated T cells are rare in healthy persons and those with other immune-mediated (lymphoproliferative) disorders, typically &lt;1 percent of the lymphocyte pool compared with 2 to 23 percent DNT cells in patients with ALPS [

         As part of the lymphoproliferative aspect of ALPS, other lymphocyte subsets are expanded as well. Immunophenotypically, these include gamma delta DNT cells, CD8+CD57+ T cells, as well as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR+ T cells and B cells that express CD5 and lack CD27. Not all lymphocyte subsets are expanded, however, as patients show decreased numbers of CD4+CD25+ T cells and decreased numbers of CD27+ B cells. In rare patients, lymphopenia is observed instead of the typical lymphocytosis (independent of immunosuppressive therapy).

          30,31,34
         </a>
         ]. These biomarkers vary in their degree of ALPS specificity. As an example, IL-10 is ALPS specific, but IL-18 it not. These biomarkers seem to perform better when evaluated in combination and/or when other biomarkers (eg, IL-10 and IL-6) are absent. The Fas-mediated apoptosis assay is conducted on separated lymphocytes and measures the ability of stimulated T cells to undergo cell death by apoptosis upon ligation of cell surface Fas. There are also increased levels of soluble IL-18, CD25, CD27, and CD30, but these may not be specific for ALPS [

         The immune system is largely intact as far as T cell and natural killer (NK) cell functions are concerned.

         A wide repertoire of autoantibodies can be present and most often includes a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) test; antiplatelet, antineutrophil, antiphospholipid, and antinuclear antibodies; and rheumatoid factor. Autoantibodies are typically of the IgG subclass and of high affinity, in contrast to naturally occurring autoantibodies of the same specificity that are low affinity and IgM derived. Hematologically, Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia with reticulocytosis, dyserythropoiesis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia is observed in most patients, although often not at the time of ALPS diagnosis.

         The preferred approach is to sequence all ALPS-related genes concurrently. This can be done by ordering an ALPS gene panel testing, if available, or ordering testing for each gene separately. The ALPS panels typically include both ALPS genes (

         ,

         and
         <em>
          XIAP
         </em>
         ). This testing determines the presence of a germline variant in unsorted cells obtained from blood or other tissues. The diagnosis of ALPS due to a specific genetic defect is established if a germline pathogenic variant is identified. With next-generation sequencing genetic testing modalities, somatic pathogenic variants in these genes may be detected if the level of mosaicism is high enough.

         One question that frequently comes up regarding diagnostic testing has to do with the impact of immunosuppressive drugs. A rough rule of thumb is that the impact is related to the potency and duration of immunosuppressive therapy. As examples, a short burst of glucocorticoids, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         , may not alter the DNT cell compartment and/or ALPS biomarkers, while drugs that are often used chronically in ALPS therapy, particularly
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10329" href="/z/d/drug information/10329.html" rel="external">
          sirolimus

          mycophenolate
         </a>
         , can largely normalize laboratory values and/or interfere in Fas-mediated apoptosis assays. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16614.html" rel="external">
          "Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS): Management and prognosis", section on 'Autoimmune manifestations'

        </p>
        <p>
         Depending upon the particular situation, one can follow the abovementioned testing algorithm, keeping in mind that a lack of DNT cells or ALPS biomarkers may not be reliable. If the clinical condition permits discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs, the diagnostic process can be delayed until that time. Conversely,
         <em>
          FAS
         </em>
         can be sequenced if continued immunosuppressive therapy is required and there is a strong suspicion of ALPS since this test will capture the vast majority of patients with ALPS. Confirmation of ALPS-sFAS, the second most common type of ALPS, requires sorting DNT cells, which may not be feasible if the DNT cell compartment is reduced by immunosuppressive drugs. In this case, testing may be performed at a later date if discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications in the future is possible.

         Germline ALPS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, although rare cases of compound heterozygous or homozygous variants have been reported in patients with severe disease of early, even congenital, onset [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Thus, offspring of males or females affected with germline ALPS have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition, although penetrance and expressivity vary even in family members with the same variant. Somatic ALPS is generally not heritable, since it is restricted to hematopoietic cells.

         Performance of the Fas-mediated apoptosis assay, if available, is suggested only after ALPS-FAS, ALPS-sFAS, ALPS-CASP10, and ALPS-FASLG have been ruled out  (

          algorithm 1

         ). This is due to the complex and labor-intensive nature of the assay, which can take up several weeks of culturing. However, there is a novel Fas-mediated apoptosis assay based upon differential sensitivity of memory T cells versus naïve T cells that can be completed in one to two days instead of several weeks and can identify patients with ALPS who have germline or somatic defects [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

        </p>
        <p>
         A second area of investigational testing has grown out of the observation of cumulative genetic defects in ALPS patients, which lead to the presence of somatic loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Thus, measurement of Fas surface expression on T cells, particularly DNT cells, may allow detection of LOH. (See

         The main considerations in the differential diagnosis are more common but self-limited viral infections, other immunodeficiency disorders characterized or complicated by lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease (particularly autoimmune cytopenias), and lymphoma [

         ]. While a number of acquired viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be confused with ALPS, double-negative T (DNT) cells associated with infections predominantly express gamma delta rather than alpha beta T cell receptors (TCRs). Evans syndrome is sometimes considered a specific entity. However, it should be regarded as a descriptive term, meaning the presence of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), either concomitantly and/or sequentially. Even if a primary diagnosis cannot be made, Evans syndrome should be regarded as a constellation of manifestations of an underlying immunologic/hematologic disorder (such as ALPS). In that context, inborn errors of immunity can present with lymphoproliferation, including lymphoma, and autoimmune cytopenias. With this in mind, the differential diagnosis includes the following.

         FAS-associated protein with death domain (FADD) deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive condition that is not part of ALPS classification, mostly due to the fact that only seven patients have been reported [

These include an expansion of DNT cells; increased levels of biomarkers (interleukin [IL] 10, soluble Fas ligand [FasL], and vitamin B12); and, importantly, abnormal in vitro Fas-mediated apoptosis. These patients may have a unique susceptibility to recurrent viral infections because FADD has a role in Toll-like receptor (TLR) independent innate immune responses [

         Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is an inborn error of immunity characterized by impaired B cell differentiation or function with defective immunoglobulin production. It is the most prevalent form of severe antibody deficiency affecting both children and adults, hence the term "common." "Variable" refers to the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of this disorder, which include recurrent infections, chronic lung disease, autoimmune disorders, gastrointestinal disease, and a heightened susceptibility to lymphoma. The underlying causes of CVID are not known for most patients, although specific molecular defects are being identified in a growing subset of patients. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         From a clinical and immunologic standpoint, CVID can be roughly classified into two groups, depending upon the presence or absence of mature B cells in peripheral blood. Individuals with CVID who have mature B cells but absent or decreased memory B cells are at an increased risk for autoimmune disease that often targets blood cells and for chronic lymphoproliferation including lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and lymphoma [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43-45
         </a>
         ]. A reduction in memory B cells is also seen in some patients with ALPS [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. CVID with preservation of B cells should be regarded in the differential diagnosis of ALPS [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

         ], while CVID characterized by low or absent B cells and generally low serum concentrations of immunoglobulins should not.
        </p>
        <p>
         CVID can be differentiated from ALPS based upon clinical manifestations, particularly the lack of infections in ALPS; laboratory features (eg, hypogammaglobulinemia in CVID contrasting with hypergammaglobulinemia in ALPS, lack of DNT cells, etc); and genetic testing (identification of an ALPS-related genotype or, conversely, identification of a CVID-associated genotype).

         Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on regulatory T (Treg) cells. Haploinsufficiency of CTLA-4 causes dysregulation of forkhead box P3 positive (FoxP3+) Treg cells and hyperactivation of effector T cells, resulting in severe loss of tolerance and infiltrative autoimmune disease [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         ]. Clinical features include lymphoproliferation; lymphocytic infiltration of nonlymphoid organs (eg, brain, lungs, gastrointestinal tract); autoimmune cytopenias (eg, autoimmune hemolytic anemia [AIHA], autoimmune thrombocytopenia); CD4+ T cell lymphopenia; and B cell abnormalities with increased CD21

         CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency can be difficult to distinguish from ALPS. As with CVID (see
         <a class="local">
          'Common variable immunodeficiency'
         </a>
         above), reduced levels of serum immunoglobulins, lack of DNT cells, and targeted genetic testing should make this differentiation possible. In addition, lymphocytic infiltration of nonlymphoid organs appears to be more common in CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency. (In daily practice, the presence of pulmonary nodules, detected by imaging studies, points away from ALPS and towards CTLA-4 defects.)

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a rare disorder characterized by defective lymphocyte homeostasis, resulting from defective Fas-mediated apoptosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – ALPS typically manifests in the first years of life. The most common early clinical manifestations are lymphoid expansion with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly and autoimmune disease with blood cytopenias including thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. A late complication is lymphoma. Patients who have undergone splenectomy are prone to life-threatening sepsis; thus, splenectomy is to be avoided in ALPS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations of ALPS-FAS'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Laboratory findings
         </strong>
         – The signature laboratory abnormality unique to ALPS is the presence of T cells that express the alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR) but lack both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors (alpha beta double-negative T [DNT] cells) in peripheral blood or tissue specimens. Other immunologic laboratory findings that are typical and unique to ALPS include abnormal Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro, increased levels of interleukin (IL) 10 in serum/plasma, and increased blood levels of vitamin B12, IL-18, and soluble Fas ligand (FasL). Hematologic findings include Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia with reticulocytosis and hyperbilirubinemia, dyserythropoiesis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia. (See

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of ALPS is based upon strict criteria  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96876" href="/z/d/graphic/96876.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ) that include required clinical findings (lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly) and laboratory abnormalities including presence of alpha beta DNT cells, as well as accessory features such as elevated levels of ALPS biomarkers (vitamin B12, IL-10, IL-18, and soluble FasL), defective in vitro Fas-mediated apoptosis, and identification of variants in genes relevant for the Fas pathway of apoptosis including Fas, Fas ligand, and caspase 10 (
         <em>

         ,
         <em>

         , and
         <em>

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The main considerations in the differential diagnosis are more common but self-limited viral infections, other immunodeficiency disorders characterized or complicated by lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease (particularly autoimmune cytopenias), and lymphoma. Inborn errors of immunity include common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) haploinsufficiency, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responsive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) deficiency disease, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gain-of-function disease, hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (HIGM), X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease, Ras-associated lymphoproliferative disease, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Both B cell and T cell lymphoma should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of ALPS. (See
