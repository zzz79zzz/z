These abscesses typically originate as simple infections that develop in the vulvar skin or subcutaneous tissues. Spread of infection and abscess formation in the vulvar area is facilitated by the loose areolar tissue in the subcutaneous layers and the contiguity of the vulvar fascial planes with the groin and anterior abdominal wall.</p><p>The microbiology, diagnosis, and management of vulvar abscesses are discussed here. Bartholin gland abscesses and other vulvar lesions are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5492.html" rel="external">"Bartholin gland masses"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5450.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Diagnostic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5575.html" rel="external">"Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The external female genitalia are referred to as the vulva (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614" href="/d/graphic/72614.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Skin and glands</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hair follicles and sweat and sebaceous glands of the vulvar skin are common sites of infection and abscess formation. The mons pubis and labia majora are covered with hair, while the labia minora are not.</p><p>Two major vulvar glands underlie the vestibule; these are the Bartholin glands (also referred to as the greater vestibular gland) and the paraurethral (Skene) glands. The Bartholin glands drain through the Bartholin ducts, located bilaterally in the vestibule at approximately the four and eight o'clock positions with respect to the vaginal introitus. The paraurethral glands empty through paraurethral (Skene) ducts, which are located bilaterally just inferior and lateral to the urethral meatus (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614" href="/d/graphic/72614.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64605" href="/d/graphic/64605.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Fascia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The contiguity of vulvar fascial spaces with other anatomic compartments permits spread of infection from the vulva to the inner thigh, abdominal wall, or ischiorectal fossa [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>The superficial fascia of the mons and labia majora, referred to as Camper fascia, contains a mesh of adipose tissue and loose, areolar connective tissue (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64605" href="/d/graphic/64605.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). This layer is contiguous with the superficial fascia of the inner thighs and anterior abdominal wall.</p><p>The superficial perineal (Colle) fascia comprises the deeper layer of vulvar fascia and contains a thin, aponeurotic mesh contiguous with Scarpa fascia in the abdominal wall [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. The space between Colle fascia and the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm is called the superficial perineal space, and houses the vestibular bulbs and Bartholin glands [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Overlying these glands, but still deep to Colle fascia, is the bulbospongiosus (bulbocavernosus) muscle (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64605" href="/d/graphic/64605.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">TYPES OF VULVAR ABSCESS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Skin and hair follicle infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The skin and hair follicles of the vulvar surface are subject to infections common to these structures in other parts of the body, and can be treated in the same manner. These include folliculitis, skin abscesses, furuncles, and carbuncles. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5412.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of vesicles, bullae, erosions, and ulcers"</a>.)</p><p>Hidradenitis suppurativa also commonly affects the vulva and can be a nidus for infection that may progress to abscess. Diagnosis and treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5575.html" rel="external">"Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7605.html" rel="external">"Hidradenitis suppurativa: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Bartholin gland abscess</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bartholin gland cysts, which form when the duct openings are obstructed, are the most common vulvar mass [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These cysts can evolve into abscesses, which require treatment. Bartholin gland abscesses are confined to the gland and do not spread elsewhere in the vulva. Management of Bartholin gland abscesses is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5492.html" rel="external">"Bartholin gland masses"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15317576"><span class="h2">Paraurethral (Skene) gland abscess</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are few reports of abscesses of the paraurethral glands [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Skin and glands'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Wound or hematoma infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a vulvar wound due to an obstetric laceration or vulvar surgery may develop a wound infection; this may progress to form an abscess. In addition, obstetric or other vulvar trauma may result in a hematoma, which can become infected and form an abscess. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5399.html" rel="external">"Repair of perineal lacerations associated with childbirth"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6715.html" rel="external">"Management of hematomas incurred as a result of obstetric delivery"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vulvar abscesses, including Bartholin gland abscesses, are often mixed polymicrobial infections, consisting primarily of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), enteric gram-negative aerobes, and female lower genital tract anaerobes [<a href="#rid1">1,4-6,10-14</a>]. The microbiology of vulvar abscesses is discussed in this section; Bartholin gland abscesses are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5492.html" rel="external">"Bartholin gland masses", section on 'Types of masses'</a>.)</p><p>The vulvar skin is colonized with organisms found on the skin and in the vagina and rectum. <em>S. aureus</em>, streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative enteric organisms are commonly isolated from vulvar abscesses [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Anaerobic bacteria, such as Peptostreptococcus or beta-lactamase-producing anaerobes (eg, <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em>) may also be present in this polymicrobial infection [<a href="#rid6">6,15,16</a>].</p><p>MRSA is the most common pathogen among vulvar abscesses that require incision and drainage [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. There are no data regarding abscesses that do not require incision and drainage, since they are rarely cultured. The largest case series of vulvar abscesses included 162 patients at a county hospital in Texas who underwent incision and drainage [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. MRSA was isolated in 64 percent of cases; the remaining cultures grew "usual vaginal flora," including group B streptococci, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and Enterococcus species.</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with other United States studies showing that MRSA can be present in cultures of the vagina and rectum taken during routine obstetric care and that MRSA is the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infections at other body sites [<a href="#rid10">10-12,17,18</a>]. Athletes, military recruits, and children in day care are at increased risk for MRSA skin infections. Other risk factors include injection drug use and poor hygiene. A case series of three households suggests that heterosexual contact may be a risk for MRSA genital infections [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> in vulvar abscesses other than Bartholin gland abscesses [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of vulvar abscesses other than Bartholin gland abscesses is unknown.</p><p>Many patients with vulvar abscesses have no apparent risk factors. Risk factors for the development of vulvar abscesses include [<a href="#rid1">1,4,16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obesity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Poor hygiene</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Shaving or waxing of pubic hair (eg, vulvar trauma)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunocompromise (eg, diabetes, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, immunosuppressant therapy)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms typically develop over the course of several days and persist until the abscess is treated.</p><p>Patients typically report a painful vulvar mass, sometimes described by patients as a "pimple" or a "spider bite." In addition, they may also complain of vulvar fullness or pressure, or pain with walking, sitting, or sexual intercourse [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Pain beyond local tenderness is not typically associated with a vulvar abscess and, particularly in immunocompromised patients, may raise suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">"Necrotizing soft tissue infections", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>There are few data regarding how often vulvar abscess is accompanied by fever. In one study, fewer than 10 percent of patients with vulvar abscesses had an associated temperature ≥100.4°F [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of vulvar abscess is based on the finding on physical examination of a tender, often fluctuant vulvar mass with surrounding erythema and possible edema and/or induration (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60868" href="/d/graphic/60868.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Evaluation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15317659"><span class="h3">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vital signs are measured to assess for fever and hemodynamic stability, particularly in patients who report fever, are ill-appearing, or are immunocompromised.</p><p>The site of the suspected vulvar abscess is examined. The vulva should be visually inspected and the mass palpated. Signs consistent with an abscess (tender mass, fluctuance, erythema, edema, induration) should be noted. The size of the abscess should be measured and documented; this information is useful to assess response to therapy. The extent of the mass should be assessed by visualization of any vaginal component with a speculum examination and with palpation of the mass with a bimanual pelvic examination. Any mass that does not have findings typical for an abscess should be evaluated further, as appropriate. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15317701"><span class="h3">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the increasing prevalence of resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>, aerobic and anaerobic cultures should routinely be collected. Since vulvar abscesses other than Bartholin gland abscesses are not caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia, testing for these infections is not part of the evaluation [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In abscesses that require incision and drainage, cultures are collected after the initial incision. Cultures are collected by needle aspiration at the leading edge of cellulitis if no incision is planned.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation to evaluate for bacteremia and sepsis is required in the few patients who develop systemic illness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2133.html" rel="external">"Detection of bacteremia: Blood cultures and other diagnostic tests"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15317713"><span class="h3">Other tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radiographic data do not generally contribute to the diagnosis since the extent of the abscess is typically palpable on examination. The extent of deeper abscesses is evaluated during incision and drainage. If spread of infection beyond the vulva is suspected, imaging with ultrasound or computed tomography may be utilized [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In the pediatric population, some experts use translabial ultrasound to differentiate cellulitis from a drainable abscess. This may be helpful in avoiding an unnecessary operative procedure.</p><p>Biopsy of the lesion is appropriate for patients in whom malignancy is suspected. It is generally recommended that patients over age 40 with a Bartholin cyst or abscess undergo drainage and biopsy of the gland to exclude the possibility of an underlying carcinoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5492.html" rel="external">"Bartholin gland masses", section on 'Types of masses'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15317614"><span class="h2">Differential diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of a vulvar abscess includes infectious and noninfectious vulvar masses and lesions. Abscesses are generally singular and present as a palpable mass rather than an ulcer or flat lesion (macule, patch, plaque) and may begin small, but are larger than a papule. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5412.html" rel="external">"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of vesicles, bullae, erosions, and ulcers"</a>.)</p><p>Other infections of the vulva include vulvovaginitis, which does not present with a mass or rarely presents with erythema. Genital herpes simplex infection causes painful papules, but these are too small to be abscesses. Necrotizing fasciitis, although rare, should be suspected in a woman who has a vulvar abscess and/or persistent vulvar pain combined with erythema or induration. (See <a class="local">'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Noninfectious masses are typically nontender and nonerythematous (eg, Bartholin gland cyst, epidermoid cyst). Notable exceptions to this are vulvar nodules due to hidradenitis suppurativa, which are painful and often progress to form an abscess. Vulvar cancer may present as a firm mass or lesion with surrounding erythema. A biopsy should be performed if there is suspicion of a cancer or precancerous lesion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2874755"><span class="h2">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of vulvar abscess depends upon the lesion size and the patient's risk factors for failure of therapy or systemic infection. The general principles of management are the same regardless of the type of vulvar abscess.</p><p>Small lesions often resolve with conservative therapy (eg, warm compresses); however, incision and drainage is the mainstay of treatment of vulvar abscesses [<a href="#rid1">1,22</a>]. Antibiotics are required in some cases [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2874722"><span class="h3">Indications for referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lesions that are appropriate for conservative therapy (eg, warm compresses) may be treated by any primary care clinician (see <a class="local">'Conservative therapy'</a> below). Incision and drainage requires a clinician who has experience with vulvar procedures.</p><p>Consultation with an advanced pelvic surgeon may be required if the abscess extends into the mons pubis and/or into the medial aspect of the thigh or if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2873935"><span class="h2">Small abscesses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first line of therapy for most patients with a small vulvar abscess (&lt;2 cm) is conservative therapy (eg, warm compresses or sitz baths). Antibiotic therapy may be used in combination with conservative measures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2874343"><span class="h3">Conservative therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Small vulvar abscesses (&lt;2 cm) that have yet to point to the skin surface ("come to a head") are treated with warm compresses or sitz baths three to four times per day. If the lesion does not resolve after a week or if the lesion points to the skin's surface, incision and drainage will hasten resolution [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>For immunocompromised patients, conservative management should be used <strong>only</strong> for abscesses that are too small for incision and drainage.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2874507"><span class="h3">Antibiotics combined with conservative therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial treatment of a small vulvar abscess with conservative therapy alone is reasonable. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated if the lesion does not improve after two days of conservative therapy or if the patient is immunosuppressed. (See <a class="local">'Immunocompromised patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Choice of antimicrobial agent is the same as for patients who have undergone incision and drainage and is discussed in detail below. (See <a class="local">'Antimicrobial agents'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2874523"><span class="h3">Incision and drainage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with small abscesses (&lt;2 cm), we perform incision and drainage if the patient is immunosuppressed, if the lesion is still present after one week, or if it points to the skin surface.

Occasionally, a vulvar abscess will require extensive debridement in an inpatient setting. When extensive debridement is anticipated, an experienced pelvic surgeon should perform the procedure.</p><p>Inpatient incision and drainage under regional or general anesthesia is preferred if an abscess is very large (≥5 cm), if there is suspicion that the abscess may extend to another anatomic compartment (eg, thigh, anterior abdominal wall), or in immunocompromised patients. If there is a potential for postdrainage complications, we also admit the patient for postoperative observation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h4">Procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aspects of incision and drainage specific to vulvar abscess are discussed here. General principles of incision and drainage of a skin abscess can be found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6336.html" rel="external">"Techniques for skin abscess drainage"</a>.)</p><p>Incision and drainage of a vulvar abscess is performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Local anesthetic is injected at the planned incision site and around the base of the abscess. A pudendal block is not recommended, since it does not anesthetize the anterior aspect of the perineum and is often ineffective. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5404.html" rel="external">"Pudendal and paracervical block"</a>.)</p><p>For drainage of abscesses that are ≥5 cm, the procedure may need to be performed under general anesthesia to ensure patient comfort and achieve adequate exposure.</p><p>An incision in the anterior-posterior axis of the vulva is preferred (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78394" href="/d/graphic/78394.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). This optimizes exposure, since the anterior-posterior axis of the vulva is larger than the medial-lateral axis. In addition, during the healing process, there will be less tension on the incision, due to the normal forces during movement in the vulvar area.</p><p>The incision should extend the length of the indurated vulvar tissue. A generous incision is required to allow complete drainage and irrigation of the abscess. A small incision may be inadequate and result in a wound that is more difficult to pack postoperatively.</p><p>Abscess fluid and debrided material should be sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture and susceptibility testing. The base of the abscess should be debrided until all necrotic tissue has been removed. Consultation with an advanced pelvic surgeon may be required if the abscess extends into the mons pubis and/or into the medial aspect of the thigh or if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected.</p><p>As with incision and drainage at other body sites, the defect should be drained, irrigated, and packed with gauze (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78394" href="/d/graphic/78394.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). This saline-soaked gauze is removed and replaced daily ("wet to dry").</p><p>There are several options for wound management after an incision and drainage of a vulvar abscess. One option is wet to dry dressing changes, having the wound heal by secondary intention, from the base upward until the defect has healed and closed. The cavity becomes smaller and smaller with time, requiring less packing material. The patient and/or family must be comfortable with changing the wet to dry dressings, or home health care must be arranged. Another option is to place sutures in the operating room, but not tie them. Initially, wet to dry dressing changes are done for approximately three to seven days. Then the sutures are tied together, to approximate the edges of the cavity for healing [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Wound management should be individualized based on the size and depth of the incision and drainage cavity, to prevent re-infection and assure proper healing. We have even used wound vacuums in some patients. These work well, and potentially offer more rapid wound healing, although they are often more costly than some other options. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2881.html" rel="external">"Negative pressure wound therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h3">Antibiotic therapy after drainage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of antibiotic therapy following incision and drainage of vulvar abscesses is uncertain. No high quality data address this question. The microbiology of skin abscesses at other body sites differs from vulvar abscesses, so it is not known whether data from other sites can be extrapolated to treatment of vulvar lesions.</p><p>The most relevant study regarding this question was a randomized trial of patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses (including groin and buttock abscesses) treated in an emergency department in which incision and drainage was performed in combination with seven days of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9785" href="/d/drug information/9785.html" rel="external">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (oral, 160 mg/800 mg twice daily) or placebo [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].
