         The anatomy of the knee with an emphasis on biomechanics is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88813.html" rel="external">
          "Physical examination of the knee", section on 'Anatomy'

        </p>
        <p>
         The growth plate or physis represents a major anatomical difference between adult and pediatric bone. Growing long bones in children and younger adolescents are composed of the following segments: diaphysis (shaft), metaphysis (where the bone flares), physis (growth plate), and epiphysis (secondary ossification center)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444" href="/z/d/graphic/79444.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Growth plates mark a weak point in pediatric bone and are susceptible to fracture. Because the tensile strength of pediatric bone is less than that of the ligaments, the same injury mechanism that causes a ligamentous injury in adults (ligamentous sprain, strain, or tear) is more likely to cause a bone injury in children: The physis will separate from the epiphysis, creating a physeal fracture before disruption or "spraining" of an adjacent strong and flexible ligament. After closure of the physis, the tensile strength of bone exceeds that of the ligaments and ligamentous injury without bone injury occurs more commonly. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6536.html" rel="external">
          "General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children", section on 'Physeal (growth plate)'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, physeal closure around the knee occurs in late adolescence. However, the timing of physeal closure varies in individual patients and by bone and patient sex. The typical age of physeal closure of the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal fibula, and tibial tuberosity are provided in the figure  (

         For this topic, acute injury refers to sudden trauma (eg, a collision between players, a fall while riding a bicycle, or a motor vehicle collision). Of note, some chronic conditions may become apparent during evaluation for a traumatic injury, such as a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) or a septic arthritis. (See

         Acute pain is distinguished by duration. For most musculoskeletal conditions, pain for less than six weeks is usually described as acute or subacute, while pain lasting longer than six weeks is typically characterized as chronic. While the six-week threshold is arbitrary, it can be useful because many self-limited injuries heal by the end of six weeks with appropriate rest. Acute pain typically has no progressive pattern. In response to a particular trauma, acute pain flares, lasts a predictable period, and then subsides as healing occurs.

         Chronic knee pain in children and skeletally immature adolescents is discussed separately. (See

         Acute knee injuries occur frequently in children and skeletally immature adolescents. Based upon emergency department visits, the incidence in children and adolescents ranges from 3 to 12 knee injuries per 1000 persons [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Sports, recreation (eg, bicycle riding and trampoline use), and falls from stairs or furniture are the most frequent activities that result in injury [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, American football, basketball, and soccer account for the largest proportion of sports-related knee injuries [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Outside of the United States, soccer and basketball pose the greatest risk [

          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Among children 5 to 14 years of age, the most common knee injuries are cutaneous contusions, lacerations, ligamentous sprains or strains, fractures, or patellar dislocations [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Although fractures occur more frequently in children and skeletally immature adolescents than in skeletally mature adolescents and adults, ligamentous sprains or strains are still the most common injury in these patients, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are the most common condition [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. About 2 percent of knee injuries result in hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ] and up to 17 percent of knee injuries warrant surgical repair [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Multiple studies in high school athletes have found that adolescent girls have a significantly higher risk of a major knee injury from sports compared to boys [

         A hyperextension injury of the distal femur can result in the anterior displacement of the epiphysis. In this situation, the proximal fracture fragment can be driven posterior into the popliteal fossa where it can damage popliteal vessels and the common peroneal or posterior tibial nerves. Alternatively, when a valgus-type force is applied directly to the lateral side of the distal femur as with American football injuries, it generally results in a Salter-Harris type II or III fracture  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83180" href="/z/d/graphic/83180.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). These fractures frequently have an associated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear with knee instability. Less commonly, they may be open fractures. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13907.html" rel="external">
          "Distal femoral fractures in children", section on 'Mechanism of injury'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of a distal femur fracture will usually be suspected based upon the history of a high-energy mechanism with physical examination findings of pain and swelling around the distal femur and knee  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83181" href="/z/d/graphic/83181.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Patients with distal femur fractures will often be in severe pain and unable to bear weight. Associated hamstring muscle spasms will cause the knee to be flexed with resultant obvious knee deformity. A careful neurovascular examination is imperative. Due to the risk of vascular compromise associated with distal femoral fractures, the soft tissues around the knee must also be examined for compartment syndrome at the initial presentation and subsequently. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">
          "Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities", section on 'Clinical features'

        </p>
        <p>
         Initial evaluation of a suspected distal femur fracture should include standard anterior posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the knee and entire femur, including the hip, to determine fracture line, degree of displacement and to rule-out an associated knee dislocation. The management of distal femoral physeal fractures is discussed separately. (See

         Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocations are much less common than physeal fractures in skeletally immature children and adolescents. Suspected dislocations warrant emergency imaging with plain radiographs and reduction followed by careful neurovascular assessment, including arterial imaging (eg, Doppler flow study, Computed tomographic angiogram, or arteriography of the popliteal artery). If emergency imaging is not available, then reduction should be attempted and transfer to a facility with vascular surgery, vascular radiology, and orthopedic surgery expertise should be performed. (See

         Knee dislocations are most common after high-velocity trauma (eg, motor vehicle accident or fall from height) but can occur with low-velocity trauma in contact sports. Mechanisms of injury include hyperextension, valgus rotary stress, and varus rotary stress. Knee dislocations result from the rupture of at least two, but usually three, of the four major ligaments, resulting in multidirectional instability. The ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) usually are involved, although this is not always the case. Most knee dislocations are anterior or posterior, with the direction of dislocation indicating the movement of the tibia relative to the femur. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/261.html" rel="external">
          "Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction", section on 'Clinical presentation and mechanism of injury'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Knee dislocations usually are obvious when there is gross deformity of the knee. Although in children and adolescents with an obvious deformity, displaced fractures may look like a knee dislocation. Knee dislocations that have reduced spontaneously may be more subtle. Thus, whenever it is clear from the initial evaluation that two ligaments have ruptured (the ACL/medial collateral ligament [MCL] combination is most common), the possibility of a spontaneously reduced knee dislocation must be considered and the neurovascular status of the lower extremity carefully monitored. It is important to inquire about the mechanism and the position of the leg immediately following the injury, and whether it changed subsequently. Complications of knee dislocation include popliteal artery and peroneal nerve injury, which occur primarily after anterior-posterior and lateral dislocations, respectively  (

         ). In one observational study of 2267 children 19 years of age or younger with tibiofemoral (knee) dislocations, vascular injury occurred in 2.4 percent of patients [

          Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
         </strong>
         – ACL tears are the most common ligamentous knee injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents. They are typically sustained through a non-contact injury but may also occur with a direct blow to the knee that results in hyperextension or valgus deformation. These tears are suspected on the basis of a suggestive history (sudden change of direction or landing during sport causing the knee to "pop" or give out) and clinical findings (acute knee effusion with positive Lachman  (

          Medial collateral ligament (MCL)

          Patellar sleeve fractures

         Diagnosis of a patellar sleeve fracture is based upon clinical findings and imaging. Radiographic findings include a high-riding patella or a distal fracture fragment. However, an unremarkable plain radiograph does not rule out a fracture because bone fragments can be difficult to see. Other imaging (eg, ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], or MRI) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis when clinical suspicion is high. The management of avulsion fractures is similar to that for quadriceps or patellar tendon injuries; surgery is typically required. (See

         Patellar dislocation typically occurs when the lower leg is externally rotated and the quadriceps muscle forcefully contract to extend the knee. Patellar dislocation also can follow collision with another person, particularly if the knee sustains valgus (inward) force (eg, football injuries). Patients with first-time dislocations often report hearing a loud sound and feeling a sensation of tearing and dislocation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6309.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         An unreduced acute dislocation usually demonstrates obvious lateral patellar displacement on inspection of the knee  (

          picture 7
         </a>
         ). Displacement in any other direction is rare in children and skeletally immature adolescents. In a patient with normal elasticity who dislocates the patella for the first time, lateral dislocation tears the medial patellar stabilizers, including the medial retinaculum, which causes a rapidly enlarging medial hematoma. By contrast, patients who have chronic subluxation of the patella, or in whom the patellofemoral joint is hypermobile, the bleeding and swelling after an episode may be minimal. Acute patellar dislocation can be complicated by bone and chondral fracture. Treatment consists of reduction of the lateral dislocation  (

         Injuries to the muscles (eg, tears and strains) surrounding the knee may present acutely, or as an acute exacerbation of a chronic problem. Acute injuries typically involve sudden, forceful eccentric contraction of the involved muscle. The muscle groups most commonly injured include the hamstring, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius. The symptoms of muscle injury include local pain which can be severe and limit range of motion. Significant swelling, tenderness to palpation, and ecchymosis may be present. The diagnosis of a muscle strain or tear is based upon clinical findings. Diagnostic imaging (eg, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging) is only employed if there is diagnostic uncertainty.

         Meniscal injuries are caused when the patient twists the leg while bearing weight (eg, when landing from a jump). Meniscal injuries are sometimes described as "torn cartilage" or a "locked knee." The mechanisms for meniscal injuries are similar to those of ACL injuries, and these injuries often occur together in children and skeletally immature adolescents [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Weightbearing is usually limited by pain, and swelling typically develops within 24 hours. Mechanical symptoms may be more common than pain because only the periphery of the menisci contains nerve fibers. Mechanical symptoms include locking, popping, and catching. Other symptoms include swelling, pain with rotation or flexion (particularly at the extremes of those motions), pain along the joint line, weakness or giving way, and a generalized aching. (See

         A working diagnosis is based upon clinical findings. The positive predictive value of the clinical examination for medial and lateral meniscal injuries in children and adolescents is 15 and 34 percent, respectively, compared with arthroscopic examination; the negative predictive value for each is over 95 percent [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>

          "Meniscal injury of the knee", section on 'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         ). Thus, after clinical examination, if the experienced clinician thinks there is no meniscal tear, they are justified in not getting an MRI; if they think one is present, then an MRI is a reasonable next step, although both clinical examination and MRI have a low positive predictive value compared with arthroscopy [

         Quadriceps and patellar tendon injuries occur uncommonly in children and skeletally immature adolescents. Patients with these injuries may have a secondary cause of tendon weakness such as anabolic steroid abuse, renal disease, metabolic bone disease, or medications associated with tendon rupture (eg, quinolone antibiotics). Tendon tears and complete rupture occur following a sudden, strong contraction of the quadriceps muscles, as happens when landing from a high jump or making a sudden change in direction at high speed. The movement is followed immediately by sharp pain at the knee. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         With complete tendon tears, the patient may experience a sudden "pop" or tearing sensation at the patella, followed immediately by swelling and difficulty bearing weight. An acute hemarthrosis may develop. Focal tenderness along the anterior knee is present just above the patella or at the superior border for quadriceps ruptures and at the distal pole or anywhere along the course of the patellar tendon for a patellar tendon tear. Typically, knee extension is limited with partial tears and absent with complete tears. Patellar fractures frequently accompany tendon tears. (See

         Patients with popliteus tendinitis have pain that is localized to the posterior lateral knee. The pain is of relatively acute onset; it may occur during prolonged descents during hiking or running, and is exacerbated by excessive forefoot pronation. This is because the popliteus muscle is a secondary restraint to anterior femoral translation in descent, and may be required to be more active as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and iliotibial band (ITB) muscles are exhausted with prolonged exercise. Chronic popliteus tendinitis may be confused with iliotibial band syndrome. (See

         Acute knee pain can be referred pain from primary pathology in the hip, such as septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Typically, the pain is anterior, dull, nonradiating, and does not localize to bone or soft tissues of the knee. In such patients, the knee examination is usually normal and the hip examination demonstrates a limited range of motion and/or pain. Patients with septic arthritis have significant pain on any movement of the hip. The clinician should urgently involve an orthopedic surgeon for joint drainage in patients with a septic hip. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Adolescents with SCFE can present with knee or thigh pain. Range of motion of the hips, particularly internal rotation, is often limited. Urgent referral is necessary because a delay in diagnosis can lead to worsening of the condition and an increased risk of complications (eg, osteonecrosis of the femoral head or narrowing of the joint space) which can be crippling.

         In some pediatric patients, serious systemic illness may present with a history of incidental trauma. Fever, local findings of inflammation, rash, a history of chronic knee pain, or a past medical history that identifies an underlying bleeding disorder can help identify these patients. Systemic disease that may cause unilateral knee pain and/or swelling includes septic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteomyelitis, Lyme disease (endemic areas), hemoglobinopathy, bleeding disorder, benign bone tumors, or malignancy (eg, leukemia, osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma)  (

         The acute evaluation of young child and adolescent athletes with acute knee injury requires identification and rapid management of limb-threatening injuries with gross deformity or neurovascular compromise  (

         In patients without limb-threatening injuries, a careful history and physical examination can establish a working diagnosis.

         Many but not all of these injuries can be identified upon gross inspection and a careful physical examination with close attention to the neurovascular status. Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocations should undergo emergency plain radiography followed by immediate reduction by a knowledgeable clinician. Patients with displaced fractures should have the knee immobilized or splinted in a position of comfort without worsening neurovascular status as soon as possible, and, undergo emergency management based upon the specific condition.

          table 3

        <p>
         It is also important to consider causes of knee pain that are unrelated to sports activity. In some pediatric patients, serious systemic illness may present with a history of incidental trauma. Past medical history, family history, and review of systems should focus on symptoms or signs of other causes of unilateral knee pain and/or swelling (eg, septic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteomyelitis, Lyme disease [endemic areas], hemoglobinopathy, bleeding disorder, malignancy [eg, leukemia, osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma], slipped capital femoral epiphysis [SCFE], or Legg-Calve-Perthes disease)  (

         The physical examination of any joint is classically divided into inspection, palpation, range of motion, strength and neurovascular testing. For the lower extremities and only if fracture and/or joint instability are excluded, gait should also be evaluated. Special tests are selected based upon the most likely diagnostic category, which is based in turn upon the history, including the mechanism of any injury and physical findings. Guidance about which examination techniques are most useful for diagnosing specific knee injuries in children and skeletally immature athletes is provided in the text above and a topic devoted to the knee examination.

         Because of the greater likelihood of fractures in children and young adolescents, the clinician should first evaluate for the need for plain radiographs suggested by a gross deformity, neurovascular deficit, large knee effusion, bony tenderness, penetrating injury into the joint, or signs of referred pain from the hip. If indicated, radiographs should be obtained prior to performing provocative maneuvers or having the patient bear weight or walk  (

         The bounce home test is another test of knee extension. It is performed with the patient supine. The knee is passively flexed to approximately 15 degrees and then permitted to fall into extension with gravity  (

         ). The test is positive if the knee does not fully extend (known as "true locking"). True locking can be caused by a displaced torn meniscal flap, a loose intraarticular body, articular surface damage, or a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

          Ligaments
         </strong>
         – Tenderness and/or laxity suggests a ligamentous injury (sprain), the severity of which is graded by the degree of laxity for the specific ligament. The grades of sprains are easiest to determine in the immediate post-injury period before the onset of swelling and secondary muscle spasm. (See

          Meniscus

          Muscles
         </strong>
         – The muscles about the knee should be inspected for swelling and ecchymosis and palpated for signs of tenderness. The integrity of the quadriceps mechanism and quadriceps strength are assessed by asking the patient to extend the leg against resistance placed at the lower leg  (

          Gait
         </strong>
         – The gait of patients in whom the initial evaluation does not suggest fracture or dislocation should be observed to see if they are able to bear weight. Movement of the knee is painful and guarded in patients with internal derangement (ie, fracture, chondral lesion, injury to the cruciate or collateral ligaments, and/or menisci). Patients with these injuries usually have little spontaneous knee movement and are unable to bear weight, particularly if more than one structure is involved (eg, the medial meniscus and ACL).

         In addition, although derived in adults, the Ottawa knee rules have undergone validation in a multicenter trial of 750 children aged 2 to 16 years who presented to the emergency department with a knee injury and had 100 percent sensitivity (95% CI 95-100 percent) for identifying fractures although 89 percent of patients underwent plain radiography. [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. In a subsequent meta-analysis that included this study and two other prospective, observational studies (1130 children, most &gt;5 years of age), the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 99 and 46 percent, respectively, with a pooled negative predictive value of 99.8 percent (fracture prevalence 8.7 percent) [

Based on these findings, application of the Ottawa knee rules in children older than five years of age could result in an estimated reduction in radiography as high as 40 percent, depending upon local practice. However, large validation and implementation studies of the Ottawa knee rules in children are lacking.

         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best technique for the diagnosis of soft tissue injuries including, tears of the ligaments, menisci, tendons, and muscles [

          19,20,25
         </a>
         ]. It can also identify evidence of patellar dislocation in patients with spontaneous reduction. MRI is not necessary in all children and skeletally immature adolescents with acute internal derangement but should be used if the diagnosis is in question, if they do not improve with conservative treatment, or if the plan is to undergo diagnostic arthroscopy only if the MRI is abnormal [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>

False-positive results are rare, and with the exception of posterior meniscus injuries, false-negative results are also rare. Arthroscopy is used selectively, as an adjunct to the history, physical examination, and MRI when there is a diagnostic dilemma. The only absolute indication for arthroscopy is mechanical disruption of normal knee function.

         The acute evaluation of children and skeletally immature adolescents with acute knee injury requires rapid identification and management of limb-threatening injuries identified by gross deformity, neurovascular compromise, or penetrating injury into the knee joint  (

         Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocations should undergo immediate reduction by a knowledgeable clinician. Patients with displaced fractures should have the knee immobilized or splinted in a position of comfort and without worsening neurovascular status pending definitive treatment. Patients with neurovascular compromise warrant specialized imaging as determined by orthopedic and vascular surgery consultants. (See

         After evaluation and management of any limb-threatening injury, a careful history and physical examination can provide a working diagnosis. The differential diagnosis can often be narrowed based upon the mechanism of injury  (

         Patients should also undergo careful evaluation of range of motion and palpation of the hip and ankle. Those patients with abnormal findings should undergo hip and/or ankle radiographs in addition to knee radiographs. Hip pathology can frequently cause pain that is referred to the knee. (See

         In patients in whom fractures are not present on plain radiographs but who have a knee effusion, the location of pain, along with key historical features and a careful physical examination can often identify the most likely cause  (

         Patients with isolated cutaneous or muscle injury do not usually have a knee effusion. Pain is localized to the wound, cutaneous bruise, or affected muscle. (See

         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best technique for the diagnosis of soft tissue injuries including, tears of the ligaments, menisci, tendons, and muscles. It can also identify evidence of patellar dislocation in patients with spontaneous reduction. MRI is not necessary in all children and skeletally immature adolescents with clinical findings of these injuries but should be used if the diagnosis is in question. Clinicians who are unskilled in the knee examination should consult with a sports medicine physician or orthopedic surgeon with training in sports medicine before obtaining an MRI. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Magnetic resonance imaging'
