Overweight refers to a weight above the "normal" range, with normal defined on the basis of actuarial data. This is determined by calculating the body mass index (BMI, defined as the weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; obesity is defined as a BMI of ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Severe obesity is defined as a BMI ≥40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (or ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the presence of comorbidities) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). Although these categorical definitions are clinically useful, it is clear that the risks imparted by increasing body mass follow a continuum and vary considerably between individuals.</p><p>An overview of the management of obesity is provided here. Information on screening, evaluation, health hazards associated with obesity, and specific therapies are reviewed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5370.html" rel="external">"Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5375.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5379.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5382.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5376.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Drug therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88536.html" rel="external">"Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/586.html" rel="external">"Bariatric surgery for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90469.html" rel="external">"Outcomes of bariatric surgery"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106357.html" rel="external">"Intragastric balloon therapy for weight loss"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">IMPORTANCE OF WEIGHT LOSS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The medical rationale for weight loss in people with obesity is that obesity is a disease associated with a significant increase in mortality  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73156" href="/d/graphic/73156.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and many health risks, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease. The higher the body mass index (BMI), the greater the risk of morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The relationship between BMI and mortality is likely to be similar for all races and ethnicities, but the minimal BMI where excess risk is seen may differ. These risks are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5370.html" rel="external">"Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H342829129"><span class="h2">Morbidity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Life insurance reports, the first to suggest that lower body weight was associated with lower morbidity and mortality, have been corroborated by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) among other studies [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Furthermore, randomized trials inducing weight loss via lifestyle, pharmacologic therapy, or bariatric surgical procedures have been shown to reduce a wide array of weight-related morbidity [<a href="#rid1">1,3-5</a>].</p><p>As an example, in the frequently cited Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), intensive lifestyle modification focusing on weight loss reduced the rate of progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes over three years [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The efficacy of the intensive lifestyle modification persisted over 15 years but was somewhat attenuated over time. There was also a persistent reduction in risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>], although no reduction was observed for all-cause, cancer-related, or cardiovascular mortality at 21 years of follow-up [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In similar trials evaluating intensive clinician-supervised weight loss, remission of type 2 diabetes was reported in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>Other trials have also reported a beneficial effect of weight loss on additional CVD risk factors, including blood pressure [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>] and plasma lipid levels [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], as well as a reduction in cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], although the latter was only seen after bariatric surgery. Additional benefits of weight loss include improvements in urinary incontinence, sleep apnea, depression, quality of life, physical functioning, and mobility. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1529.html" rel="external">"Obesity: Association with cardiovascular disease", section on 'Benefits of weight loss'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3875.html" rel="external">"Overweight, obesity, and weight reduction in hypertension", section on 'Long-term effects of weight reduction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5370.html" rel="external">"Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences", section on 'Morbidity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H779611484"><span class="h2">Mortality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials suggest that weight loss (including nonsurgical and surgical weight loss approaches) in people with overweight and obesity is associated with a reduction in overall mortality [<a href="#rid13">13,16-20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90469.html" rel="external">"Outcomes of bariatric surgery"</a>.)</p><p>In the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial, 5145 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI &gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned to an intensive lifestyle intervention (group and individual meetings to achieve weight loss with diet and exercise) or standard diabetes education [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. After a median follow-up of 9.6 years, the composite primary outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for angina) occurred in a similar number of patients in the intervention and control groups [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Possible reasons for this finding include the lower-than-expected rates of cardiovascular events in both groups, improved overall cardiovascular risk factor treatment with medical therapy (eg, antihypertensives, statins), enrollment of a relatively healthy patient population, and gradual weight loss in the control group such that the differential weight loss between the two groups was only 2.5 percent at study end [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. However, among those trial participants who lost &gt;10 percent of their weight over the first year, there was a 20 percent risk reduction in the primary composite outcome [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Furthermore, the intervention group achieved its results with less use of CVD risk-lowering medications than the control group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to management outlined below is based upon available clinical trial evidence (reviewed in the individual topics), clinical expertise, and patient preference, and is largely in agreement with published guidelines [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H447678688"><span class="h2">Goals of treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of therapy is to prevent, treat, or reverse the complications of obesity and improve quality of life [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. Health benefits have been reported with weight loss of as little as 5 percent of body weight [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Many patients, however, have a weight loss goal of 30 percent or more below their current weight, a goal that is often not achievable without bariatric surgery. With lifestyle measures alone, a weight loss of 5 to 7 percent of body weight is more typical but often difficult to maintain. In trials comparing pharmacologic therapy with placebo, weight loss of 5 to 10 percent using both drug and behavioral intervention is considered a very good response, and weight loss exceeding 10 percent is considered an excellent response. Hence, it is helpful to understand the expected magnitude of weight loss with any given intervention in order to align it with the patient's goal. Of note, in a randomized trial, treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115980" href="/d/drug information/115980.html" rel="external">semaglutide</a> resulted in an 14.9 percent average weight loss, with roughly one-third of patients achieving ≥ 20 percent weight loss at one year [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. These results suggest that developments in pharmacotherapies may ultimately yield weight loss results approaching those seen in bariatric surgery.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Identify candidates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Assessment of an individual's overall risk status includes determination of the degree of overweight (body mass index [BMI]), the presence of abdominal obesity (waist circumference), and the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) or other comorbidities (eg, sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). The relationship between BMI and risk for weight-related health complications allows identification of patients appropriate for weight loss intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation", section on 'Assessing obesity-related health risk'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Little or no risk</strong> – A BMI of 20 to 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is associated with little or no increased risk unless waist circumference is high (a marker of increased cardiometabolic risk) or the person has gained more than 10 kg since age 18 years. Asian individuals start to incur risk, even in this low range (ie, BMI &gt;23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation", section on 'BMI-based classifications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low risk</strong> – Individuals with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, who do not have risk factors for CVD or other weight-related comorbidities, may be described as having low risk, particularly if they are older. They should receive counseling on prevention of weight gain, including advice on dietary habits and physical activity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5382.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate risk</strong> – Individuals with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and with one or more risk factors for CVD (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia), or with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, are at moderate risk. Such patients should be offered or referred to intensive, multicomponent behavioral intervention [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. This includes tools and strategies to make dietary changes, increase physical activity, and support and maintain weight loss. Pharmacologic therapy should also be considered.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High risk</strong> – Individuals with a BMI of 35 to 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> are at high risk, especially those ages 20 to 39 [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], as well as those with a BMI above 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Individuals in the highest-risk categories should receive the most aggressive treatment (intensive, multicomponent behavioral intervention, pharmacologic therapy, bariatric surgery). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5382.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5376.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Drug therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/586.html" rel="external">"Bariatric surgery for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>BMI is calculated as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1">BMI = Body weight (in kg) ÷ height squared, in meters (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>)</p><p></p><p>BMI is correlated with body fat. Overweight and obesity are defined as a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. As noted, an elevated BMI is a necessary basis for treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation", section on 'Body mass index'</a>.)</p><p>Waist circumference is measured with a metal or plastic, nondistensible tape measure, placed around the abdomen parallel to the floor at the level of the iliac crest with the patient standing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77584" href="/d/graphic/77584.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). A waist circumference of ≥40 inches (102 cm) for men and ≥35 inches (88 cm) for women is considered elevated and indicative of increased cardiometabolic risk [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the BMI range of 25 to 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, an increased waist circumference may indicate need for more aggressive treatment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation", section on 'Waist circumference'</a>.)</p><p>However, there is ethnic variability in waist circumference values that predict increased risk. As an example, Japanese Americans and Indians from South Asia have more total fat and visceral fat and therefore may be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes for a given BMI than White persons. In Asian females, waist circumference &gt;80 cm (31.5 inches) and in Asian males a value &gt;90 cm (35.4 inches) are considered abnormal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation", section on 'Waist circumference'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Initial treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial management of individuals who would benefit from weight loss is a comprehensive lifestyle intervention: a combination of diet, exercise, and behavioral modification. All patients who would benefit from weight loss should receive counseling on diet, exercise, and goals for weight loss. The behavioral modification component facilitates adherence to diet and exercise regimens, and includes regular self-monitoring of food intake, physical activity, and weight. The role of behavioral therapy, diet, and exercise in the treatment of obesity are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5382.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5375.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy", section on 'Goals of weight loss'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5379.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H985126051"><span class="h3">Comprehensive lifestyle intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One example of a successful comprehensive lifestyle intervention program is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], subsequently used in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The two major goals of the DPP lifestyle intervention were a minimum of 7 percent weight loss through a low-fat, hypocaloric diet and a minimum of 150 minutes of exercise per week (such as brisk walking). Several behavioral components were used to help achieve these goals, including behavioral self-management training, individual case managers, group and/or individual sessions, individualized adherence strategies, and a network of training, feedback, and clinical support [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Using this approach, lifestyle intervention was more effective for preventing diabetes than a pharmacologic intervention (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9621" href="/d/drug information/9621.html" rel="external">metformin</a>); 58 versus 31 percent risk reduction at 3.1 years [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1774.html" rel="external">"Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5379.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5375.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy"</a>.)</p><p>Although a number of commercially available weight loss programs boast &gt;10 percent weight loss, a meta-analysis of 22 behavioral weight loss studies showed just over 4 percent average loss compared with 1 percent for the control groups, with maximal effect within the first six months after the initiation of treatment [<a href="#rid6">6,30,31</a>]. Regrettably, as with other therapies for obesity, maintenance of these initial weight losses has been difficult [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h3">Dietary therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many types of diets produce modest weight loss. Options include balanced low-calorie, low-fat/low-calorie, moderate-fat/low-calorie, or low-carbohydrate diets, as well as the Mediterranean diet. Diets can be consumed conventionally or on a time-restricted basis (ie, intermittent fasting). Dietary adherence is an important predictor of weight loss, regardless of the type of diet chosen [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Thus, we advise tailoring a diet that reduces energy intake below energy expenditure to individual patient preferences, rather than focusing on the macronutrient composition of the diet. The addition of dietary counseling may facilitate weight loss, particularly during the first year. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5375.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy", section on 'Types of diets'</a>.)</p><p>Metabolic studies using state-of-the-art techniques have concluded that most adults will lose weight when fed &lt;1000 kcal/day. Thus, even subjects who are concerned that they are "metabolically resistant" to weight loss will lose weight if they comply with a diet of 800 to 1200 kcal/day. More severe caloric restriction might be expected to induce weight loss more quickly, but a comparison with 400 versus 800 kcal/day diet formulas showed no difference in weight loss [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], presumably due to slowing of resting metabolic rate. We thus advise diets consisting of &gt;800 kcal/day. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5375.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy", section on 'Very low-calorie diets'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, because of the body’s hormonal adaptation to perceived starvation, it is difficult to maintain a very low-calorie diet long-term. However, these diets may be used in certain conditions when rapid weight loss is needed (eg, to obtain metabolic control in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertension, or in preparation for a surgical procedure such as joint replacement, bariatric surgery, or organ transplantation).</p><p>Other dietary patterns, such as intermittent fasting (eg, alternate-day fasting or time-restricted feeding) are sometimes used to promote weight loss, although the evidence of their efficacy is mixed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5375.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy", section on 'Intermittent fasting'</a>.)</p><p>No matter which diet or dietary pattern is chosen, continued surveillance by both clinician and patient are essential for treatment success.

In addition, physical activity can attenuate the loss of lean mass (eg, muscle) during active weight loss [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Physical activity should be performed for approximately 30 minutes or more, five to seven days a week, to prevent weight gain and to improve cardiovascular health [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. There appears to be a dose effect for physical activity and weight loss, and much greater amounts of exercise are necessary to produce significant weight loss in the absence of a calorically restricted diet. Therefore, when weight loss is the desired goal, a calorie-restricted diet should be combined with less sedentary time and increased physical activity; the activity should be gradually increased over time as tolerated. A multicomponent program that includes aerobic and resistance training is preferred. Existing medical conditions, age, and preferences for types of exercise should all be considered in the decisions.
