         database. In developed areas, prostate cancer is increasingly being diagnosed when the tumor is confined to the prostate, due at least in part to screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, prostate cancers confined to the gland may become less frequent than more invasive tumors as PSA screening rates fall [

         The initial management of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer needs to incorporate a consideration of the prolonged natural history of the disease and the risk for progression to disseminated, potentially fatal disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial evaluation should include clinical staging based on a digital rectal examination by an experienced clinician to assess the extent of disease, the pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the Gleason score/grade group in the initial biopsy, and the number and extent of cancer involvement in the biopsy cores. This allows the stratification of males into risk categories according to the primary tumor. There is ongoing debate as to the optimal risk stratification system to be used in the selection of treatment for prostate cancer. We use the risk categories as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), which have been used in guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the NCCN [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. However, others disagree.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, the European Society for Medical Oncology uses a three-tiered system for risk stratification of localized prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, this may also be supplemented by the molecular characteristics (genomic profile) of the tumor. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Germline testing'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Tissue-based molecular assays'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Imaging studies (radionuclide bone scan, computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used selectively to assess for extraprostatic extension, regional adenopathy, or distant metastases, depending on the initial clinical staging and estimate of risk; imaging for distant metastases is not routinely recommended for very low- and low-risk disease according to the clinical staging system described above, while it is recommended for more advanced disease. Bone imaging and pelvic imaging, with or without abdominal imaging, are recommended for those with intermediate- and high-risk disease [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. MRI of the prostate is often obtained in males with low- and very low-risk disease to ensure that high-grade disease has not been overlooked. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16992.html" rel="external">
          "Initial staging and evaluation of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         On the basis of imaging, patients can be further classified as having regional (regional nodes) or metastatic (distant sites or nonregional lymph nodes) disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         This initial evaluation (stage, biopsy Gleason score/grade group, serum PSA, imaging, and genomic profile) provides information for clinical staging, as distinct from pathologic staging  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80052" href="/z/d/graphic/80052.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), and forms the basis for the initial treatment decisions. The initial evaluation may significantly under or overestimate the extent and/or aggressiveness of disease. Factors that need to be considered when relying upon clinical staging include variability in the interpretation of findings on digital rectal examination, variability in assigning Gleason grade on the biopsy, and sampling errors in the prostate biopsy that may lead to missing areas with Gleason 4 or 5 disease. Use of multiparametric MRI may improve targeting of prostate lesions for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy and thus decrease the risk of missing areas with Gleason 4 or 5 disease [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, this technique is subject to variability in the interpretation of imaging and the experience of the clinician performing the biopsy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97482.html" rel="external">
          "The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer", section on 'Methods for MRI-targeted prostate biopsy'

         The standard staging system for newly diagnosed prostate cancer is that of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>

         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         This system incorporates the anatomic extent of disease based upon the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). The staging system also incorporates the pretreatment serum PSA and histologic grade group, based upon the Gleason score, to divide patients into prognostic categories. This information about prognostic categories is combined with patient age, life expectancy, overall medical condition (including performance status and comorbidities), presence or absence of symptoms, and patient preferences to make decisions for the optimal treatment for an individual patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gleason grades for the two most prevalent differentiation patterns are combined to create the Gleason score, and Gleason score is now incorporated into the newly adopted grade group system [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In the grade group system, tumors are separated into five categories based upon the primary and secondary Gleason pattern (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">

         An estimate of tumor volume in the prostate needle biopsy can provide additional useful information [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-14
         </a>
         ]. The percentage of positive cores is now incorporated into the division of intermediate-risk prostate cancer into favorable and unfavorable subsets in the NCCN system [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The best method to assess the volume of cancer in the prostate biopsy is unknown [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ], but this parameter can be quantified using the maximal percentage of a core involved with cancer, the percentage of cores that are positive, or the pathologist's estimate of the percentage of biopsy tissue containing cancer overall. The generic term "percentage of positive biopsies" is often applied to any of these quantitative measures. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">
          "Interpretation of prostate biopsy", section on 'Estimated tumor volume'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The influence of prostate biopsy tumor volume on outcome was illustrated by a report of 960 surgically treated males in which 80 percent of those in the intermediate-risk group (clinical stage T2b, biopsy Gleason grade 7 [grade group 2 or 3], or preoperative serum PSA between 10 and 20 ng/mL) could be classified into two separate risk groups based upon the fraction of prostate biopsies that were found to contain cancer [

        </p>
        <p>
         Similar refinement in prognostication was demonstrated for patients in the high-risk group. By contrast, the percentage of positive biopsies provided no additional prognostic value in patients at low risk for recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another report showed that males at low risk of recurrence with &gt;50 percent positive biopsies were significantly more likely to be pathologically upgraded at surgery from Gleason ≤6 to Gleason 7 tumors than those with &lt;50 percent positive samples (59 versus 26 percent) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. These higher rates of pathologic upgrading translated into significantly lower five-year PSA failure-free survival rates (62 versus 92 percent).

         Prognostic tests based on molecular and biomarker analysis of tumor tissue may improve risk stratification of both untreated and treated males with localized prostate cancer. Several of these tests (Oncotype DX, Prolaris, ConfirmMDx, Decipher) have been validated and are clinically available. We agree with guidelines from the NCCN [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ], which support the use of molecular biomarkers in localized low-risk and favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer when results are likely to influence treatment decisions (eg, males who are considering active surveillance, or selected males with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease when deciding whether to add androgen deprivation therapy to radiation therapy [RT]).
        </p>
        <p>
         An increased understanding of prostate cancer biology has led to the development of tissue-based molecular assays that are specifically tailored to prostate cancer in an effort to improve decision making in newly diagnosed males considering active surveillance and in treated males considering adjuvant therapy or treatment of recurrence  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126666" href="/z/d/graphic/126666.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). Uncertainty about the risk of disease progression could be reduced if such molecular assays provided accurate and reproducible prognostic or predictive information beyond NCCN risk group assignment and currently available life expectancy tables and nomograms. Retrospective studies have shown that these assays provide prognostic information that is independent of NCCN risk stratification group [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         However, no randomized controlled trials have studied the utility of these tests, and there is disagreement about whether and how these tests should be used in selecting a treatment approach for low-risk prostate cancer.

         For patients who undergo radical prostatectomy, additional information about the extent of disease is obtained from the surgical specimen, and this forms the basis for pathologic staging  (

         Treatment decisions for localized prostate cancer are complicated and preference sensitive because of the differences in the specific risks and benefits of the various treatment choices. Patient-clinician shared decision making can facilitate selecting a treatment that best aligns with the patient's personal values, and it is recommended in professional society guidelines [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4,6
         </a>
         ]. The best way to facilitate this is unclear. In one randomized trial, a web-based intervention for assessing patient preferences, called Patient Preferences for Prostate Cancer Care (PreProCare), was associated with improved satisfaction with care and decisions about treatment for localized prostate cancer, reduced patient regret about the decision, and better alignment of the treatment choice with cancer risk categories [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. However, additional studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that formally assess preference, as well as other tools that attempt to reduce decisional conflict [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ], in different settings before it can be concluded that tools such as these improve patient-centered decision making and outcomes. An important issue is the disparity between patient expectations and actual treatment outcomes, both in terms of efficacy and toxicity (ie, functional outcomes) [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, one of the most important aspects of the decision-making process includes a discussion about the main side effects with each of the main forms of treatment and their time course. The important advantages, disadvantages, and contraindications associated with each approach are summarized in the tables  (

         For more than six decades, the AJCC has grouped cancer patients by stage of disease (I to IV), which is used to estimate prognosis. For prostate cancer, in addition to the usual local tumor (T stage) extent, anatomic patterns of spread to lymph nodes (N stage), and distant sites (M stage), non-anatomic factors such as grade group and PSA level were incorporated over time into the AJCC prognostic stage groups based on data supporting their significance  (

         ]. At the time, no model for localized prostate cancer was felt to be sufficiently accurate. However, in 2020, the STAR CAP model proposed a new contemporary pretreatment predictive staging system that meets these criteria [
         <a href="#rid37">

         ]. It was developed based upon multivariate analysis of data from over 19,000 males treated for localized prostate cancer with surgery or RT and validated in a dataset of over 125,000 males reported to the SEER database. A point system was assigned for the variables of age, T and N category, Gleason grade, percent positive prostate biopsy cores, and pretreatment PSA levels; and depending on the cumulative point total, a stage from IA to IIIC was assigned, with five-year prostate cancer-specific mortality ranging from 0.1 to 12.4 percent based on stage, and 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality ranging from 0.3 to 40 percent. The model was shown to have better discriminatory value for prostate cancer-specific mortality than either the AJCC 8

         An important point is that all current stratification systems to estimate risk of progression were based on data from patients who did not undergo MRI or targeted (MRI/US) prostate biopsy. As this is becoming more of a standard of care internationally, it is believed that the accuracy of estimating disease risk according to pretreatment assessment will improve over time.

         The choice of treatment for an individual patient with a non-high-grade localized prostatic adenocarcinoma depends on an informed patient decision incorporating knowledge about the potential advantages and disadvantages associated with each approach, along with personal preferences. The basic choices are external beam radiation therapy (RT) with or without brachytherapy, brachytherapy alone, radical prostatectomy, or active surveillance. The important advantages, disadvantages, and contraindications associated with each approach are summarized in the tables  (

         Patients with very low-risk prostate cancer have disease detected by prostate biopsy based upon serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) only, without a detectable abnormality on digital rectal examination or imaging. To be classified as very low risk, such patients must have a tumor that is in histologic grade group 1 (Gleason score ≤6) on biopsy and a serum PSA &lt;10 ng/mL. Furthermore, the extent of disease within the prostate must be limited (ie, fewer than three positive biopsy cores, with less than 50 percent involvement in any one core, and a PSA density less than 0.15 ng/mL/gram) [

         </a>
         ]. However, this approach is associated with a need for close follow-up and may create significant anxiety, causing many patients to subsequently choose definitive intervention even in the absence of progressive disease. We consider this to be an appropriate approach in the absence of certain histologic features (areas of cribriform or intraductal cancer) and low-risk gene expression profiles for males who meet the biologic criteria of low risk for metastasis and have psychological comfort with active surveillance. Some males may still choose to be treated (RT or radical prostatectomy) even in the presence of very low-risk disease. (See

         If chosen, radical prostatectomy may be carried out with either an open or minimally invasive approach. Lymph node dissection is optional for those with low-risk disease.

         ], the only data directly comparing these approaches in a large randomized trial come from the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial being conducted in the United Kingdom, in which patients were randomly assigned to active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, or definitive RT [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,44,45
         </a>
         ]. Most of the enrollees had very low- or low-risk disease (the median PSA was 4.6 ng/mL, 76 percent had a Gleason score of 6, and 76 percent had stage T1c disease). In this trial, there was no significant difference in the cancer-specific survival or overall survival rates between the different treatment modalities. However, there was an increased frequency of metastatic disease and clinical progression with active surveillance, and there were only a very limited number of deaths related to prostate cancer.

         Although the clinical presentation of these prostate cancers when they present with localized disease is similar to that of other prostate cancers, metastases often occur early in the natural history, and symptoms can be due to distant disease.

         Models such as these do not take into account genomic tests or molecular markers. As noted above, several tissue-based molecular assays have been developed in an effort to improve decision making in newly diagnosed males considering active surveillance. Uncertainty about the risk of disease progression could be reduced if such assays provided accurate and reproducible prognostic or predictive information beyond National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group assignment and currently available life expectancy tables and nomograms. Consensus-based guidelines from the NCCN indicate that males with low- or favorable intermediate-risk disease may consider the use of Decipher, Oncotype DX Prostate, Prolaris, or ProMark during initial risk stratification to select optimal candidates for active surveillance  (

         For purposes of selecting treatment, newly diagnosed prostate cancer is risk stratified based on digital rectal examination, serum PSA, prostate biopsy, and imaging studies. In some cases, assessment for germline alterations in homologous recombination DNA repair genes and tissue-based gene expression classifiers also contributes.

         – Active surveillance, is a preferred option for most males with very low-risk disease in the absence of certain histologic features (areas of cribriform or intraductal cancer) and for individuals who have psychologic comfort with active surveillance. Definitive local therapy (radiation therapy [RT], radical prostatectomy) may be offered to select patients who may have a high probability of progression on active surveillance, and to those who prefer definitive treatment even in the presence of very low-risk disease.
