Various strategies for HCT have been developed and are applied, dependent on the patient's disease and disease stage, the hematopoietic cell donor, and the source of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The assessment of those parameters, in turn, will affect the selection of the preparative regimen. These factors influence the efficacy of HCT and the short- and long-term toxicities associated with the procedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15803.html" rel="external">"Early complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122403.html" rel="external">"Survival, quality of life, and late complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Allogeneic HCT uses hematopoietic progenitor cells collected from a healthy person (not from the patients themselves). Allogeneic HCT is increasingly used to treat a variety of hematologic neoplasms and nonmalignant marrow disorders (acquired and inherited), including inborn errors of metabolism. Eligibility for allogeneic HCT varies across countries and institutions. Ultimately, decisions regarding transplant eligibility should be made on a case-by-case basis dependent on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient. Here we discuss eligibility for allogeneic HCT. Eligibility for autologous HCT, the use of HCT in specific disease settings, and short- and long-term complications of HCT are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16354.html" rel="external">"Determining eligibility for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3538.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic support after hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15803.html" rel="external">"Early complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122403.html" rel="external">"Survival, quality of life, and late complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14228.html" rel="external">"Long-term care of the adult hematopoietic cell transplantation survivor"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7277724"><span class="h1">IMPACT OF UNDERLYING DISEASE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7278017"><span class="h2">Disease-related indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, allogeneic HCT was offered to patients with hematologic malignancies who had exhausted other treatment modalities, and eligibility was largely based on whether the patient was in adequate physical condition to tolerate the anticipated toxicity. Currently, a decision to perform allogeneic HCT must include an assessment of the underlying disease state and whether allogeneic HCT is likely to offer results superior to those achieved with nontransplant options. The risks of morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic HCT must be compared with those of other treatment approaches.</p><p>The role of allogeneic HCT in specific diseases is discussed in more detail separately.

Additional information and instructions for referring a patient to an appropriate research center can be obtained from the United States National Institutes of Health (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2F&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o%2FoHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDpbZTpeZvuNaOE2M5VxYDS&amp;TOPIC_ID=16870" target="_blank">clinicaltrials.gov</a>).</p><p>Recommendations for allogeneic HCT differ between transplant centers, and there are no accepted guidelines or general consensus regarding indications for allogeneic transplantation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For malignant disorders, disease stage at the time of HCT and cytogenetic abnormalities have consistently been identified as the strongest determinants of relapse after allogeneic HCT. These factors are closely linked to the underlying diagnosis and prior treatment. Many pre-HCT factors such as patient age, type of disease, genetic determinants, and most comorbid conditions are not modifiable. However, assuming that a suitable donor is available, clinicians have some control over the timing of allogeneic HCT and thereby the disease stage when allogeneic HCT is carried out. </p><p>General issues that complicate recommendations regarding the timing and efficacy of allogeneic HCT include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who have received extensive cytotoxic therapy before allogeneic HCT are more likely to be in worse physical condition and less likely to tolerate allogeneic HCT. As an example, a patient with refractory disease is likely to have received at least twice the amount of therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation) before allogeneic HCT than a patient in first remission. Thus, it may be difficult to separate the effect of prior therapy from disease status in such patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There is a general lack of randomized trials comparing allogeneic HCT with nontransplant strategies. Instead, investigators have often relied on a "genetic randomization" in which patients are assigned to treatment with or without allogeneic HCT based on the presence or absence of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor or, more recently, an HLA-matched unrelated donor. Patients without an HLA-matched donor are considered for transplantation from an "alternative" donor (HLA-haploidentical family member or cord blood) or are assigned to treatment with either chemotherapy alone or autologous HCT, depending on the trial design. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy programs evolve as new drugs and techniques are developed. Clinicians must determine how to incorporate data regarding new therapies in a setting that has previously shown a benefit from allogeneic HCT. Patients referred for allogeneic HCT may have been exposed to chemotherapeutic or biologic agents whose impact on allogeneic HCT is unknown. Patients who have received these regimens may be more refractory to the effects of allogeneic HCT than patients exposed to different agents in the past.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A broad spectrum of preparative regimens may be suitable for various disease categories and patient populations  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87814" href="/d/graphic/87814.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. As examples, nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens permit allogeneic HCT in older patients and/or patients with comorbidities. The underlying disease is important when considering NMA/RIC versus high dose (myeloablative) allogeneic HCT, because there appears to be a higher relapse rate with NMA/RIC conditioning in several disease categories [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As an example, myeloablative conditioning should be the standard for patients with AML or MDS who can tolerate such a regimen, based on superior clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4533.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults: Post-remission therapy", section on 'Nonmyeloablative/reduced intensity HCT'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16121.html" rel="external">"Treatment of high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndromes"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The availability of RIC regimens has also allowed for second transplantations to be carried out after failure of a previous (autologous or allogeneic) transplant after a high dose regimen, a situation where repeat conditioning with high dose therapy may cause prohibitive toxicity [<a href="#rid4">4,7,8</a>].</p><p></p><p>Ongoing trials are assessing the role of allogeneic HCT in other settings and tumor types. Often there is no better therapy to offer a patient than enrollment onto a well-designed, scientifically valid, peer-reviewed clinical trial. Additional information and instructions for referring a patient to an appropriate research center can be obtained from the United States National Institutes of Health (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2F&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o%2FoHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDpbZTpeZvuNaOE2M5VxYDS&amp;TOPIC_ID=16870" target="_blank">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7278633"><span class="h2">Disease type and status</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The aggressiveness of the underlying disease and the disease status (eg, complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], measurable residual disease [MRD], previously referred to as minimal residual disease) at the time of transplant have a considerable impact on long-term survival of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for malignancies. These variables have made the results of studies of transplantation across disease entities difficult to compare.</p><p>A disease risk index was created using data from 1539 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2000 to 2009, and was validated in an independent cohort of 672 patients who underwent transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Sixteen defined underlying diseases were categorized as low risk (eg, AML with favorable cytogenetics, CLL, CML, indolent B cell NHL), high risk (eg, AML or MDS with adverse cytogenetics, extranodal T cell lymphoma), or intermediate risk (all others). Disease stage was categorized as low risk (eg, CR, first PR, untreated disease) or high risk (eg, induction failure, active relapse, accelerated or blast phase CML). These two ratings were then combined to define four risk groups with significantly different estimated rates of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at four years. </p><p>The disease risk index described above was independently validated by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) using data from 13,131 patients who underwent HCT between 2008 and 2010, approximately half of whom received a myeloablative preparative regimen [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Estimated OS at two years was 64, 51, 34, and 24 percent for those in the low, intermediate, high, and very high risk groups, respectively. Using this large cohort of patients, the CIBMTR was able to further refine the disease index for specific patient populations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95118" href="/d/graphic/95118.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Risk classification schemes have been developed for diseases such MDS or MPN.

As an example, in patients with intermediate or advanced disease receiving a transplant from an unrelated donor (actual one-year mortality 44 to 67 percent), physician expectations were appropriately modified (estimated mortality of 38 to 55 percent), while those of patients were overly optimistic (15 to 19 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24292817"><span class="h1">IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A decision to proceed with allogeneic HCT must take into consideration multiple factors regarding the patient's physical condition. Some studies have evaluated the impact of individual parameters (eg, age, performance status, cardiopulmonary function), while others have created scoring systems to evaluate the effects of multiple parameters. These are described in the following sections. None of these factors represents an absolute contraindication to allogeneic HCT. Instead, they must be carefully weighed within the context of the clinical scenario. (See <a class="local">'Determining eligibility'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24292824"><span class="h2">Age</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incorporation of age cutoffs into eligibility criteria for allogeneic HCT is controversial. Historically, myeloablative allogeneic HCT was limited to patients ≤55 years of age due to the expected<strong> </strong>toxicity associated with the procedure. The development of transplantation conditioning regimens<strong> </strong>of lower intensity (ie, nonmyeloablative, reduced intensity) has allowed allogeneic HCT to be carried out with less<strong> </strong>toxicity than observed in the past and has permitted transplantation<strong> </strong>of patients who hitherto had not been considered candidates. While lower intensity regimens appear to be associated with less toxicity, they are associated with a greater risk of relapse [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Many centers continue to use an age cutoff of 55 years for myeloablative allogeneic HCT, but allow for lower intensity allogeneic HCT in physically fit patients up to age 75 years.</p><p>The<strong> </strong>median age of transplanted patients has increased continuously<strong> </strong>over decades, with reports including patients up to age 75 years. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation<strong> </strong>Research (CIBMTR) database shows a median patient age of<strong> </strong>25, 39, and 46 years in the 1980s, in the 1990s, and in the first decade of this century, respectively [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].<strong> </strong>Transplants performed between 2002 and 2009 included a substantial percentage of patients &gt;50 years (44 percent) and &gt;60 years (20 percent).</p><p>The patient's goal of care and/or eligibility for allogeneic HCT may change with age. In younger patients, decisions regarding HCT are primarily governed by disease risk and donor availability, and allogeneic HCT aims to add many more years of life. In older patients, the importance of quality of life (QOL) may increase, while comorbid conditions and the suitability of conditioning regimens play a central role in the decision process [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In either case, QOL can be significantly impaired by transplantation-related complications, in particular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and its treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122403.html" rel="external">"Survival, quality of life, and late complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation in adults", section on 'Quality of life'</a>.)</p><p>The following is a description of studies that have investigated the impact of recipient age on outcomes after HCT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study from the European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) group analyzed the impact of age on the outcomes of 1333 older adults (age 50 to 74 years) who underwent myeloablative (38 percent) or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings (61 percent) or unrelated donors for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Estimated four-year survival for all patients was 31 percent. There was no significant association between age and relapse or nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Relapse was significantly more likely in patients with advanced disease and those who underwent reduced-intensity conditioning. In contrast, NRM was greater in those with advanced stage disease, the use of unrelated donors, and reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. In the absence of more details regarding comorbidities, it is unknown how much selection bias influences whether patients go on to receive a transplant and what conditioning regimen is chosen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another analysis from the CIBMTR, 1080 older adults (&gt;40 years) underwent reduced intensity conditioning followed by allogeneic HCT for MDS or AML in first remission from 1995 to 2005 [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Among those with AML, estimated two-year survival was 44, 50, 34, and 36 percent among those ages 40 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, or older than 64 years, respectively. Two-year overall survival was correlated with pre-HCT performance status. Chronologic age did not impact rates of NRM, relapse, or GVHD.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An analysis of 372 patients aged 60 to 75 years enrolled in prospective clinical trials of nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT reported five-year cumulative incidences of NRM and relapse of 27 and 41 percent, respectively, and overall and progression-free survival rates of 35 and 32 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. There was no statistically significant difference in these outcomes when stratified by age. Greater age was associated with increased bacterial infections and hospitalizations. The incidence of chronic GVHD and the rate of resolution were similar to that seen in younger patients treated with HCT. Two-thirds of survivors had resolution of their GVHD and returned to near-normal physical function.</p><p></p><p>Chronologic age alone should not be the sole criterion used to determine eligibility for allogeneic HCT but, in the context of comorbid conditions, may impact the choice of conditioning regimen. Although it is difficult to agree on parameters to define biologic age, age must be taken into consideration in the decision process. Even in the absence of clinically apparent comorbidities, changes in organ function with age may modify drug metabolism or excretion and contribute to differences in outcome compared with younger patients. As an example, increasing age is associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate and is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease after allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid26">26-28</a>]. Similarly, increasing age is associated with decreased forced expiration volume at one second, which might interfere with airway clearance and infection prevention after HCT. Therefore, it is important to consider age as a predictor of how well (or poorly) a patient is expected to tolerate not only the transplantation regimen but also the management after HCT, in particular GVHD and its treatment. In a study performed by CIBMTR, 1106 patients age &gt;70 years underwent allogeneic HCT. When analyzed in cohorts based on date of transplant, the overall and progression-free survival improved over time with two-year overall survival 39 percent and progression-free survival of 32 percent in patients transplant in 2008 to 2013. Multivariate analysis from that cohort revealed higher mortality was associated with the use of an umbilical cord blood graft, higher HCT-CI score, and myeloablative conditioning. HCT can be considered for selected patients with hematologic malignancies &gt;70 years of age [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19386571"><span class="h2">Comorbidities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening for pulmonary, cardiac, liver, and kidney dysfunction is performed in an attempt to identify patients at increased risk for complications and to help guide therapy. Patients with organ dysfunction prior to allogeneic HCT are expected to have more complications with the procedure. In addition, knowledge of underlying organ dysfunction can guide therapy decisions to minimize further toxicity. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary disease</strong> – Historically, a corrected diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of ≥60 percent has been required for allogeneic HCT eligibility. However, a subset of patients with DLCO &lt;60 percent can be transplanted successfully [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Patients with known pulmonary dysfunction should avoid conditioning regimens that are known to decrease diffusion capacity (eg, BCNU-based regimens or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">busulfan</a> plus total body irradiation). This is particularly important for patients with autoimmune diseases involving the lungs who are considering HCT.

This cardiac injury is assumed to be of greater impact in patients with less cardiac reserve. Cardiac risk factors should be minimized in all patients prior to transplant (eg, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia). The degree of cardiac dysfunction allowed depends largely on the underlying disease and conditioning regimen. In general, patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent or uncontrolled coronary artery disease or uncontrolled arrhythmias are not considered candidates for allogeneic HCT. A reduced ejection fraction and a history of congestive heart failure have a strong association with cardiotoxicity following transplant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Liver dysfunction</strong> – A substantial percentage of patients with hematologic malignancies have abnormalities on liver function tests. Causes include those seen in patients without malignancy (eg, hepatitis, alcohol abuse, hepatic steatosis) and iron overload due to a large number of previous transfusions. Patients with abnormal liver function tests should undergo a detailed workup for etiology, ideally in consultation with a hepatologist. There is an increased risk of developing hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS; veno-occlusive disease) post-HCT in patients with increased transaminases, a prior history of SOS, and a history of exposure to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8968" href="/d/drug information/8968.html" rel="external">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a>.

Adequate renal function is important due to the potential for exposure to many nephrotoxic agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">cyclosporine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">tacrolimus</a>, aminoglycosides and amphotericin) following transplant.

Patients with these infections need further evaluation regarding the status of the infection, ideally in consultation with an infectious disease expert. Patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are at increased risk of viral reactivation after transplant, even if the infection appears to be resolved.

When compared with patients closer to ideal body weight, patients who are severely underweight or patients with obesity appear to have inferior outcomes following allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid33">33-36</a>]. Inferior outcome in underweight patients may be related to aggressive pre-HCT therapy, resulting in a negative nitrogen balance and wasting. Inferior outcomes in overweight patients may be related to general deconditioning and reduced activity; physical constraints regarding the care of patients with obesity who are too ill to care for themselves; and an increased incidence of infections. In addition, inferior outcomes may reflect differences in the volume of distribution of drugs and the impact of weight on pharmacokinetics [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24292831"><span class="h1">RISK ASSESSMENT SCORING SYSTEMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several composite scoring systems are available for estimating mortality risk in patients considering allogeneic HCT.

As such, decisions regarding eligibility for allogeneic HCT cannot be made on chronologic age alone.

Of these, the three most commonly used assessments are the EBMT risk assessment score for allogeneic transplantation [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score [<a href="#rid58">58</a>], and the HCT-CI [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>].</p><p>A potentially important issue is that mortality rates after allogeneic HCT have decreased since these tools were created [<a href="#rid41">41,42,59</a>]. A retrospective single center study of 1418 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT from 1993 through 1997 and 1148 patients who were transplanted from 2003 through 2007 reported a significant decrease in nonrelapse mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.40-0.57) and overall mortality (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.67) in the patients in the latter group [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Similar results were reported in a study of 5972 patients younger than age 50 years undergoing myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic HCT for AML in first or second complete remission (CR) [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. This benefit probably reflects shifts in conditioning regimens, preferred stem cell source, GVHD prophylaxis, and other supportive measures.</p><p>The EBMT devised a risk score based on five separate characteristics, which predicted treatment-related mortality and five-year OS following allogeneic HCT for patients with CML  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67260" href="/d/graphic/67260.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. This risk score was later validated for CML using separate data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [<a href="#rid47">47</a>] and subsequently for predicting survival, treatment-related mortality, and death from relapse for those transplanted for hematologic disease in general (ie, CML, AML, ALL, MDS, multiple myeloma [MM], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], aplastic anemia [AA]) [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4494.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia", section on 'Prognostic factors'</a>.)</p><p>Investigators at Seattle constructed a PAM score incorporating the following eight pretransplant clinical variables (factors associated with a significantly increased risk of death at two years are shown in parentheses) [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient age (&gt;50 years)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Donor type (unrelated or mismatched related)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disease risk (all conditions with the exception of CML in chronic phase, refractory anemia, AA, Blackfan-Diamond syndrome)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Conditioning regimen (all regimens except nonmyeloablative)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum creatinine (&gt;1.2 mg/dL or &gt;106 micromol/L)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serum alanine aminotransferase level (&gt;49 U/L)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1; ≤80 percent of normal)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (&lt;70 percent of normal)</p><p></p><p>By applying weighting factors derived from a multivariate analysis, they obtained a score ranging from 8 to 50, which was found to predict two-year mortality in early and late validation groups as well as three separate groups of patients with CML, AML, or MDS. As an example, the estimated two-year mortality for patients with CML and the following risk scores were:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Score 9 to 16 – 14 percent two-year mortality; HR 1.0</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Score 17 to 23 – 32 percent mortality; HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-3.6</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Score 24 to 30 – 60 percent mortality; HR 5.8, 95% CI 4.1-8.3</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Score 30 to 44 – 83 percent mortality; HR 12.0, 95% CI 7.6-19</p><p></p><p>The CCI is commonly used to predict the impact of comorbidities on mortality from various medical conditions including solid malignancies. However, many of the comorbidities assessed in the original CCI are exclusion criteria for allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. As such, a modified HCT-CI was created for this patient population  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59272" href="/d/graphic/59272.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. This index weighs 17 possible comorbidities for a score ranging from 0 to 29. In a validation cohort of 346 patients undergoing allogeneic HCT, rates of two-year nonrelapse mortality for patients with scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more were 14, 22, 19, 41, and 40 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The HCT-CI has also been used to predict nonrelapse mortality and OS in pediatric patients undergoing a first allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p>While future studies will be needed to validate these scoring systems and other available comorbidity scores [<a href="#rid39">39,40,44</a>], including the Karnofsky performance status  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785" href="/d/graphic/58785.html" rel="external">table 6</a>) [<a href="#rid46">46</a>], all can serve to help patients better appreciate their mortality risk after allogeneic HCT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer", section on 'Comorbidity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3519395"><span class="h1">DONOR AVAILABILITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The selection of a donor is a critical element contributing to the success of allogeneic HCT. There are several possible sources for these cells:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An identical twin (syngeneic, human leukocyte antigen [HLA] identical)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A sibling, relative, or unrelated donor (who can be HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Umbilical cord blood (which can be HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched)</p><p></p><p>General issues involved in donor selection for HCT and the decision as to which donor source to utilize depends to a large degree on the clinical situation and the approaches employed at the individual transplant center. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3537.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Sources of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24292838"><span class="h1">RACE, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The final decision to perform an allogeneic HCT must take into account the psychosocial and financial support structure available to the patient. A plan must be in place to care for the patient's usual responsibilities and dependents during the prolonged hospital stay.</p><p>The patient's living situation must be taken into consideration. Patients are immunocompromised following allogeneic HCT and are therefore at increased risk for infectious complications, especially if exposed to large crowds. As such, patients who are homeless are unlikely to be able to get the needed care post-transplant. Similarly, transportation costs may become significant for patients who do not live near the transplant center. Some centers require that the patient have available or hire a full-time caregiver during the peritransplant period, and this may be cost prohibitive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1403.html" rel="external">"Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p>Low socioeconomic status has a negative impact on the success of HCT, based on a retrospective analysis [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Low socioeconomic status is correlated with a lower likelihood of health insurance, which may be associated with poor health maintenance, and the need to delay HCT. Postponement or delayed referral may be associated with more advanced disease, although such an explanation was not supported by one analysis [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Although many patients have health insurance that would cover allogeneic HCT, even patients with insurance coverage often have a lifetime maximum coverage on insurance contracts, and the cost for allogeneic HCT and subsequent medical care may exceed that maximum [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. As a result, patients may incur major out-of-pocket expenses, thereby exhausting their savings, or even being forced to sell their home. Expenses are due not only to direct medical costs, but also the need for the patient's partner or other family members or caregivers, serving as caregivers, to take a leave from work, thus incurring a loss of income and the frequent need to rent an apartment close to the medical center to allow for appropriate treatment of the patient. Therefore, caregivers must weigh this investment against the probability of long-term success.</p><p>There are disparities in the use of allogeneic HCT among patients of different races and ethnicities [<a href="#rid63">63</a>], and parameters may differ between countries. Studies investigating this association are complicated by the understanding that race is a complex social, cultural, and political construct, rather than a biologic concept. A retrospective analysis, summarizing data from four states, showed that Black American patients were less likely than White American patients to undergo HCT for leukemia or lymphoma [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Results of subsequent studies have been mixed, with some confirming this difference and others not showing a difference [<a href="#rid65">65,66</a>]. Factors that may contribute to this include health insurance coverage, educational status, and health literacy.</p><p>Retrospective studies have suggested that Black patients may have inferior survival rates following allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid60">60,61,67</a>]. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An analysis of 2221 allogeneic HCT recipients reported that Black Americans had a significantly higher mortality rate compared with White American patients (HR = 1.65) [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Black patients had more severe acute GVHD and higher nonrelapse mortality following related and unrelated allogeneic HCT. A matched cohort analysis showed no correlation of higher mortality with socioeconomic status, suggesting that differences may be the result of currently unidentified genetic polymorphisms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an analysis of 6207 patients undergoing unrelated allogeneic HCT, Black Americans (but not Hispanic Americans or Asian/Pacific Islanders) had inferior overall survival (relative risk [RR] = 1.47) when compared with White patients [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. In addition, nonrelapse mortality was higher in Black patients (RR = 1.56) and Hispanic patients (RR = 1.30). Across all racial groups, patients in the lowest quartile of median income had worse overall survival (RR = 1.15) and higher risk of nonrelapse mortality (RR = 1.21) than patients with higher incomes. This suggested that inferior transplantation outcome in Black patients is not fully explained by socioeconomic status; other factors, such as genetic polymorphisms and health behavior, may contribute.</p><p></p><p>Other potential explanations for apparent differences in outcome according to race include a higher rate of comorbid conditions (eg, hypertension and kidney disease, which are prevalent in the Black population) and difficulty in interpreting skin findings (eg, cutaneous GVHD) in patients with dark skin complexion. Studies are needed to address these factors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24292859"><span class="h1">DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Eligibility for allogeneic HCT varies across countries and institutions and there are few strict rules about who is and who is not an appropriate candidate. Instead, clinical judgment should be used for the majority of patients as to whether the long-term and short-term risks with the transplant outweigh the benefits. Risk factors include and are based on performance status, comorbidity, age, compliance, extent and status of disease, as well as the sensitivity of the tumor to standard therapy. We are currently not able to predict who will develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or other complications, but we must inform patients of those possibilities and their effects on quality of life; risk-averse patients may not want to proceed. All of these factors should be considered when determining appropriateness of allogeneic HCT for an individual. The final decision on transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment, and the needs and wishes of the patient.</p><p>The following general principles apply  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87815" href="/d/graphic/87815.html" rel="external">table 7</a>) [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General features associated with superior outcomes following allogeneic HCT include: younger age, disease that is in remission or responsive to therapy with a low risk of disease relapse after HCT, the absence of active infections or other comorbid conditions, the presence of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor, and a good socioeconomic support system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General features associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic HCT include: older age, relapsed or refractory disease or disease with a high risk of relapse after HCT, a history of aggressive chemotherapy, and comorbidities.</p><p></p><p>Eligibility criteria for allogeneic HCT are not absolute and vary by center.

Patients with low HCT-CI/age scores (eg, ≤2) may tolerate high dose conditioning even if &gt;60 years of age, particularly if they have high risk primary cancer that may respond to increasing dose intensity. (See <a class="local">'HCT-CI/age composite score'</a> above.)</p><p>Pretransplantation, transplantation-associated, and post-transplantation risk factors cannot be separated completely, as pretransplantation conditions will affect selection of the transplantation protocol, and both may modify post-transplantation events, such as the risk and severity of GVHD and infections.</p><p>The morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic HCT has decreased over the past several decades [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. This is in part related to efforts directed at optimizing<strong> </strong>patient selection, graft selection, conditioning regimens, and supportive care. We can expect the field to continue to<strong> </strong>evolve, hopefully eliminating some of the problems that currently exist. Two major obstacles that remain are relapse and GVHD [<a href="#rid69">69,70</a>];<strong> </strong>because of the GVHD-associated graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect, these<strong> </strong>problems are closely interrelated. As the intensity of transplantation<strong> </strong>conditioning is reduced, we rely increasingly on donor<strong> </strong>cell-mediated GVT effects to prevent relapse. As an example, the relationship between GVHD and GVT was investigated in an analysis of 1092 patients receiving a uniform conditioning regimen consisting of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> and low dose total body irradiation [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. Most relapses occurred early after HCT while patients were on immunosuppression for prevention of acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD, but not acute GVHD, was associated with increased GVT effects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3546.html" rel="external">"Biology of the graft-versus-tumor effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p>A patient's underlying comorbidities often dictate the type of conditioning regimen that may be offered. Patients with substantial comorbidities and older patients are not candidates for myeloablative conditioning regimens but may be candidates for a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Many older adults are not candidates for reduced intensity conditioning. However, allogeneic HCT may be considered for older adults who are biologically younger than their chronologic age if the following are met: they have no significant comorbidities; they have stable social and economic support; their disease is considered "responsive" to treatment; and the patient fully understands the potential complications and long-term sequelae that may ensue [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].</p><p>Even younger patients and patients without significant comorbidities, whose disease has been refractory to various chemotherapeutic regimens, are not good candidates for current transplantation strategies except, possibly, as part of clinical trials that address refractory disease with disease-specific approaches. In such settings, it is not known whether allogeneic HCT offers a significant advantage over nontransplantation therapy.</p><p>Patients must have a suitable donor, a good social support system, and a secure financial net. They must be well informed, not only about the transplantation process but also about expected or potential post-HCT events, including GVHD and delayed effects, which may become manifest only years after HCT.
