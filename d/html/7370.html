While earlier studies reported similar rates of kidney stones between pregnant and nonpregnant females of childbearing age [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>], a case-control study that compared 945 female first-time symptomatic kidney stone formers aged 15 to 45 years with 1890 aged-matched female controls reported a higher risk during pregnancy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. There was no difference in risk in the first trimester, but the risk was twofold higher during the second trimester and 2.7-fold higher during the third trimester; the risk peaked at zero to three months after delivery and returned to baseline one year after delivery. However, this study was unable to determine if the stone formed during pregnancy or if an existing stone was just more likely to become symptomatic during that time.</p><p>A study of over 1.3 million pregnancies in Canada found an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes in pregnancies with kidney stones [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H755635584"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS IN PREGNANCY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most pregnant patients who develop kidney stones do not have a prior history of stone disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, it is not clear whether such patients have a preexisting stone or an underlying tendency to stone formation or whether factors related to pregnancy are responsible.</p><p>Normal pregnancy is associated with an increase in urine calcium excretion (243 versus 194 mg/day in one series), smaller increases in urine citrate and magnesium excretion (which protect against stone formation), and a rise in urine pH but not urine volume [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The urine supersaturation for calcium oxalate is similar to that in nonpregnant females with calcium stones.</p><p>Additional factors that contribute to stone formation during pregnancy may include urinary stasis, secondary to increased progesterone levels, and diminished fluid intake during late pregnancy, as a result of decreasing bladder capacity from the gravid uterus.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of risk factors for kidney stone disease among adults is presented separately.

These presenting symptoms are similar to those in nonpregnant patients.

This modality avoids exposure to radiation and is useful for detecting secondary signs of obstruction, such as hydronephrosis or hydroureter. However, physiological hydronephrosis of pregnancy  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91799" href="/z/d/graphic/91799.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) must be distinguished from pathological hydronephrosis from obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91800" href="/z/d/graphic/91800.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/404.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology"</a>). For this distinction, it is helpful to image patients lying on their side with the symptomatic side up, thereby potentially moving the weight of the gravid uterus off the distal ureter. Rarely, pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound may identify a stone obstructing the distal ureter  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91801" href="/z/d/graphic/91801.html" rel="external">image 3</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The ability of ultrasonography and other imaging modalities to detect nephrolithiasis was retrospectively evaluated in a study of 57 pregnant patients with 73 admissions for symptomatic nephrolithiasis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/404.html" rel="external">"Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology"</a>.)</p><p>While the use of alpha blockers such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9654" href="/z/d/drug information/9654.html" rel="external">tamsulosin</a> has been shown to facilitate ureteral stone passage in nonpregnant patients, the safety and efficacy of these agents in pregnant patients are less certain. We engage in shared decision-making regarding the use of alpha blockers for stone passage given the limited evidence supporting their safe use in this patient population. Limited data from retrospective studies have not shown any significant differences in maternal and infant outcomes between pregnant patients receiving or not receiving tamsulosin [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. In one study of 207 pregnant patients with renal colic, the spontaneous stone passage rate was 58 percent among those receiving tamsulosin compared with 43 percent among those who did not receive tamsulosin, but this difference was not statistically significant [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].

However, the individual approach to medical preventive therapy depends upon a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's metabolic risk factors for stone formation, which we typically do not perform during pregnancy. Such an evaluation, and any preventive measures that would be initiated based upon the results of this evaluation, should be deferred until several months postpartum. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7373.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Prevention of recurrent kidney stones"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7377.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Evaluation of the patient with established stone disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2431543669"><span class="h2">Surgical management</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2967760327"><span class="h3">Indications and timing of procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for emergency and elective surgical stone management in pregnant patients are similar to those in nonpregnant patients and are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7371.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones", section on 'Indications and contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>The timing of surgical stone management depends upon whether the patient has an emergency or elective indication for surgery and the severity of the patient's symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In pregnant patients with an indication for emergency surgery (eg, obstructing stones and evidence of urinary tract infection [UTI], sepsis, or acute kidney injury [AKI]), urgent decompression of the collecting system should be performed without delay, regardless of the trimester. (See <a class="local">'Emergency surgery'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In pregnant patients who do not require emergency surgery and have an indication for elective surgery, stone removal should ideally be delayed until after delivery. However, if the patient has intractable pain or recurrent UTI associated with a stone, surgical stone removal can be performed during pregnancy and is best performed during the second or third trimester. If intractable pain occurs in the first trimester, ureteral stenting or nephrostomy tube placement should be performed to relieve symptoms and stone removal should be deferred until the second or third trimester. In such patients, stent or nephrostomy tube exchange every four to six weeks is necessary due to a higher risk of stent/tube encrustation during pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121990.html" rel="external">"Nonobstetric surgery in pregnant patients: Patient counseling, surgical considerations, and obstetric management", section on 'Timing of surgery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3895214241"><span class="h3">Choice of surgical approach</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3196796697"><span class="h4">Emergency surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with obstructing stones and either suspected or confirmed UTI or AKI require urgent decompression of the collecting system. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7371.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones", section on 'Emergency surgery'</a>.)</p><p>In pregnant patients who require urgent decompression of the collecting system, either ureteral stenting or placement of a nephrostomy tube is a valid option. However, pregnancy significantly increases the risk of stent encrustation, necessitating the need for frequent ureteral stent exchange every four to six weeks until delivery [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3529129986"><span class="h4">Elective surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Elective stone removal surgery may be appropriate for pregnant patients who fail to spontaneously pass the stone and who develop UTI, persistent urinary obstruction, or persistent, severe pain [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. For pregnant patients with obstructing ureteral or kidney stones, we suggest ureteroscopy (URS) with laser lithotripsy as the surgical procedure of choice. Although shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been inadvertently performed in only a few pregnant patients [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>], without complications, its use during pregnancy is contraindicated due to potential risks to the fetus. Similarly, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) for large volume kidney stones is contraindicated during pregnancy. In patients with large kidney stones that would normally be managed with PNL, temporary ureteral stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement to decompress the collecting system should be performed, and PNL should be deferred until after delivery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7371.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones", section on 'Choice of surgical approach'</a>.)</p><p>With URS, small caliber ureteroscopes minimize or eliminate the need for concomitant fluoroscopic monitoring. If additional monitoring is needed, ultrasonography (no ionizing radiation) or pulsed fluoroscopy (minimal ionizing radiation) can be used. Another option to reduce radiation exposure to the fetus while performing URS is to use an inverted fluoroscope's C-arm [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>URS appears to be similarly safe in pregnant and nonpregnant patients. A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 reports noted nine complications with this technique among 108 pregnant patients [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. These included two patients with postoperative pain managed by analgesia, five with UTIs, one with preterm uterine contractions treated by tocolytic, and one with a ureteral perforation managed by a stent. There were no life-threatening complications or deaths. The review also reported that the cases were from centers with operators that were highly skilled, a likely contributor to success with the technique. A similar rate of ureteral injury and UTI was reported in a multinational meta-analysis of URS in nonpregnant patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7371.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones", section on 'Ureteroscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Holmium laser lithotripsy is currently the preferred technique of stone fragmentation during URS as this device delivers energy to a localized area (depth of penetration is only 0.4 mm), can be used with flexible ureteroscopes, and is effective with stones of all compositions. The potential efficacy was illustrated in a report of eight pregnant patients with 10 symptomatic ureteral calculi and two encrusted ureteral stents who underwent URS and holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser lithotripsy at a mean gestational age of 22 weeks; the mean stone size was 8.1 mm [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Procedural success was achieved in all but one case (91 percent), with no obstetric or urologic complications [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1549182421"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/4417.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6997245"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General principles</strong> – The development of a symptomatic stone during pregnancy is a rare event, usually presenting in the second or third trimester with acute flank pain radiating to the groin or lower abdomen and hematuria. Normal pregnancy is associated with a mild increase in urine calcium excretion and a rise in urine pH; these are risk factors for calcium phosphate stones, which appear to be the most common kidney stone in pregnancy. Urinary stasis, due both to increased progesterone and a diminished fluid intake associated with reduced bladder capacity, may also contribute to stone formation. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Risk factors in pregnancy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – All pregnant patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should undergo basic laboratory testing and a diagnostic imaging study, preferably with kidney/pelvic ultrasonography, to determine if a kidney stone is present and to assess for signs of urinary obstruction (eg, hydronephrosis). However, physiological hydronephrosis of pregnancy must be distinguished from pathological hydronephrosis from obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91800" href="/z/d/graphic/91800.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). If further diagnosis is required following kidney/pelvic ultrasonography, additional imaging options include magnetic resonance (MR) urography, which is not associated with radiation exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91802" href="/z/d/graphic/91802.html" rel="external">image 4</a>), and low-dose computed tomography (CT), which can be used in the second and third trimester but not the first trimester. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Management of the pregnant patient with nephrolithiasis can be complex and frequently requires close collaboration among the patient, radiologist, obstetrician, and urologist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Supportive care</strong> – During an acute episode of renal colic, management is focused on pain control. If drugs are needed to relieve pain, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> is probably the safest choice. Most (75 to 85 percent) stones pass spontaneously due, in part, to the normally dilated urinary tract in pregnant patients. While the use of alpha blockers such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9654" href="/z/d/drug information/9654.html" rel="external">tamsulosin</a> has been shown to facilitate ureteral stone passage in nonpregnant patients, the safety and efficacy of these agents in pregnant patients are less certain. We engage in shared decision-making regarding the use of alpha blockers for stone passage given the limited evidence supporting their safe use in this patient population. (See <a class="local">'Pain control'</a> above and <a class="local">'Stone passage'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Medical therapy to prevent stone recurrence</strong> – Pregnant patients with established kidney stone disease may benefit from some of the same measures used to prevent recurrent stone formation in nonpregnant patients, such as increased fluid intake. However, the individual approach to medical preventive therapy depends upon a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's metabolic risk factors for stone formation, which we typically do not perform during pregnancy. Such an evaluation, and any preventive measures that would be initiated based upon the results of this evaluation, should be deferred until several months postpartum. (See <a class="local">'Medical therapy for prevention of stone recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Surgical management</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Indications</strong> – The indications for emergency or elective surgical stone management in pregnant patients are similar to those in nonpregnant patients. (See <a class="local">'Indications and timing of procedure'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7371.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones", section on 'Indications and contraindications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Timing</strong> – In pregnant patients with an indication for emergency surgery (eg, obstructing stones and evidence of urinary tract infection [UTI], sepsis, or acute kidney injury [AKI]), urgent decompression of the collecting system should be performed without delay, regardless of the trimester. In pregnant patients who do not require emergency surgery and have an indication for elective surgery, stone removal should ideally be delayed until after delivery. However, if the patient has intractable pain or recurrent UTI associated with a stone, surgical stone removal can be performed during pregnancy and is best performed during the second or third trimester. If intractable pain occurs in the first trimester, ureteral stenting or nephrostomy tube placement should be performed to relieve symptoms and stone removal should be deferred until the second or third trimester. (See <a class="local">'Indications and timing of procedure'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Choice of surgical approach</strong> – Patients with obstructing stones and either suspected or confirmed UTI or AKI require urgent decompression of the collecting system with a ureteral stent or percutaneous nephrostomy tube. For pregnant patients undergoing elective stone removal surgery, we suggest ureteroscopy (URS) with laser lithotripsy; shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) are contraindicated during pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Emergency surgery'</a> above and <a class="local">'Elective surgery'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7371.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in adults: Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones", section on 'Choice of surgical approach'</a>.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Stothers L, Lee LM.
