         Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs with head trauma, usually due to contact but also including acceleration/deceleration or rotational forces. Mild TBI is typically defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15, measured at approximately 30 minutes after the injury or, if longer than 30 minutes, then at initial presentation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854" href="/z/d/graphic/81854.html" rel="external">

         ), loss of consciousness lasting &lt;30 minutes, post-traumatic amnesia lasting &lt;24 hours, or other transient neurologic abnormalities (eg, seizures or focal signs) [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "concussion" is often used in the medical literature as a synonym for mild TBI but more specifically describes a pathophysiological state that results in the characteristic symptoms and signs that individuals may experience after a mild TBI. The 2022 Concussion in Sport consensus statement provides components used in clinically defining concussion as follows [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Concussion may be caused by a direct blow to the head, face, neck, or elsewhere on the body with an 'impulsive' force transmitted to the brain.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         This injury causes changes in brain metabolism and neurotransmitters that can cause axonal injury, cerebral inflammation, and changes in cerebral blood flow.

         Concussion results in a range of clinical signs and symptoms that may or may not involve loss of consciousness and may be immediate or occur over minutes or hours. Resolution of the clinical and cognitive features follows a sequential course with typical resolution within days. However, recovery can be prolonged.

         Concussion may occur with but cannot be solely explained by drug, alcohol, or medication use; other injuries such as cervical injuries or peripheral vestibular dysfunction; or other comorbidities such as psychological factors or coexisting medical conditions.

         Loss of consciousness in association with concussion does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         predict clinical course or long-term cognitive impairment [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, the absence of loss of consciousness in a young athlete who has sustained a concussion should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used to justify more rapid return to play.

        <p>
         Definitions of mild TBI or concussion often do not explicitly require a normal head computed tomography (CT). Some patients who present with mild TBI are found to have significant intracranial abnormalities, including contusion and hemorrhage (subarachnoid, subdural, epidural, or intracerebral), either at presentation or at follow-up. When these are identified, patients are no longer considered to have mild TBI as their primary diagnosis but are more appropriately diagnosed and managed according to the identified lesion (eg, acute subdural hemorrhage). However, such structural injuries can coexist with a concussion. As such, these patients may still be subject to other sequelae of mild TBI.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         Animal and human studies demonstrate that concussion results from a rapid rotational acceleration of the brain [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. While most often this rotational acceleration is triggered by a blow to the head, direct impact to the head is not required [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,6,7
         </a>
         ]. When a concussion is caused by a blow to the head, the location of impact does not appear to correlate with concussion outcomes. As an example, in a national surveillance study of almost 2,000 concussions sustained by high school American football players and reported by athletic trainers, the number of symptoms and duration of concussion was not significantly different regardless of the site of head impact [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, top of the head impact was significantly more likely to cause loss of consciousness than front of the head or side of the head impact (8 versus 3.5 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Rotational acceleration of the brain is hypothesized to cause a shear strain of the underlying neural elements with the following associated and sequential effects [
         <a href="#rid9">

         <strong>
          Neuronal depolarization
         </strong>
         – Opening of sodium-potassium channels within the axonal membrane of affected neurons leads to a massive influx of sodium and efflux of potassium. Calcium-dependent release of excitatory amino acids, particularly glutamate, further stimulates potassium efflux. This process results in the effective depolarization of affected neurons, leading to depolarization of downstream neurons, a phenomenon similar to spreading depression [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-13
         </a>

         <strong>
          Local lactic acid accumulation
         </strong>
         – As ionic homeostasis is disrupted, affected neurons are suppressed and cannot fire normal, purposeful action potentials until ionic homeostasis is restored [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11,14
         </a>
         ]. Sodium-potassium pumps work to restore homeostasis, a process that requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Given the massive degree of the induced ion fluxes, a large amount of ATP is required to operate the sodium-potassium pump. This increased demand for ATP, which is derived ultimately from glucose, results in an increase in glycolysis, leading to local lactic acid accumulation.
        </p>

         <strong>
          Decreased cerebral blood flow with mismatch of cerebral glucose supply and demand
         </strong>
         – Concomitantly, there is a decrease in cerebral blood flow for a period of days to weeks after concussion [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,15
         </a>
         ]. Since glucose is delivered to the brain via the blood stream, the increased demand for glucose and its end product, ATP, go unmet. This supply-demand mismatch is thought to result in the cognitive dysfunction and symptoms of concussion.

        <p>
         Most elements of this hypothesis are derived from an animal model of brain injury known as fluid percussion, in which a craniotomy is performed, a syringe is attached to the skull so that the fluid in the syringe is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid, and an impact to the plunger of the syringe generates a pressure wave through the brain [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-12
         </a>
         ]. It is unclear whether the effects caused by fluid percussion can be generalized to those caused by the rapid, rotational acceleration of the brain experienced by athletes suffering sport-related concussions [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although shear stress is the leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology of concussion, it is not the only one. A detailed discussion of the proposed pathophysiology of concussion, including the evidence base for competing theories, is provided in the references [

         Among surveyed United States middle school and high school children, the self-reported lifetime prevalence of concussion is approximately 20 percent [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that as many as 3.8 million sport-related traumatic brain injuries occur annually [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]; the vast majority of traumatic brain injuries that occur in sports are concussions [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, a significant proportion of sport-related injuries sustained by athletes of all ages are concussions [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27-30
         </a>
         ]. For example, in a prospective observational study that captured American football injuries from approximately 4000 athlete-seasons for youth, 12,000 athlete-seasons for high school players, and 4300 athlete-seasons for college players, concussions accounted for 4 to 10 percent of all injuries [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Among elementary and school-age children, sports and other recreational injuries remain a frequent cause of concussion [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence of concussion is highest among boys playing collision sports, such as rugby, American football, ice hockey, and lacrosse [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23,27,29,32-34
         </a>
         ]. Among girls, those who participate in soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey have the highest incidences of concussion [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,29
         </a>
         ]. Concussion also frequently accompanies motor vehicle collisions and injuries sustained during other recreational activities (eg, bicycle riding, skateboarding, ice skating, or skiing) in children and adolescents. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6559.html" rel="external">
          "Minor blunt head trauma in infants and young children (&lt;2 years): Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Epidemiology'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2000, there has been a dramatic increase in the diagnosis of concussion among pediatric and adolescent athletes in the outpatient and emergency department settings [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-38
         </a>
         ]. Estimates suggest that sports and recreational activities account for 25 to 50 percent of concussions that report to the emergency department [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35,39,40
         </a>
         ]. Similar increases in the number of concussion diagnoses made by athletic trainers have also been observed [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,41
         </a>
         ], a fact that is significant since many sport-related concussions are managed by athletic trainers rather than by physicians and other clinicians [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational studies suggest that the incidence of sport-related concussion is higher for high school and college female athletes than male athletes when sports governed by similar rules for both females and males are compared [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,42-45
         </a>
         ]. Based on a meta-analysis of 38 studies, girls' soccer and basketball are associated with a higher incidence of sport-related concussion than boys' soccer and basketball [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Primary care providers are frequently called upon to care for athletes suffering from sport-related concussions [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,31,46
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in one observational study of 1056 high school students with sport-related concussions, approximately 60 percent of patients were managed by a primary care physicians and other clinicians, while about 10 percent were managed by a specialist (eg, sports medicine physician, neurosurgeon, or neurologist) [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In another study of concussion in children 5 to 11 years of age, the primary care provider performed the initial evaluation in nearly 50 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Current estimates suggest that more than 750,000 patients each year are diagnosed in the outpatient setting with minor head injury; more than half of them are children or adolescents [

         Although most studies of clinical findings of concussions in children have focused on adolescents (12 years of age and older), studies performed in children 5 to 11 years of age with concussion indicate similar types and frequency of clinical features [

        <p>
         Among children four years old and younger, the diagnosis of concussion is challenging because it primarily relies upon parental observation. However, limited evidence suggests that the types and frequency of clinical features may be similar to those of older children including somatic symptoms (eg, vomiting, nausea, or headache), sleeping disturbance, emotional changes, and visio-vestibular symptoms [

Although this discussion focuses on concussions sustained during sport, the approach to the evaluation of concussion sustained from other types of head trauma is similar, although the severity of symptoms and course of recovery vary. In addition, those not engaged in organized athletics are less likely to have baseline measures from prior to injury. Furthermore, the role of exercise in recovery is largely unexplored in non-athletes.

         However, preparticipation assessment is performed by some experts to obtain a baseline against which post-injury measures can be compared to assist in the identification of a potential concussion. For example, the authors find baseline testing most helpful for young athletes participating in collision and contact sports, including American football, soccer, field hockey, ice hockey, and lacrosse. Other experts see a role for selected athletes playing collision sports who have preexisting conditions such as depression, anxiety, learning disorders or previous concussions.

          Neurocognitive function
         </strong>
         – The 2022 expert consensus statement regards routine baseline assessment of neurocognitive function as of limited use in young athletes because of developmental changes over time [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Effective diagnosis and management of concussion in young athletes can be performed without it. Nevertheless, some experts routinely perform baseline testing prior to participation in contact and collision sports for young athletes otherwise at high risk, including those with prior sport-related concussions, because the ability to diagnose and manage a concussion during subacute or office assessment is likely enhanced if a properly performed baseline test is available for comparison. The authors perform longitudinal assessments to account for changes in baseline testing related to neurocognitive development. For a limited number of high-risk patients, we repeat testing every year for ages 5 to 12 and every 2 years for ages 13 to 18. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Follow-up evaluation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Based upon observational studies and clinical experience, sports concussions have demonstrable negative effects on reaction time, processing speed, attention, and memory [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. These changes can be detected by traditional neuropsychological and computerized neurocognitive testing with a high degree of validity, especially if properly performed and interpreted baseline results are available.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Furthermore, a large proportion of young athletes with underlying conditions have a symptom burden on baseline testing that would qualify for the diagnosis of mild or moderate concussion after trauma. Thus, having baseline scores in these patients helps to distinguish a concussion from high baseline symptom burden and, in patients who have sustained a concussion, inform management decisions. As an example, in a large observational study of almost 32,000 high school athletes with no concussion in the past six months and who underwent baseline computerized baseline testing, 21 to 47 percent of boys with a prior history of psychiatric illness or migraines and 33 to 72 percent of girls with a prior history of substance abuse, psychiatric illness, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity had symptom scores that would meet criteria for prolonged concussion [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. For patients with these conditions, neurocognitive testing before sports participation provides more information that may help clarify the etiology of symptoms in these patients if a concussion is sustained and assist with proper management.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Thus, many, but not all, sports medicine specialists support preseason baseline neurocognitive testing for young athletes participating in contact sports (eg, basketball, soccer) or collision sports (eg, American football, rugby, lacrosse, or hockey).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although validity of these tests have been established, many factors affect test outcomes, including the mood and motivation of the athlete, the testing environment, method of administration, concurrent illnesses, and expertise of the person evaluating the results [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,67,69

         Regardless of the type of baseline testing, an honest effort by athletes is a prerequisite. Athletes who are motivated to remain in the game could intentionally do poorly on baseline testing in an effort to evade clinical detection of subsequent concussion. Obviously, this would put the athlete at risk and undermines the effective clinical relationship of the medical team. Efforts have been made to build internal quality control measures that make this type of "sandbagging" difficult [
         <a href="#rid66">

         A difference from baseline relative to scores taken after a suspected concussion can support the diagnosis in children with physical findings of concussion. However, these and other scores have not been well validated in children [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71

         ]. Even in older adolescents and adults, the sensitivity of standardized examinations can vary widely. Thus, the clinician should

         When baseline scores are not available, then comparison with typical performance for age on the specific tool may be a reasonable but less accurate substitute [

          47

         It may not be possible to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion on the sideline.

         ]. These assessments may be helpful for selected patients when the diagnosis of concussion is uncertain, especially those who present several days after an injury or who have prolonged concussion symptoms (eg, lasting more than three to four weeks). Visio-vestibular screening also helps identify deficits that are amenable to specific management strategies [

         Clinicians frequently evaluate children and adolescents who have sustained a mild head injury while playing sports or other activities and are asked to make determinations regarding return to school and fitness for play. For most patients, a careful history and physical examination, including the use of child-specific standardized assessments in selected patients can identify those patients with concussion and provide the basis for continued monitoring and rehabilitation.

          Mechanism of injury
         </strong>
         – The location and force of impact and presence of high-risk mechanisms (eg, double head hit such as a blow to the head during a tackle followed by the head hitting the ground) can assist with predicting symptoms and determining the likelihood that a concussion has occurred. (See

          Neurologic symptoms

         – Although a rare occurrence, the clinician should ask about numbness, tingling, or paralysis at any time after the injury, even if transient. If present, there is a possibility of serious spinal cord injury, including spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). Children with this history warrant cervical spine motion restriction and prompt imaging of the spinal cord. (See

         <strong>
          Timing of symptoms
         </strong>
         – Signs and symptoms of concussion occur soon after the inciting blunt head trauma. For sport-related concussions, the athletes or eye witnesses (eg, coach, family member, or trainer) typically can identify a distinct moment of injury after which their signs and symptoms developed. Although a moment of injury cannot always be recalled, failure to identify such an injury should prompt the clinician to consider other potential etiologies. (See

         Neuroimaging may be appropriate for selected athletes in whom neurologic signs and symptoms (eg, headache or ataxia) are increasing in intensity despite appropriate management, or in whom the symptoms persist beyond the typical time (three to four weeks) for recovery from sport-related concussions. In such patients, MRI is typically performed to avoid radiation exposure. (See

         The manifestations of concussion can be obvious or subtle. When subtle, the diagnosis can be challenging. Many pediatric patients are unaware of the symptoms and potential seriousness of concussions and may disguise or hide their symptoms from clinicians. Anticipatory guidance that stresses the importance of identifying concussions to avoid serious brain injury and provides the number and degree of abnormalities on physical examination and/or standardized assessments can frequently convince the patient, their caregivers, and, when applicable, coaches that a concussion has occurred. This feedback lays the groundwork for adhering to treatment, return to school, and return to play recommendations. (See

         When acutely evaluating a child or adolescent with a possible concussion, the clinician should be aware of several life-threatening alternative etiologies that may exhibit similar findings. In patients with a witnessed head trauma, serious intracranial injury is the primary concern. In instances where a definite trauma is not witnessed, patients with acute illness, other than concussion, may be misdiagnosed as having a concussion simply because they participate in contact or collision sports or other activities that place them at risk for concussion.

         The clinical findings of serious intracranial injury (eg, subdural or epidural hematoma) and concussion overlap.

         Children and adolescents with hypoglycemia may feel weak, hungry, and sweaty. As blood glucose continues to fall, they may develop agitation, confusion, and altered mental status, which may mimic a concussion. Insulin dependent diabetic patients are at greatest risk during athletic competition or other exertion. Any patient with persistent or worsening altered mental status warrants measurement of a rapid blood glucose.

         While severe dehydration with altered mental status is rare in athletes or otherwise active children, patients with mild to moderate dehydration may develop headache, nausea, and vasovagal or orthostatic syncope. Furthermore, a crossover study of 24 adult patients that compared euvolemic and dehydrated patients did find that dehydration was associated with visual memory deficits, although performance on the Standardized Assessment of Concussion and the Balance Error Scoring System was not significantly different [

         ). In many instances, the patient has a sudden loss of consciousness followed by rapid recovery. Children and adolescents with this history warrant careful history, cardiac examination, and an electrocardiogram. Syncope associated with dehydration and/or change in posture suggests vasovagal or orthostatic syncope. Constitutional findings often seen in patients with concussion, such as confusion, memory deficits, nausea, and headache are relatively uncommon in patients with syncope. (See

         Given the similar mechanism between whiplash cervical injuries and concussions, cervicogenic headaches and incomplete recovery from concussion can be hard to distinguish. However, tenderness on palpation of the upper cervical spine or lateral musculature and improvement with local measures (eg, padded rigid cervical collar) suggests whiplash as the primary cause.

         Psychiatric disorders pose a significant challenge for assessment and diagnosis of sport-related concussion because some athletes report psychiatric symptoms on standardized assessments for concussion at baseline [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68,92-96
         </a>
         ]. Thus, a history of witnessed rotational head trauma with signs and symptoms of concussion soon after the injury are essential to distinguish psychological symptoms arising from concussion from primary disease. In addition, taking a history regarding prior psychiatric disorder, recreational drug use, and accurate baseline testing of psychological symptoms are an important means of determining if behavioral symptoms are new or changed from baseline. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Preparticipation assessment'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinician should also monitor previously healthy patients with prolonged symptoms of concussion for signs of psychiatric illness. Concussion can cause significant stress to student athletes, particularly in those cases where recovery is slow. Those who were previously performing at high levels in the classroom and athletic field can be dismayed by the loss of identity while they are asked to institute cognitive and physical rest. Students can also feel distressed by the realization that school work is more difficult to complete, and grades are more difficult to maintain during recovery. In addition, students often feel pressure to keep up on their class work during a busy academic year. The buildup of assignments missed during recovery can be daunting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Athletes that suffer prolonged recoveries after a concussion also go from consistent exercise to prolonged periods of inactivity. This change in activity alone can result in sleep disruption, irritability, change in appetite, change in body weight, and depressed mood [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97-99
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to history and change from known baseline, psychiatric testing or referral is appropriate when psychological symptoms are impeding recovery or when a specific psychiatric disorder is suspected. (See

         Overtraining with resultant burnout is an important condition in young athletes that may go unrecognized, especially those competing at the elite level [
         <a href="#rid100">

         ]. Neuropsychological symptoms of overtraining include sleep disturbance, emotional lability, decreased concentration, and decreased interest in training and competition. Although these symptoms have similarity with those seen in concussed athletes, they tend to develop over time and cannot typically be tied to an identifiable head trauma.

         Preliminary evidence suggests that some children exaggerate their symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury. As an example, in a series of 191 patients ages 8 to 17 years who underwent computerized medical symptom validity testing a median of six weeks after mild traumatic brain injury, 12 percent failed the test, indicating feigning or exaggeration of symptoms. In adjusted analysis, test failure was associated with female sex and a preinjury history of anxiety [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101
         </a>
         ]. Thus, school age children with prolonged symptoms after a concussion warrant neuropsychological validity testing to ensure that reported symptoms are truly related to their head injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited pediatric evidence from case studies indicates that, similar to adults, potential reasons for feigning symptoms after head injury include secondary gain (eg, avoiding school or sports), somatization, and depression [

          102

          Definition
         </strong>
         – From a clinical standpoint, concussion is defined as trauma-induced brain dysfunction without demonstrable structural injury based upon physical examination findings alone or neuroimaging, when indicated. Concussion results from a rapid rotational acceleration of the brain. While most often this rotational acceleration is triggered by a blow to the head, direct impact to the head is not required. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definitions'

          Preparticipation assessment
         </strong>
         – Expert consensus regards preparticipation assessment as of "limited use" in child and adolescent athletes and considers it not essential for making most clinical decisions. However, preparticipation assessment is performed by some experts to obtain a baseline against which post-injury measures can be compared to assist in the identification of a potential concussion, primarily for children and adolescents playing collision sports. It may also have a role in patients with preexisting conditions such as depression, anxiety, learning disorders or previous concussions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         In addition to preseason neurologic examination and baseline scores on measures of symptoms  (

         ), the authors routinely perform baseline neurocognitive testing in young athletes participating in contact sports but ensure proper administration and interpretation by personnel with appropriate expertise as well as updated assessments to account for neurocognitive development. However, baseline neurocognitive assessment is controversial, particularly with regard to cost effectiveness. (See

          Emergency department evaluation
         </strong>
         – For patients presenting for acute evaluation, key considerations included assessment for multiple traumas, cervical spine injury, signs of serious intracranial injury, and the presence of neurologic deficits. Once cervical spine and serious intracranial injury have been excluded by history, physical examination, and, in patients with concerning features, appropriate imaging, the diagnosis of concussion is typically made based upon history and the presence of concussion symptoms that represent a change from baseline.

Standardized assessments of cognition are helpful to confirm the diagnosis. Some experts also use baseline assessments are available. Visio-vestibular and balance screening, such as the vestibular-ocular motor screening examination (VOMS)  (

In instances where a definite trauma is not witnessed, patients with acute illness, other than concussion, may be misdiagnosed as having a concussion simply because they participate in contact or collision sports or other activities that place them at risk for concussion.
