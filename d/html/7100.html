HCP is caused by pathogenic variants in the <em>CPOX</em> gene. The spectrum of HCP disease manifestations is broad, and the condition is rare, making diagnosis challenging. Acute neurovisceral attacks are potentially fatal. Thus, it is especially important to make the diagnosis accurately and in a timely fashion so that appropriate treatment can be administered.</p><p>The neurovisceral manifestations of HCP are indistinguishable from those of other acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria [AIP], variegate porphyria [VP], and delta-aminolevulinic acid [ALA] dehydratase porphyria [ADP]), and the chronic cutaneous manifestations are similar to the other chronic blistering cutaneous porphyrias (porphyria cutanea tarda [PCT], VP, and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria [HEP]). </p><p>Because it can have either neurovisceral or cutaneous manifestations, or both, HCP has also been called "mixed porphyria," an obsolete term that was also applied to VP. As with AIP and VP, rare homozygous cases with distinct clinical features occur. </p><p>"Harderoporphyria" is a form of homozygous HCP with prominent hematologic features caused by certain pathogenic variants in the <em>CPOX</em> gene.</p><p>This topic review discusses the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of HCP.

Penetrance is low, such that the majority of those who inherit pathogenic variants in <em>CPOX</em> never develop symptoms. </p><p>The <em>CPOX</em> gene is located on chromosome 3 and consists of seven exons and six introns [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The first pathogenic <em>CPOX</em> variant was identified in 1994, approximately 40 years after HCP was first described [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. A variety of pathogenic variants have since been reported in heterozygous and homozygous cases [<a href="#rid4">4-18</a>]. Case reports have described individuals who have a <em>CPOX </em>mutation in combination with mutation of a different enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (so-called "dual porphyria") [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>].</p><p>Pathogenic <em>CPOX </em>variants reduce the activity of the CPOX enzyme, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Enzyme deficiency and accumulation of heme metabolites'</a> below.)</p><p>Genotype-phenotype correlations have not been evident in most individuals who are heterozygous for a <em>CPOX</em> variant. An exception is some <em>CPOX</em> mutations associated with harderoporphyria, an extremely rare form of homozygous HCP with hematologic features [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Harderoporphyrinogen III (a tricarboxyl porphyrinogen) is the intermediate in the two-step decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III (a tetracarboxyl porphyrinogen) to protoporphyrinogen IX (a porphyrinogen with two carboxyl groups). It was first isolated in its oxidized form (harderoporphyrin) from the rodent Harderian gland, hence its name [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'More severe phenotypes of HCP'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1263882700"><span class="h2">Enzyme deficiency and accumulation of heme metabolites</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) is the sixth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54358" href="/z/d/graphic/54358.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). It is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX by oxidative decarboxylation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117995" href="/z/d/graphic/117995.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. CPOX is closely associated in the mitochondrial membrane with protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX), the next enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway, mutations of which cause variegate porphyria (VP). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7126.html" rel="external">"Variegate porphyria", section on 'PPOX gene variants'</a>.)</p><p>Because CPOX is a mitochondrial enzyme, it can be measured in many cell types (eg, fibroblasts, lymphocytes) but not in mature red blood cells (RBCs; which do not contain mitochondria) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Most individuals with HCP have approximately half-normal CPOX activity [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In rare homozygous cases, the enzyme activity is &lt;10 percent of normal [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Some degree of CPOX activity appears to be essential for life, as no individuals with absent CPOX activity have been described.</p><p>Half-normal CPOX activity in individuals who are heterozygous for a <em>CPOX</em> variant is sufficient for normal hepatocyte functioning, except when there is a requirement to increase hepatic heme synthesis. A requirement for increased heme synthesis leads to upregulation and increased activity of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway in the liver. In this setting, reduced CPOX activity in individuals who are heterozygous for a pathogenic <em>CPOX</em> variant leads to accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III in the liver, which becomes auto-oxidized to coproporphyrin III and is excreted in urine and bile. Biliary excretion leads to high levels of coproporphyrin III in the stool. Elevated urinary and fecal coproporphyrin III during and often after an acute attack is a diagnostic feature of HCP, as discussed below. Patients with harderoporphyria have associated increases in erythrocyte and fecal harderoporphyrin, a tricarboxyl porphyrin [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Heme synthesis is not severely impaired, and hemoproteins are not markedly depleted in the liver during exacerbations of HCP and other acute porphyrias. However, half-normal activity of CPOX becomes significant when heme synthesis is stimulated because this can deplete the regulatory heme pool in the liver, which serves to downregulate the rate-limiting enzyme ALAS1. Thus, the half-normal activity of CPOX in HCP causes disease manifestations when exacerbating factors that can directly induce ALAS1 are present (eg, certain drugs, hormones, or starvation) or when there is depletion of the regulatory heme pool. Coproporphyrinogen III accumulates and is thought to inhibit the upstream enzyme porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase, which may explain why PBG becomes elevated. Marked induction of ALAS1 accounts for elevation in delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous manifestations in HCP are thought to be due to the accumulated porphyrins, which are photoactivated by light and generate reactive oxygen species. (See <a class="local">'Cutaneous manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2204282432"><span class="h2">Mechanism of acute attacks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The exact mechanism of neurovisceral attacks remains speculative (see <a class="local">'Enzyme deficiency and accumulation of heme metabolites'</a> above) and multiple factors may contribute to the induction of hepatic ALAS1.</p><p>Neurovisceral symptoms during attacks are related in time to accumulation of ALA and PBG, as in other acute porphyrias, and these may be neurotoxic [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. Heme deficiency in neuronal or vascular tissue is an additional or alternative potential mechanism [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>].</p><p>Seizures in acute porphyria may be a neurologic manifestation or can also be due to hyponatremia. Although hyponatremia has been ascribed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), when blood volumes were measured in patients with AIP, they were found to be significantly decreased [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. If, as is likely, such contraction of blood volume also occurs during some acute attacks of HCP and other types of acute porphyria, it may be more accurate to refer to this as an appropriate increase in ADH. </p><p>Other factors that predispose to seizures include effects of heme intermediates, especially ALA, and/or metabolites on the central nervous system and vasculature [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. </p><p>Reversible perfusion defects in the brain, suggestive of vasospasm, have been observed in HCP and acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these changes can resemble posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and are not specific to porphyria. Central nervous system imaging is helpful in eliminating other possible diagnoses but does not confirm or refute a diagnosis of acute porphyria. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Neuronal pathology in individuals with HCP-associated peripheral neuropathy has revealed dying-back axonal degeneration [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Nerve biopsy is not indicated for evaluation or diagnosis of porphyria but may be done in rare cases in which another diagnosis is being considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2095130358"><span class="h2">Precipitating factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are a number of factors that can precipitate or contribute to an acute neurovisceral attack in an individual with HCP. These are the same factors that can precipitate acute attacks in the other acute porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria [AIP] and variegate porphyria [VP]). Much of the information about exacerbating factors for acute neurovisceral attacks has come from patients with AIP, which is the most common acute porphyria. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Exacerbating factors'</a>.)</p><p>Triggering factors for acute neurovisceral attacks can be broadly classified as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medications</strong> – Common examples of medications that can exacerbate or trigger an acute attack are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422" href="/z/d/graphic/57422.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Clinicians considering medications in patients with HCP should consult periodically updated sources for information regarding medication safety, such as the websites of the American Porphyria Foundation (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fporphyriafoundation.org%2F&amp;token=X%2FkgWQO%2B4KXqmczSrewPBzRDevmtZh8j4O6ocOZccYeUeqO%2FNaV0uoL%2FlUCGqC7X&amp;TOPIC_ID=7100" target="_blank">https://porphyriafoundation.org/</a>) and the International Porphyria Network (IPNET; <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fporphyrianet.org%2Fen%2Fcontent%2Fworldwide-network&amp;token=X%2FkgWQO%2B4KXqmczSrewPB%2BSS2cY1JtfO7wcnKyXNc3DQ%2Blj9gyOm%2BNuP4gKT%2FOf64XAkAaxDceuuuinJpus4jw%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=7100" target="_blank">https://porphyrianet.org/en/content/worldwide-network</a>). The evidence for these listings is often limited and sometimes controversial or even contradictory, and it is useful to consult an expert center for advice, particularly for patients with frequent attacks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hormonal changes</strong> – Steroid hormones, especially progesterone, induce ALAS1 and can trigger an acute attack in some individuals. Progesterone increases that occur at puberty (see <a class="local">'Age of onset'</a> below), during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and during pregnancy may contribute to the onset of symptoms, and progestin-containing contraceptives may exacerbate symptoms. Variants in unknown modifying genes are likely contributors, but these remain to be identified. Such modifying genes would explain why, with normal endocrine function, most females who are heterozygous for pathogenic <em>CPOX</em> mutations never develop acute porphyria attacks, while a minority of others develop frequent symptoms. Pregnancy is usually well tolerated despite elevation in progesterone, but attacks sometimes become more frequent during pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Alcohol and cigarette smoke</strong> – Alcohol and cigarette smoking can contribute to the development of acute attacks. Safety of alternatives such as vaping is not known and would depend on the nature of the inhaled chemicals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fasting and metabolic stress</strong> – Metabolic stress from fasting (such as during crash dieting or after bariatric surgery), infection, and acute illness can also precipitate acute attacks [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p>The mechanism by which these factors precipitate acute neurovisceral attacks is thought to be an increased demand for hepatic heme synthesis and/or direct induction of the ubiquitous form of ALA synthase (ALAS1) in the liver. Induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs, which are heme-containing enzymes) is the main factor in increasing the demand for heme synthesis in the liver. Expression of the genes for ALAS1 and certain hepatic CYPs is upregulated in response to inducing chemicals. This includes most of the unsafe medications (eg, barbiturates, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9769" href="/z/d/drug information/9769.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>, most other antiepileptics, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9864" href="/z/d/drug information/9864.html" rel="external">rifampin</a>); progestins, which are ligands for the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and other nuclear receptors; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>].</p><p>Fasting and metabolic stress induce ALAS1 via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1-alpha, a member of a family of transcription coactivators that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism. PGC-1-alpha is increased by starvation and glucagon and decreased by glucose and insulin. </p><p>ALAS1 is normally the rate limiting enzyme for heme synthesis in the liver, and under normal conditions or with modest increases in heme synthesis, CPOX does not become rate limiting and its substrate does not accumulate. However, as described above (see <a class="local">'Enzyme deficiency and accumulation of heme metabolites'</a> above), the regulatory heme pool in hepatocytes is more easily depleted than are important cellular hemoproteins (such as cytochrome P450 enzymes [CYPs]). Therefore, precipitating factors that induce ALAS1 and CYPs can increase the production of all heme pathway intermediates, and, because CPOX activity is reduced, these factors can lead to the accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III and to less heme availability for repletion of the regulatory heme pool. Reduction in regulatory heme can greatly accentuate ALAS1 induction and further accentuate accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III and other pathway intermediates.</p><p>Plasma porphyrins become elevated in some patients with HCP, and cutaneous manifestations can then develop after exposure to sunlight and, to a lesser extent, to certain forms of artificial light (light with wavelengths in the range of 380 to 420 nm; the ultraviolet A [UVA]-visible light intersection). These wavelengths, which are not removed when light passes through window glass, photoactivate porphyrins in skin capillaries or cells, with release of activated oxygen species that damage cells.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9950268"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HCP is found throughout the world. Among the acute porphyrias, HCP is less common than acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and variegate porphyria (VP) but more common than delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase porphyria (ADP). </p><p>The prevalence of HCP has been estimated at approximately two to five per million population [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. In a study from the European Porphyria Network, the relative incidence for symptomatic AIP versus VP versus HCP was 1.00 to 0.62 to 0.15 [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The prevalence of pathogenic <em>CPOX</em> variants is unknown, but the great majority of individuals with such variants never manifest clinical disease. </p><p>While the frequency of <em>CPOX </em>mutations is the same in males and females in HCP kindreds, disease manifestations are more common in females than males (2-5 to 1 in one series) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. This may reflect the role of sex hormones in precipitating acute attacks.

In individuals with advanced kidney disease, PBG can be measured in serum.

However, urine PBG and porphyrins are send-out tests at most medical centers. The send-out laboratory should be made aware if a result is needed urgently; they should also be asked to normalize the final result to creatinine, which is not done routinely in all laboratories. Results expressed per liter of urine can be reported initially, but this may be misleadingly low if the urine sample happens to be dilute. A substantial elevation in PBG (usually &gt;10 mg/g creatinine) is a highly specific finding and confirms that the patient has one of the acute porphyrias and is sufficient to initiate treatment if clinically indicated  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036" href="/z/d/graphic/89036.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).

Elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) distinguishes acute hepatic porphyrias from non-porphyria conditions, and excretion patterns of heme pathway intermediates (PBG, delta-aminolevulinic acid [ALA], porphyrins) in urine, plasma, and feces distinguish the acute porphyrias from each other.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other acute porphyrias</strong> – Like HCP, other acute porphyrias can cause acute attacks of abdominal and neuropsychiatric symptoms and increases in urinary porphyrin precursors (PBG, ALA) and porphyrins. Other acute porphyrias have different patterns of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins in blood, urine, erythrocytes, and stool  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572" href="/z/d/graphic/60572.html" rel="external">table 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036" href="/z/d/graphic/89036.html" rel="external">table 4</a>); and some (variegate porphyria [VP] and less commonly HCP) have skin manifestations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51032" href="/z/d/graphic/51032.html" rel="external">table 7</a>). Because attacks of all acute porphyrias are treated in the same manner, it is not important to differentiate them before treatment is started for an acute attack if a substantial elevation in PBG has been documented; however, samples needed for differentiating these disorders should be collected before treatment. Genetic testing is best obtained after biochemical diagnosis of one of these acute porphyrias.

AIP and VP are more common than HCP. Like HCP, AIP is characterized by elevated urinary PBG, especially during an acute attack. PBG elevations may be higher in AIP than in HCP or VP and may return to normal more quickly in the latter conditions. VP (and less commonly, HCP) may cause blistering photosensitivity, which does not occur in AIP except in cases where concomitant chronic renal failure increases plasma porphyrin levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7096.html" rel="external">"Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>VP</strong> – Variegate porphyria (VP) is an acute neurovisceral porphyria like HCP. Like HCP, VP can cause either neurovisceral or cutaneous manifestations, which may occur together or at different times. Like HCP, VP is characterized by elevated urinary PBG and urine and fecal porphyrins, especially during an acute attack. Compared with HCP, VP is much more common and more likely to cause blistering photosensitivity, and in VP, the elevated fecal porphyrins include both coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin (in HCP, coproporphyrin III predominates substantially. The coproporphyrin III/I ratio is elevated in HCP as well as VP and AIP). Compared with HCP, VP is more likely to have increased plasma porphyrins, with a characteristic peak fluorescence at approximately 626 nm when plasma is diluted at neutral pH; this fluorescence peak distinguishes VP from all other types of porphyria [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].

ADP is extremely rare. Unlike HCP, ADP is characterized by elevated urinary ALA, increased urinary coproporphyrin III, normal levels of urinary PBG, and markedly increased zinc protoporphyrin in erythrocytes.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (and X-linked protoporphyria) cause nonblistering photosensitivity and can cause abdominal pain due to biliary stones or protoporphyric hepatopathy. Unlike HCP, patients with protoporphyrias lack elevations in urinary PBG and porphyrins. Thus, a biochemical evaluation can determine the type of cutaneous porphyria  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89035" href="/z/d/graphic/89035.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89123" href="/z/d/graphic/89123.html" rel="external">algorithm 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other causes of abdominal pain</strong> – Abdominal pain can occur in numerous clinical settings and is often difficult to diagnose. Unlike HCP (and other acute porphyrias), other causes of abdominal pain do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. However, other causes of abdominal pain may be associated with elevations in urinary porphyrins (eg, hepatobiliary disease) or ALA (eg, lead poisoning). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6862.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6860.html" rel="external">"Causes of abdominal pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Importantly, an individual known to have porphyria may present with another cause of abdominal pain (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory or ischemic bowel disease, renal stones), and these conditions can precipitate an acute porphyria attack.

Examples include neurodegenerative disease, alcohol and drug use, psychiatric illness, and psychotropic medications. Like HCP, some of these other conditions may be associated with hyponatremia and increased antidiuretic hormone secretion. Unlike HCP, these other causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms do not cause elevations of urinary PBG.

This occurs because coproporphyrin is excreted in both bile and urine, and more appears in the urine when hepatobiliary function is impaired. Unlike HCP, patients with liver disease do not have elevated PBG (although they may have slight elevations in ALA) and often have slight or even substantial elevations in porphyrins (especially coproporphyrin).

The patient and others should understand that without confirmation by a high PBG, the clinical diagnosis of acute porphyria is provisional and may not be confirmed even in a patient with "classic" (but nonspecific) symptoms. However, starting hemin treatment <strong>without</strong> sending urine for PBG creates a difficult diagnostic situation because PBG and porphyrin levels are rapidly lowered by hemin and for an unpredictable period of time, so later PBG determinations may be normal even if initial samples would have been elevated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For established patients who present with symptoms of an acute attack, treatment is started based on the clinical findings and should not be delayed while determining the presence or degree of urinary PBG elevation (unless this information can be obtained within a few hours).

Inheritance of HCP is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. The cause is deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117995" href="/z/d/graphic/117995.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), which converts coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54358" href="/z/d/graphic/54358.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Multiple different pathogenic variants in the <em>CPOX </em>gene have been identified in unrelated HCP patients. Neurotoxic effects are thought to be due to accumulation of heme precursors (especially delta-aminolevulinic acid). Cutaneous effects are attributed to light activation of porphyrins that circulate to the skin. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> – HCP affects approximately two to five per million population. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presentation</strong> – HCP typically manifests after puberty; diagnostic delays are common. Neurovisceral attacks may cause central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, with abdominal pain as the most common symptom  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856" href="/z/d/graphic/56856.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Cutaneous manifestations are uncommon and include blistering, scarring, and pigment changes on sun-exposed skin. Chronic neurologic symptoms, depression, liver enzyme elevations, and hepatocellular carcinoma can occur.

Further testing determines the type of porphyria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036" href="/z/d/graphic/89036.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).
