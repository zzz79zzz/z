         Variola virus is the causative agent of smallpox, a highly infectious disease characterized by fever, rash, and a high mortality rate. In 1979, the global eradication of smallpox was announced, marking one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Several factors facilitated eradication [

         Although there have been no reported cases since eradication, continued interest in this virus remains because of the concern regarding smallpox as a potential agent of bioterrorism [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. There are lessons that were learned from smallpox eradication that can be applied to the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic [

         Smallpox occurred in two forms: variola major, which was a serious illness with a mortality rate of 30 to 50 percent in the unvaccinated individual, and variola minor, which was a milder infection with a mortality rate of less than 1 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         ]. The two forms are caused by different strains of variola virus. (See

         In the past, smallpox was endemic. The illness was described in Asia during the first century AD, in Europe and Africa around 700 AD, and in Central, South, and North America during the 16
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         and 17
         <sup>

         centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
         In temperate climates, endemic smallpox occurred in winter and spring and was mainly a disease of children and young adults [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. There was less seasonal variability in tropical climates, where there were fewer fluctuations in temperature and humidity. However, in regions that had distinct hot (high humidity) and cool (low humidity) seasons, the incidence of smallpox was always much higher in the cool, dry season [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Endemic variola major was eradicated from the United States in 1926, and variola minor during the 1940s. Eradication was slower in Asia, Africa, and in parts of the Americas. The last naturally occurring smallpox infection occurred in Somalia in October 1977 [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The last known case in the world, in September 1978, resulted from a laboratory accident in Birmingham, England.

         Smallpox can only be spread through humans. It is mainly spread by respiratory viral shedding (eg, via sneezing or coughing) and requires fairly prolonged direct contact between people [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Patients with smallpox become contagious as the first lesions appear in their mouth and throat, and infectivity appears to be the highest at the beginning of the rash. Patients remain contagious until their last scabs fall off.
        </p>
        <p>
         Transmission can also occur through contact with the fluid found in the patient's sores, since they also contain variola virus [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The virus can spread through direct contact with these materials or through the objects contaminated by them, such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has spread through the air in enclosed settings, such as a building (airborne route).
        </p>
        <p>
         Before smallpox was eradicated, transmission was usually confined to unimmunized persons sharing living quarters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among unvaccinated family members, approximately 58 percent contracted smallpox compared with 4 percent in vaccinees. The severity of the illness, which usually confined the patient to bed and restricted contact, may have contributed to the relatively low attack rate. Because of long incubation times, transmission intervals were two to three weeks apart; thus, new cases of smallpox would appear in a community over many months.

        <p>
         Variola virus is a large (200 to 400 nm) DNA virus that lacks icosahedral symmetry, unlike most other DNA viruses. The virus has a complex structure with an outer membrane, two lateral bodies, and a dumbbell-shaped core that contains a single molecule of double-stranded DNA [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The entire 186,000-base pair genome has been sequenced [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. The majority of the genes are closely related to the genes of vaccinia virus [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. When viewed by electron microscopy, variola virus appears brick shaped  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56100" href="/z/d/graphic/56100.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the 1800s, a milder form of smallpox was recognized in the Americas, which was later identified as variola minor. Sequencing of the virus clearly indicated it was a different strain of variola virus [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. While variola minor strains have high sequence similarity to variola major strains, it is believed that changes in differential gene expression may explain the differences in virulence. Newer diagnostic tests can now differentiate the two strains of virus [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         Spread of upper airway secretions, including secretions from the oropharynx, leads to person-to-person transmission of smallpox virus [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,17
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Inhaled secretions containing variola virus enter the respiratory tract, where viruses multiply locally and then spread to regional lymph nodes via circulating macrophages [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Multiplication within lymph nodes then leads to a primary viremia with dissemination of virus to lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. Viral amplification within lymphoid organs leads to a secondary viremia, which is associated with the onset of symptoms and the characteristic smallpox rash. Virus can be isolated from the oropharynx, skin lesions, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and kidneys.
        </p>
        <p>
         Virus that localizes within small dermal blood vessels produces endothelial swelling and infection of epidermal cells, resulting in characteristic vesicles in skin and mucous membranes. When stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the cytoplasm of infected cells contains characteristic inclusions, called Guarnieri bodies, which are faintly basophilic or acidophilic  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59400" href="/z/d/graphic/59400.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Extension of infection into the corium and sebaceous glands produces the "pockmarks" or scars which, upon healing, are hallmarks of prior smallpox infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Variola virus infection stimulates specific cytotoxic T cell responses, neutralizing antibodies, and the production of interferons [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These immune responses restrict viral replication and induce prolonged immunity in the patients who recover. In one study, survivors had evidence of variola virus-specific CD4+ memory T cell lymphoproliferative responses and neutralizing antibodies greater than 40 years after infection [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19

         As noted above, smallpox occurred in two forms: variola major, which was a serious illness, and variola minor, which was a milder infection. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, the two infections cannot be clinically distinguished in an individual patient. Prior to the eradication of smallpox, the distinction became clear only based on the epidemiology of the outbreak; for example, when low mortality was seen, the infection would be attributed to variola minor. Modern molecular diagnostic techniques could likely distinguish between the two strains of variola [

         In a typical case of ordinary type smallpox, the incubation period was 10 to 14 days (range 7 to 19 days) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

        <p>
         The eruptive phase was characterized by lesions on the mucous membranes (enanthem) followed approximately 24 hours later by the cutaneous rash (exanthem). Intraoral lesions first appeared as papules followed by vesicles on the tongue and palate. The spread of the exanthem was centrifugal, involving initially the face, followed by proximal extremities, the trunk, and the distal extremities [

         ]. The exanthem began as small macules ("herald spots") on the face. Macules evolved to papules by day 2 of the rash, vesicles by days 4 to 5, and pustules by day 7. Fever occasionally recurred during the pustular phase [

         The modified form of smallpox was similar to ordinary disease, except that the phases of the rash developed more rapidly and pustular lesions were smaller. Modified smallpox was common in vaccinated patients who became infected despite immunization and in those intentionally infected by variolation, a procedure that had been widely used as a method of vaccination prior to vaccinia virus vaccination [

         In this rare form of smallpox, skin lesions and mucous membranes became hemorrhagic. Profound prostration, heart failure, diffuse bleeding, and bone marrow suppression commonly resulted in a fatal outcome within three to four days, earning it the name "sledgehammer smallpox." Pregnant women were predisposed to this type of smallpox. However, hemorrhagic smallpox was difficult to recognize unless the patient had a known exposure to a patient with smallpox [

         Since smallpox was eradicated in 1979, most clinicians have not seen a case of smallpox and, therefore, may not recognize the characteristic lesions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has proposed both major and minor clinical diagnostic criteria for smallpox in the event that variola virus could be used as an agent of bioterrorism [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. These criteria determine the subsequent public health response. A description of these criteria and the approach to evaluating a patient with potential signs and symptoms of smallpox are presented in the algorithm  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         If a presumptive diagnosis of smallpox is being considered, appropriate infection control precautions must be instituted. (See

         A variety of disorders may be considered in the differential diagnosis of smallpox, including varicella, monkeypox, or tanapox infections  (

          table 1

         <strong>
          Varicella
         </strong>
         – In patients with varicella infection (chickenpox), lesions are in various stages of development, whereas in smallpox, all lesions appear morphologically similar. In addition, patients with varicella infection usually appear less ill. However, distinguishing mild to moderate varicella infection from smallpox was particularly difficult during epidemics of variola minor or when mild smallpox infection developed in patients previously immunized with vaccinia. (See

         <strong>
          Monkeypox
         </strong>
         – The rash of human monkeypox can be difficult to distinguish from smallpox. Key distinguishing clinical features are that monkeypox is associated with cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and patients appear less ill than patients with smallpox. Patients with monkeypox may also have a history of travel to Africa or exposure to an animal from this geographic region (See

          Tanapox

         – Tanapox infection is another poxvirus infection acquired in Africa that might be confused with smallpox. It infects non-human primates and is believed to be transmitted to humans by an arthropod intermediate. However, unlike smallpox, this infection is self-limited, and the rash is usually localized [

         ]; this benefit was seen even when the drug was administered at later stages of illness. Tecovirimat is the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that was developed under the "Animal Rule." This rule allows approval of drugs based upon well-controlled animal efficacy studies when the agent treats or prevents serious or life-threatening conditions and when human efficacy studies are not ethical and field trials are not feasible. Tecovirimat has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of non-human primates challenged with variola virus [
         <a href="#rid32">

         Variola virus is the causative agent of smallpox, a contagious disease characterized by fever, a vesicular and pustular eruption, and a high mortality rate in nonimmune patients. The global eradication of smallpox was officially announced in 1979, marking one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. However, there remains continued interest in this virus because of the concern regarding smallpox as a potential agent of bioterrorism. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         Smallpox occurred in two forms: variola major, which was a serious illness with a mortality rate of 30 to 50 percent in the unvaccinated individual, and variola minor, which was a milder infection with a mortality rate of less than 1 percent. (See

         Inhaled variola virus entered the respiratory tract, where it multiplied locally and then spread to regional lymph nodes via circulating macrophages. Multiplication within lymph nodes then led to a primary viremia with dissemination of virus to lymphoid organs. Viral amplification within lymphoid organs led to a secondary viremia, which was associated with the onset of symptoms and the characteristic smallpox rash. (See
         <a class="local">

         Smallpox was most commonly characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, backache, and malaise. These constitutional symptoms were then followed by the onset of lesions on the mucous membranes (enanthem) followed by the onset of rash (exanthem) involving the face, proximal extremities, trunk, and distal extremities. The risk of mortality was closely linked to the severity of the rash. (See

         Complications of smallpox infection included secondary bacterial infections of the skin, keratitis of corneal ulcerations, and encephalitis. (See

         The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has proposed both major and minor clinical diagnostic criteria for smallpox in the event that variola virus could be used as an agent of bioterrorism  (

          algorithm 1

         above.)

         The mainstay of treatment for smallpox had been supportive care. However, two antiviral agents,
