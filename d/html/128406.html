         A wide variety of lesions occurs on the vulva. Some of the disorders causing these lesions are limited to the vulva, while others also involve skin or mucocutaneous membranes elsewhere on the body. This topic provides a morphology-based classification system that can help clinicians with the differential diagnosis of these lesions after performing a history and physical examination. This classification system is also useful for guiding the choice of diagnostic tests and procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will focus on differential diagnosis of red vulvar lesions. Discussions of white, other pigmented, erosive and ulcerative, and skin-colored or yellow lesions are presented in related content.

         Based on the authors' experience, clinicians should be aware of the following points when evaluating dermatologic lesions of the vulva:

         <span class="glyph">

         <strong>
          Alternate appearance of vulvar lesions
         </strong>
         – Many skin conditions may appear differently on the vulva than on other parts of the skin as the vulva is so moist and the area is commonly subject to friction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         <strong>
          Concomitant conditions
         </strong>
         – Concomitant conditions to consider with vulvar lesions include infections, other dermatoses, and neoplasia/cancer. For example, irritant contact dermatitis from the use of caustic soaps or overwashing is commonly seen in individuals with vulvar lichen sclerosus.
        </p>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Impact of topical therapies
         </strong>
         – Vulvar conditions may be significantly altered by the use of topical treatments. The authors ask patients about use of prescription, over-the-counter, compounded, and alternative topical preparations.
        </p>
        <p>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Role of biopsy
         </strong>
         – Be prepared to perform a biopsy, especially if a vulvar lesion is atypical, bleeding, the patient is immunocompromised, the lesion is not responding to appropriate treatment, or there is concern for a malignancy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. For any lesions with variable or irregular areas, more than one biopsy may be needed. At times, the biopsy results can be inconclusive. If there are ever concerns or questions about the biopsy report, it is important to speak with the pathologist. Sending a clinical photograph to the pathologist can also aid the diagnosis.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Consider possibility of systemic disease
         </strong>
         – Vulvar lesions can represent diseases that commonly present on the vulva (eg, herpes simplex virus) or systemic diseases that manifest in multiple sites including the vulva (eg, psoriasis). Providers are encouraged to ask patients with vulvar lesions about generalized symptoms and presence of lesions or skin changes on other body parts.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Specialist referral
         </strong>
         – Patients whose symptoms do not respond, or worsen, despite usual treatment should be referred to a gynecologist, dermatologist, family medicine physician, or other health care providers who specialize in vulvar skin disorders.

         After a history, physical examination, and morphologic classification  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851" href="/z/d/graphic/95851.html" rel="external">

         ) have been performed, the information in this topic can be used to begin a differential diagnosis of the lesion. Diagnostic entities are listed for each morphologic classification and often listed under more than one morphologic classification since many lesions have more than one presentation (morphologic type, color). The complete description of the diagnostic entity is provided only once; for morphologic variants, the entity is noted and linked to its descriptive section.

         This topic is an overview of red dermatologic lesions of the vulva. Detailed text specific to each type of vulvar lesion is available separately, and links are provided throughout the text where available. Brief summaries of pertinent history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests and procedures are provided in this topic. Discussions of the presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of vulvar lesions are described in detail separately.

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – Candidiasis typically appears as bright red, sometimes eroded patches and plaques involving varying portions of the vulva  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51710" href="/z/d/graphic/51710.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). In severe cases, the perianal area and the upper inner thighs  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95804" href="/z/d/graphic/95804.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ) may also be involved. A slight scale may overlie the red patches and plaques. Small 1 to 2 mm pustules may stud the surface of these patches and plaques, and at the periphery of the main area of involvement, similar satellite red, yellow, or white papules and/or pustules may occur. The pustules break easily, leaving small erosions with peripheral ("collarette") scales. If many pustules are present, the desquamating scale can be prominent  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70637" href="/z/d/graphic/70637.html" rel="external">
          picture 3

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Vaginal discharge due to vaginal candidiasis is usually, but not always, present. Sometimes, white plaques made up of a mat of candidal mycelia can be found loosely attached to the mucous membranes of the vagina and/or vulvar vestibule.

         – The diagnosis is based on a characteristic history, physical examination, and a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation to detect fungal elements (mycelia and spores) in vulvar skin scrapings or on a smear of discharge showing hyphae, pseudohyphae, or budding yeast. Vaginal candidiasis supports the diagnosis.

         Atopic dermatitis is characterized by dry skin and severe itching. Patients with generalized atopic dermatitis may have a personal or family history of atopy. These patients have easily irritated skin and are more susceptible to irritant contact dermatitis. They are itchy and can develop chronic itch-scratch cycles resulting in lichen simplex chronicus.

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – Findings of contact dermatitis (usually irritant) or lichen simplex chronicus are seen and include red, poorly marginated, excoriated or lichenified plaques predominately involving the labia majora and the outer aspect of the labia minora; the vestibule is generally spared. Weeping and crusting may be seen. Scale is usually present with atopic dermatitis, but when the vulva is involved, the scale is often obscured because moisture may whiten the surface of the patches and plaques.

         – The predominant symptom is pruritus. Incessant scratching leads to more itching and more scratching, which is termed the "itch-scratch cycle." Development of numerous or deep excoriations may be associated with pain [

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based on the history of atopy and clinical findings; rarely, patch testing and/or biopsy is necessary to identify an allergen/irritant or exclude an underlying dermatosis. A history of atopy (hay fever, seasonal allergies, and/or asthma) is present in approximately 70 percent of patients and supports the clinical diagnosis. Atopic dermatitis is an important component of the differential diagnosis in patients with vulvar dermatitis as it is often overlooked and treatment is delayed [

         Irritant contact dermatitis is a common condition that is responsible for approximately one-half of patients presenting with chronic vulvar itching [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. This is one of the most common, and most often missed, causes of vulvar problems and often complicates all other vulvar issues. For example, patients that have genital herpes simplex virus or vulvar lichen sclerosus may also have an irritant contact dermatitis. Always ask about all the products the patient is using, such as cleansers, lubricants, and pads, to identify potential irritants  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71478" href="/z/d/graphic/71478.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common cause of this condition is excessive hygiene. The resulting dryness leads to a chapped appearance with minute fissures. Urinary incontinence alone, or with the use of pads, is also a common cause of irritant contact dermatitis. Almost any topical product can be responsible for the development of irritant contact dermatitis. Application of

          Diagnosis

         – A diagnosis of irritant contact dermatitis is based on a history of either excessive hygiene or the persistent presence of too much moisture, such as might occur in diaper dermatitis or in bedridden, incontinent adults. Irritant contact dermatitis may also be induced by a patient's application of harsh chemicals (such as cleansing wipes, undiluted bleach, strong detergents, and rubbing alcohol) or a clinician's application of caustic medications (such as

         Lichen simplex chronicus is a reactive skin pattern with thick, indurated skin secondary to chronic, habitual rubbing or scratching. It is most commonly seen on the vulva associated with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis. It can also be seen in chronically scratched vulvar lichen sclerosus and even in conjunction with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). It is a common cause of vulvar pruritus manifesting as nightly scratching. Classically, there are itch-scratch cycles that are uncontrollable. It is frequently seen in health care providers' offices [

          Physical examination

         – Lichen simplex chronicus typically presents with a thickened, red epidermis  (

          picture 6
         </a>
         ). The appearance is similar to atopic dermatitis except the plaques may be a deeper red or a red-brown  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81018" href="/z/d/graphic/81018.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The skin is thick and leathery, typically with an increase in skin markings referred to as lichenification. Palpate these lesions to feel the typically thick lichenification to make the diagnosis. The diagnosis is usually clinical. When chronically exposed to moisture from sweat, urine, or vaginal secretions, the affected skin whitens  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68426" href="/z/d/graphic/68426.html" rel="external">

         In some circumstances, such as after partial treatment, inflammation is not clinically visible, so the plaques may be skin colored. Lichenification due to chronic rubbing usually predominates, although some degree of erosion and fissuring due to excoriation is regularly present. Excoriation can result in ulcers. Scale is present, but surface roughness may be absent because it is compacted, and it may be obscured because of whitening from chronic moisture.

         – The same "itch-scratch cycle" is often intense, leading to vigorous scratching and rubbing. The scratching "feels so good"; thus, the patient continues to scratch, resulting in increased itching. These cycles become uncontrollable. Heat, humidity, and sweating exacerbate this condition. Symptoms often worsen at night, and the patient cannot sleep. Anxiety and depression are frequently seen in association with lichen simplex chronicus.

Always ask psoriasis patients if they have genital rashes. (See

In the gluteal cleft, the plaques are red, often fissured, and without any scale. Excoriation and/or lichenification may be encountered. In most instances, more typical psoriatic plaques are also located elsewhere (buttocks, scalp, elbows, knees). Rarely, psoriasis is localized only to the vulva.

         – A diagnosis of psoriasis can be made clinically if typical psoriatic plaques are located elsewhere on the body. When only the vulva is involved, biopsy is necessary for definitive diagnosis. However, the pathology report may state "psoriatic dermatitis." In such instances, the clinician needs to distinguish psoriasis from lichen simplex chronicus (see
         <a class="local">
          'Lichen simplex chronicus'

         – Allergic contact dermatitis may present as an acute dermatitis with a sudden onset or, most commonly, a chronic, nonresponsive rash. Its appearance as red, somewhat scaly patches and plaques with nonsharp borders is similar to that of atopic dermatitis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Atopic dermatitis (eczema)'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Rarely, as an acute eruption, there are large numbers of small vesicles, and very rarely, bullae may erupt from the surface of the plaques. The vesicles break easily, leaving small patches of weeping erosions. This process can be confused with an eczematous candidiasis or impetigo. Erosions may also be due to excoriation. The inflammation that is locally present in allergic contact dermatitis may be sufficient to cause appreciable erythema and vulvar edema  (

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A clinical diagnosis is suggested by the presence of some combination of overlying eczematous features, such as erythema, scale formation, visible erosion, weeping and crusting, and a history of topical medication, soap, or lotion use. A firmer diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be made if discontinuation of all topical agents is followed by clearing of the eruption within 10 days, which helps distinguish this phenomenon from irritant contact dermatitis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Irritant contact dermatitis'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Biopsy is usually not helpful in separating allergic contact dermatitis from other eczematous diseases unless numerous eosinophils are present within the dermal inflammatory infiltrate. Patch testing to identify the allergen, performed in a dermatologist's or allergist's office, is desirable [

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – While much less common than the erosive form, papulosquamous lichen planus appears as red or violaceous, sharply marginated, flat-topped papules and/or plaques. Scales are usually not seen. Occasionally, there is evidence of the Koebner phenomenon (the appearance of vitiligo at sites of repeated trauma), and the configuration of the lesions may be linear or angular rather than round. The distribution in the papulosquamous form of lichen planus spares the mucosal surfaces of the vestibule and the vagina, and instead, lesions are found on the labia majora and surrounding cutaneous areas. Extragenital lesions, typically seen on the wrists, ankles, lower legs, arms, and sacral area, are usually found in women with this papulosquamous form of lichen planus. It can mimic other vulvar conditions such as low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or cancer [

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – It is important to look at the rest of the skin for evidence of typical lichen planus. Look for pink to purple papules on the wrists, ankles, and sacrum. While a clinical diagnosis is often possible, we advise making an attempt to confirm the diagnosis with biopsy. The most prevalent histologic finding is a lymphocyte-predominant band of inflammation [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. As with lichen sclerosus, biopsies to exclude superimposed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should be performed for notably thickened or ulcerated areas.

Although these lesions are generally not HPV related, they can be similar in appearance to the usual type if they arise de novo from normal-appearing skin.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A diagnosis of HSIL or dVIN may be suspected based on clinical findings but should be confirmed by biopsy to exclude other conditions such as condylomata acuminata, lichen sclerosus, and invasive SCC. The biopsy should be taken from a notably thickened area or the margin of any chronic erosion or ulcer that fails to respond to medical therapy, especially in the setting of vulvar lichen sclerosus or erosive lichen planus. The biopsy request form should indicate that dVIN is suspected as, without that information, the pathologist may interpret the specimen as a benign acanthotic process such as occurs in psoriasis, psoriatic dermatitis, and lichen simplex chronicus.

         ). The 2 to 8 mm firm papules are made up of dilated superficial blood vessels with hyperkeratosis of the overlying epidermis. Bleeding may occur secondary to trauma. The lesions can be solitary or multiple. They develop between the ages of 20 to 50 years and increase in number in pregnancy. In contrast to cherry angiomas, angiokeratomas are located only on the labia majora; their color is also different: dusky red to purple. (See

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – A furuncle presents as a deep, walled-off collection of pus typically 2 to 4 cm in diameter and usually associated with a follicle. When not associated with a follicle, the lesion is called an abscess. Lesions begin as a tender, red, firm papule that rapidly enlarges and becomes a deep-seated nodule that lasts for days. The nodule may be capped by a white or yellow-white pustule. It may gradually expand under the skin or point at the surface and rupture purulent material. Rarely, aggregates of infected furuncles form large, deep, red masses, called carbuncles  (

         <em>

         <em>
          S. aureus
         </em>
         (MRSA). Diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and appropriate bacterial cultures, which typically show a single bacterial species (
         <em>
          S. aureus
         </em>
         ). These lesions must be differentiated from an infected epidermal cyst and from hidradenitis suppurativa. Furunculosis will typically respond to appropriate antibiotics in 7 to 10 days, in contrast to the longer lasting hidradenitis suppurativa. (See

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – This condition is characterized by deep-seated, painful, inflamed papules and nodules that may occur anywhere in the anogenital area, most commonly in the inguinal and labiocrural folds, mons pubis, and perianal area  (

         Vulvar edema frequently accompanies the inflammatory lesions when the disease occurs in the axillae, under the breasts, on the lower abdominal wall, the vulva, and/or the perianal area. The edema regularly involves the labia majora but less often involves the labia minora. The edema is skin colored, unless inflammatory lesions involve the vulva or adjacent skin, in which case the edema is erythematous. The edema is soft early on and becomes firmer later. The diagnosis is established when the vulvar edema is accompanied by the typical lesions of hidradenitis suppurativa. With time, edema results in the formation of lymphangiomas that present as cystic, clear, pink or red papules.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa is made using three criteria. These are the presence of clinically typical lesions, located in the typical sites, with chronicity. The typical lesions are painful, deep-seated nodules (sometimes referred to as "blind boils"), abscesses, draining sinuses, and tombstone comedones. The typical locations are the axilla, groin, and under the breasts; however, they can also occur on the labia majora and labia minora. These lesions are chronically recurrent lesions for more than six months. All three criteria (lesion type, location, and chronicity) are needed to make the diagnosis. The lesions of hidradenitis suppurativa are differentiated from furuncles and abscesses by bacterial culture (in hidradenitis suppurativa, cultures are usually negative or show only nonpathogenic organisms; however, secondary infection of the lesions does occur). Other distinctive features include a marked tendency for recurrence at the same site and poor response, even to long-term antibiotic therapy. Hidradenitis suppurativa lesions must be differentiated from deep fungal and mycobacterial infections, granuloma inguinale, inflammatory cysts, and Crohn disease  (

         ); however, they can be smaller or larger. They occur on the labia majora but usually not in the vulvar vestibule. Extrusion of keratin from the cyst into the adjacent dermis causes foreign body type inflammation, with consequent reddening of the nodule. The initial inflammation is not caused by bacterial infection, although, rarely, secondary infection of an already inflamed cyst occurs.

         – A diagnosis can usually be made clinically. Inflamed lesions  (

         ) can be differentiated from furuncles and carbuncles by the history of a previously noninflamed nodule, the color, the opening to the surface, the cheesy material, and the grouped pattern. Larger epidermal cysts are also included in the differential diagnosis of skin-colored lesions if deep in the tissue  (

Bartholin duct abscesses are differentiated from other vulvar abscesses, furuncles, and hidradenitis suppurativa by their clinical appearance. They are solitary lesions in the classic location (the 5 or 7 o'clock position on the vestibule, with the labium minus located over the midportion of the cyst) [

          Vulvar edema

         – Vulvar edema occurs in a large percentage of women with Crohn disease, especially when the anus and rectum are involved. Skin-colored or red swelling occurs in both the labia minora and labia majora. Early on, it is soft and pits easily; later, it becomes firmer and pits less easily. Diagnosis is established when edema of the vulva occurs in the setting of established intestinal Crohn disease. The vulvar edema may precede a diagnosis of intestinal Crohn disease. For this reason, a history of gastrointestinal symptoms and possibly a workup for inflammatory bowel disease should be obtained in the presence of what appears to be idiopathic vulvar edema. Edema of the labia minora can cause small areas of outpouching, giving the labium a multilobular or multinodular shape. These labia can be reddish, papular, or nodular. Edema may also result in papules of lymphangiomas with or without inflammation.

         – Vulvar symptoms are variable. There may be no symptoms despite significant swelling and knife-cut ulcers. The abscesses and swollen areas can be sore to severely painful and worsen with pressure from sitting or clothing. Smaller lesions can be itchy. The fistulae will drain and have odor. Any ulcers or erosions can be bloody. Constantly draining, especially foul-smelling areas, is debilitating and, along with the pain, a major cause of anxiety and depression. An associated inflammatory vaginitis causes vulvar burning. Dyspareunia is common. These symptoms may be associated with the cardinal symptoms and signs of Crohn disease that include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – A clinical diagnosis of Crohn disease can be confirmed by biopsy of vulvar abnormalities, which may show granulomatous inflammation (noncaseating granulomas) suggestive of Crohn disease. However, the typical granulomas in anogenital lesions are only seen at the time of biopsy in 50 percent of cases. The diagnosis often needs to be made on the clinical appearance of vulvar swelling, the typical ulcers (knife-cut and aphthous ulcers), and perianal disease (perianal tags, swelling, and fissures). A fecal calprotectin level is recommended. This has an 87 percent specificity and 99 percent sensitivity for inflammatory bowel disease. Note that vulvar Crohn disease can precede gastrointestinal Crohn disease by three to four years. (See

          Physical examination

         – The lesions of SCC are firm, red, white, or skin-colored papules, nodules, or plaques. The surface is often friable. Varying degrees of erosion or ulceration may occur [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. This is most common with the late nodular stage of SCC, such as malignancies that develop in lichen sclerosus and, less often, in lichen planus. The same phenomenon occurs less frequently in the HPV-related type of SCC. It is important to palpate (touch) the vulva. At times a firm area for a biopsy is located, which assists in diagnosing cancer.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Diagnosis requires biopsy, as differentiating SCC from HSIL of the vulva visually may be difficult. Separate identification of HPV-related carcinoma from non-HPV-related carcinoma is helpful since the prognosis is generally better with the former type of malignancy. The biopsy request form should indicate SCC as a suspected diagnosis as, without that information, the pathologist may interpret the specimen as a benign acanthotic process. (See

         Molluscum contagiosum is a DNA poxvirus infection that can present anywhere on the skin of children, but when it occurs in adults, it is usually located only in the anogenital area, mons pubis, and inner thighs. (See

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – These lesions are firm, smooth, skin-colored, white, and red (when inflamed), dome-shaped papules that are 2 to 3 mm in diameter. Typically, the lesions have a central umbilication with a white core (molluscum body)  (

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Diagnosis is typically made by the characteristic appearance  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65763" href="/z/d/graphic/65763.html" rel="external">
          picture 62
         </a>
         ). The lesions can also be scraped with a curette; when this material is flattened on a microscope slide, a Giemsa stain will show the pathognomonic inclusion bodies made of viral protein. Alternatively, a shave biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. These findings differentiate molluscum contagiosum from condylomata acuminata, nevi, basal cell carcinoma, and the lesions of herpes simplex virus infection. Lymphangiectatic lesions (superficial lymphangiomas) are firm, more cystic looking, and yield clear fluid when pierced with a needle.

         Bites from any insect can cause red, inflamed, itchy or sore papules or nodules on the vulva. Bites may be individually scattered over the mons pubis or buttocks, sometimes along the panty line in the case of chiggers, or in groups as from fleas. Scabies can present as red papules and nodules in the vulvar area and buttocks in infants and the institutionalized older adult population  (

         <em>
          Phthirus pubis

         /pediculosis. Careful inspection reveals the 1 to 2 mm crab louse attached to the base of the hairs and small gray to tan nits (eggs) on hair shafts. Insect bites can cause a significant reaction in a person who has been previously sensitized. Secondary changes from scratching are often seen. History and clinical pattern suggest the diagnosis. A biopsy demonstrating an eosinophil infiltrate adds to the evidence supporting the diagnosis. (See
