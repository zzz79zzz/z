Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer includes Ta, T1 (submucosal invasive) tumors, and Tis (carcinoma in situ [CIS])  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef133156" href="/d/graphic/133156.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), which account for approximately 70, 20, and 10 percent of non-muscle invasive cancers, respectively.</p><p>The rate of recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer surpasses that of all other cancers [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], and the majority of patients will experience a recurrence. Management of recurrent disease is, therefore, a critical concern in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Determining optimal therapy, however, is complicated by the heterogeneity of disease in these patients.</p><p>Even with optimal treatment, patients with non-muscle invasive disease are at high risk of recurrence with further non-muscle invasive disease or of progression to more advanced disease. The management of recurrent or persistent non-muscle invasive disease is discussed in this topic.</p><p>The initial management and follow-up of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H602310522"><span class="h1">RISK OF RECURRENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data on the risk of recurrence and progression in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer are derived from studies that included patients with both primary and recurrent disease. These issues are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer", section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1457374321"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF RECURRENCE STATES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who have had one or more recurrences constitute a heterogeneous population, and assessment of risk is critical for proper management. Recurrence can occur in different clinical scenarios, which must be distinguished  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108294" href="/d/graphic/108294.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1174534347"><span class="h2">Recurrence without prior adjuvant intravesical therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recurrence can occur after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in patients who have not received prior adjuvant intravesical therapy. Recurrence of low-grade papillary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in this setting is the most common type of recurrence, since high-grade disease generally has been treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) unless there is a contraindication. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer", section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent low-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer constitutes intermediate-risk disease in most cases; however, it can constitute high-risk disease if the recurrence is both large (&gt;3 cm) and multifocal.</p><p>Whether the patient previously received a single perioperative dose of intravesical chemotherapy is not usually considered important in defining this disease state.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1925460035"><span class="h2">Recurrence after prior adjuvant intravesical therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recurrence can also occur in patients who have received prior adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or BCG therapy. In this situation, it is critical to distinguish intermediate- from high-risk, and prior intravesical chemotherapy from <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical BCG</a> in choosing the next line of therapy.</p><p>Standard definitions of post-BCG states have evolved to guide both clinical decision-making and clinical trial design. These definitions have developed primarily through consensus building between the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Urological Association (AUA) [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"BCG-exposed" refers to patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who received a single round of induction BCG without maintenance therapy, and those who receive maintenance BCG but relapse with high-grade disease more than 12 months and less than 24 months after the last dose of BCG. [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>"BCG-unresponsive" has replaced the older term "BCG-refractory." BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer encompasses patients with one of the following in the absence of urothelial carcinoma of the prostatic urethra or upper tract [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Persistent or recurrent <strong>high-grade</strong> Ta/Tis urothelial carcinoma of the bladder after completion of at least induction (≥5 doses) and one round of maintenance (or second induction; ≥2 doses) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical BCG</a>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Persistent or recurrent <strong>high-grade</strong> T1 bladder cancer after induction BCG (≥5 doses) without further maintenance therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Initial complete response (no disease six months after diagnosis) followed by subsequent <strong>high-grade</strong> recurrence within 6 (Ta/T1) or 12 months (carcinoma in situ [CIS] with or without Ta/T1) after the last BCG dose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with a relapse more than 6 (Ta/T1) or 12 months (CIS) after the last dose of BCG are considered to have a late relapse and would <strong>not </strong>be considered to have BCG-unresponsive disease.</p><p></p><p>Time to relapse is incorporated into this definition of a post-BCG recurrence because it has been shown to correlate with the subsequent response to another challenge with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical BCG</a> [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. The importance of time to relapse was originally described in a study that found that BCG plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8563" href="/d/drug information/8563.html" rel="external">interferon alfa-2b</a> was as effective in patients who had failed prior BCG as it was in BCG-naïve patients if the last dose of BCG was administered ≥12 months previously. In a retrospective subset analysis of 334 patients (98 with CIS and 236 with papillary disease only) who had all received at least one prior course of BCG, recurrence within six months adversely affected subsequent response to additional BCG, but recurrence between 6 and 12 months was no different than recurrence after 12 months. This held true for both CIS and papillary disease. The six-month cut-off has, therefore, been incorporated into the definition of BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer.</p><p>A low-grade papillary (Ta) recurrence does not qualify as BCG unresponsive and is generally not considered an indication to discontinue BCG therapy in a patient being treated for high-risk disease [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>There is no standardization of disease states following intravesical chemotherapy since BCG is considered the more effective therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H872727973"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS OF RECURRENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Recurrent or persistent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is usually diagnosed by surveillance cystoscopy or urine cytology during surveillance after initial treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer", section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>.)</p><p>Technical improvements are being evaluated to improve the efficiency of cystoscopy in detecting recurrent or persistent disease. Fluorescence (blue light) cystoscopy and narrow band imaging (NBI) are being used more widely in the initial evaluation of patients with possible non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, the role of these techniques is less well established for the detection and resection of recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and after BCG therapy [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer", section on 'Enhanced imaging techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Various urine biomarkers have demonstrated a substantially higher sensitivity than urine cytology but with a significantly lower specificity. Despite the promise of urine biomarkers, cystoscopy remains the procedure of choice for surveillance in previously treated patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2968.html" rel="external">"Urine biomarkers for the detection of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder"</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of the upper urinary tracts (kidneys and ureters) as well as the prostatic urethra is also critical in the surveillance of patients with prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Although this is obvious for patients with positive cytology but no visible bladder lesion, even patients with a recurrence in the bladder can have concomitant extravesical sites of recurrence, which must be identified before initiating later lines of therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer", section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2987.html" rel="external">"Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter"</a>.)</p><p>The importance of a detailed evaluation of the entire urothelial surface is illustrated by a study on the site of recurrence in 110 patients who had recurrent urothelial carcinoma after receiving adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Recurrence limited to the bladder was detected in 53 cases (48 percent), while 14 (13 percent) had only upper urinary tract and/or prostatic urethral involvement, and 43 (39 percent) had both bladder and other urothelial sites of disease recurrence.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3658632034"><span class="h1">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with recurrent or persistent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, a balance must be struck between the risk of progression to muscle invasive disease or distant metastasis and the risk of toxicity from treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3811117120"><span class="h2">Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary management of all recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is TURBT (for papillary tumors) or biopsy (for carcinoma in situ [CIS]).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2287149929"><span class="h3">TURBT alone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TURBT for a persistent or recurrent lesion does not differ markedly from TURBT at the initial diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer", section on 'Transurethral resection'</a>.)</p><p>Office fulguration of recurrent disease may be considered as an alternative in carefully selected patients with fewer than five, small (&lt;0.5 cm), low-grade-appearing lesions in the context of a history of prior low-grade Ta tumors and negative cytology [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. For patients with an established pattern of low-grade recurrences, especially if older or with significant co-morbidities, an initial period of surveillance is reasonable, with intervention only necessary if the tumor size or number increases, or the patient develops symptoms [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Persistent high-grade T1 bladder cancer at the time of re-TURBT after initial diagnosis of high-grade T1 disease, based on complete TUR, does not necessarily constitute recurrent disease. However, it is worth emphasizing that the risk of progression in this setting is up to 80 percent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], so patients meeting these criteria should be considered for immediate cystectomy. (See <a class="local">'Radical cystectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, there should usually be no need for repeat TURBT in patients with recurrent high-grade T1 disease after intravesical therapy because these patients should undergo radical cystectomy. If the patient refuses cystectomy or is unfit for more aggressive surgery and does not undergo radiotherapy, then re-TURBT should be considered to stage the patient optimally, minimize the residual disease, and potentially optimize subsequent courses of intravesical therapy.</p><p>Otherwise, the greatest challenge of TURBT in the setting of recurrence is the detection of CIS, either alone or in addition to papillary disease. In both instances, the CIS may provide the impetus to proceed with radical cystectomy versus additional intravesical therapy. Prior TURBT and prior intravesical therapy may increase the likelihood of false positive lesions on cystoscopy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3045620553"><span class="h3">Single-dose perioperative chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Single-dose perioperative intravesical chemotherapy is most efficacious for low-grade lesions at the time of initial diagnosis. The benefit of a single dose of perioperative chemotherapy in association with TURBT for recurrence is unclear [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Approximately one-third of the patients with urothelial carcinoma included in the S0337 trial, which demonstrated the decreased incidence of recurrence with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a> in the post-TURBT setting, had recurrent disease rather than an initial occurrence [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p>A 2016 meta-analysis offers some information about the role of perioperative chemotherapy in the context of recurrent disease [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Instillation did not reduce the rate of recurrence in patients with a prior history of more than one recurrence per year. Furthermore, single-dose chemotherapy in patients with a European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recurrence score ≥5 was of no benefit.</p><p>The parameters that determine the EORTC recurrence and progressions scores are reproduced in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108292" href="/d/graphic/108292.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). As an example, a patient with multifocal disease (two to seven tumors) who has recurred within less than one year has a recurrence score of 7.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1204373182"><span class="h3">What is the role of chemoresection or chemoablation?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chemoresection or chemoablation are investigational techniques that use intravesicular chemotherapeutic regimens to resect or ablate recurrent Ta low-grade tumors [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. These techniques may potentially reduce the need for invasive endoscopic procedures (such as TURBT) and avoid the associated risks of anesthesia. Chemotherapeutic regimens that have been investigated in clinical trials include chemoablation with UGN-102, a mitomycin-containing reverse thermal gel [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], and intensive chemoresection with intravesical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9658" href="/d/drug information/9658.html" rel="external">mitomycin</a> [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. While promising, the latter study is limited by several factors, such as the use of smaller tumors 10 mm or less (which could be adequately managed with surveillance of tumor fulguration), the administration of mitomycin without optimization, and the logistical challenges of intensive chemoresection [<a href="#rid20">20,22</a>]. Further follow-up on durability and long-term outcomes (eg, recurrence-free survival [RFS] and progression-free survival) are also necessary prior to incorporating these approaches into routine clinical practice. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H594672805"><span class="h2">No prior adjuvant intravesical therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>First-line adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) therapy is the standard of care for the first occurrence of high-risk disease. Intravesical therapy for recurrent or persistent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer are used as subsequent-line therapy. (See <a class="local">'Intravesical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>For intermediate-risk disease, however, many patients may not have had prior intravesical therapy, and the disease recurrence may be the impetus for adjuvant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical BCG</a> or chemotherapy. Intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer represents a spectrum of disease, and it should not be automatic that all patients with recurrent low-grade disease need intravesical therapy. A balance must be struck between the risk of progression, on the one hand, and the risk of toxicity from treatment on the other hand.</p><p>For recurrent intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, the risk of progression depends on the size of tumor, the number of sites of involvement, and the rate of recurrence (EORTC Tables) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The International Bladder Cancer Group developed a consensus statement that offers a risk-adapted treatment algorithm for different patient subsets within the context of intermediate-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Based on the number of risk factors that a patient with intermediate-risk disease has, they are treated as low risk (0 risk factors), intermediate-risk (1 to 2 risk factors), or high risk (3 to 4)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108292" href="/d/graphic/108292.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Those treated as low risk do not require anything beyond TURBT and optional single perioperative dose of chemotherapy, even though they are classified as having intermediate-risk disease. These include the infrequently recurring, solitary, small Ta lesions. Those treated as intermediate-risk should receive adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or BCG including one year maintenance therapy, and those treated as high risk should receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical BCG</a> with three years of maintenance therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1543790888"><span class="h2">Intravesical therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment strategies for recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer include both intravesical therapy and radical cystectomy, and are based upon risk stratification at the time of disease recurrence  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108293" href="/d/graphic/108293.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>Optimal first-line therapy will decrease the need for later lines of therapy. Optimal first-line therapy includes key components, such as complete TURBT, assurance that muscularis propria is sampled in the TURBT specimen, repeat TURBT for high-grade T1 disease, use of maintenance BCG, and adequate evaluation of the upper tracts. Immediate cystectomy should be offered to the highest risk patients (eg, high-grade T1 with lymphovascular invasion [LVI] and concomitant CIS).</p><p>Furthermore, it is important not to discontinue first-line therapy too soon and label a patient as a treatment failure. This is particularly true for patients with CIS, who can have a delayed response after induction BCG and should not be deemed treatment failures until after completion of the first round of maintenance BCG.

There are only limited data on trimodality therapy in this setting, and this is currently the subject of a trial being conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG).</p><p>Although not explicitly endorsed by guidelines, a second course of intravesical therapy is often preferred by patients due to the relatively low risk of immediate progression from high-grade Ta and CIS, compared with the risk associated with radical cystectomy. In a retrospective series, the rates of progression to muscle invasive disease and metastasis after repeat cycles of intravesical therapy in a heterogenous non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patient cohort were 7 and 5 percent after the first cycle, 11 and 14 percent after the second cycle, and 30 and 50 percent after the third cycle, respectively [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Many patients are medically unfit for cystectomy, and others refuse the surgery. In all cases, cystectomy has a significant impact on quality of life.

However, optimal first-line therapy reduces the rate of recurrence and the need for later lines of therapy. Adherence to standard treatment guidelines is therefore critical. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2996.html" rel="external">"Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of</strong> <strong>recurrent NMIBC using risk-adapted therapy</strong> – Recurrent NMIBC represents a heterogenous disease mix with a wide spectrum of risk for additional recurrence and progression. Risk-adapted therapy is therefore recommended  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108293" href="/d/graphic/108293.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Prior intravesical therapies also influence treatment decisions. (See <a class="local">'Definition of recurrence states'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of recurrent intermediate-risk disease </strong>– Recurrent low-grade Ta disease is considered intermediate risk in most cases. Treatment is selected based upon the presence or absence of several adverse prognostic features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108292" href="/d/graphic/108292.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>No adverse features</strong> – Patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC who lack adverse prognostic features do not need adjuvant intravesical therapy and can be treated instead with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and a single dose of perioperative chemotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Single-dose perioperative chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>One to two adverse features</strong> – Patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC with one to two adverse prognostic features should receive induction therapy followed by one year of maintenance therapy using either intravesical chemotherapy (single-agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9658" href="/d/drug information/9658.html" rel="external">mitomycin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8663" href="/d/drug information/8663.html" rel="external">epirubicin</a>) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="102734" href="/d/drug information/102734.html" rel="external">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG). Such patients can be treated with multiple rounds of intravesical therapy before considering cystectomy.

The decision to use pembrolizumab is dependent on patient preference and a discussion of the risks of treatment.

Radical cystectomy is preferred over a third cycle of intravesical therapy in any patient who is eligible for this surgery because the risk of progression rises with each additional cycle of intravesical therapy. (See <a class="local">'Radical cystectomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Radical cystectomy should be performed in any patient with recurrent/persistent high-grade T1 at the three-month time point. BCG-unresponsive, recurrent, high-grade T1 bladder cancer is considered to be very high risk for additional recurrence and progression, especially if associated with lymphovascular invasion (LVI), CIS or large volume and is an indication for radical cystectomy. Until the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) clinical trial matures, trimodal therapy is an appropriate alternative in patients who refuse or are unfit for cystectomy.
