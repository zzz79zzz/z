         Vasculitis is defined as the presence of inflammation in a blood vessel that may occur as a primary process or secondary to an underlying disease. Clinical symptoms vary widely depending upon the type and location of the vessels involved and the extent of inflammation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Because of the multisystem nature of these disorders, many pediatric subspecialties, including rheumatology, dermatology, nephrology, pulmonology, and cardiology, may be involved in the diagnostic work-up and ongoing care of a child with vasculitis. Prompt recognition and treatment of these disorders are important as they can be severe and life-threatening conditions without appropriate management.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to evaluating a child with suspected vasculitis is reviewed here. The classification and overview of the management of childhood vasculitis are discussed separately. (See

         </span>
         Clinical symptoms vary widely depending upon the types and location of vessels involved, the extent of inflammation, and the degree to which vascular integrity has been compromised. Many patients ultimately diagnosed with a specific vasculitis will have presented initially with a combination of fever or other constitutional symptoms or signs (eg, weight loss, weakness, fatigue) and laboratory evidence of inflammation in addition to skin lesions. These early features are neither specific nor sensitive for vasculitis and may be found in other conditions including common infections. In patients with such nonspecific systemic symptoms, vasculitis should be suspected if symptoms do not resolve or improve within days to weeks, as would be expected in a "self-limited" infectious illness. In addition to systemic symptoms, the presence of multiorgan involvement, in the absence of an infectious cause, should heighten one's suspicion of vasculitis, and certain patterns of organ involvement in the presence of inflammation may be diagnostic. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6401.html" rel="external">
          "Vasculitis in children: Incidence and classification", section on 'Classification criteria'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Kawasaki disease and immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura), the most common forms of primary vasculitis in childhood, are described as acute vasculitides [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Although their disease courses are usually self-limited, the risk for sustained cardiac damage in Kawasaki disease and potential for persisting nephritis in IgA vasculitis demand early recognition to mitigate the effects of these potential problems. Thus, familiarity with the characteristic features of these diseases is imperative. The combination of lower-extremity purpura, abdominal pain, joint pain, and glomerulonephritis suggests the diagnosis of IgA vasculitis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72094" href="/z/d/graphic/72094.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), whereas the syndrome of persistent fever, conjunctivitis, rash, mucocutaneous changes, and swelling of the hands and feet suggests the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78898" href="/z/d/graphic/78898.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68321" href="/z/d/graphic/68321.html" rel="external">
          picture 3

          picture 5
         </a>
         ). Recognition of these combinations of features is often sufficient to make a "syndromic" diagnosis. Caregivers should be alert to evolving combinations of features when only a few features are initially present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6406.html" rel="external">
          "IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The other primary vasculitides are chronic (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis, Takayasu arteritis) and relatively rare in childhood. Although characteristic clinical findings typical for individual vasculitides have been described, children may have incomplete or overlapping diagnostic features. In pediatric registry studies from the 1990s [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ] and a pediatric rheumatologist survey from 2005 [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], respectively two-thirds and one-third of children with vasculitis were considered to have an "unclassified" vasculitis according to the adult-based American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
         The differences between adult- and pediatric-onset vasculitis are now better characterized [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], and more pediatric patients with vasculitis are classifiable for a number of reasons: the development of a pediatric–specific classification for vasculitis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]; improved disease nomenclature and framework for classification [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]; the incorporation of new mechanistic knowledge, particularly for small-vessel vasculitis, such as the presence of specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies or the prominence of immune complexes in the vessel wall [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         Children who present with features consistent with IgA vasculitis or Kawasaki disease can be managed for the most part by general pediatricians. For those patients with more severe manifestations, or with vasculitis features that are less typical of IgA vasculitis or Kawasaki disease, referral should be made to a tertiary care center where the expertise of pediatric rheumatologists, nephrologists, dermatologists, and other subspecialists can be sought.

         </span>
         The majority of children with vasculitis are diagnosed by pattern recognition because the most common vasculitides, IgA vasculitis and Kawasaki disease, have typical combinations of features that are diagnostic (see
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical presentation'
         </a>
         above). However, the diagnosis is more challenging in children with clinical features seen in chronic systemic vasculitis. These cases require a high index of suspicion since the features may overlap with common disorders, vasculitis may occur as a secondary feature of other systemic disorders, and vasculitic features may be mimicked by other conditions [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the clinical presentation varies widely depending upon the type and location of the vessels involved, the extent of inflammation, and subsequent vessel wall damage with associated hemodynamic changes  (

         Because of the rarity of the primary vasculitides (other than the acute vasculitis syndromes such as Kawasaki disease or IgA vasculitis), a patient with clinical features "suggestive" of chronic vasculitis is more likely to have another disease.

         Differentiating the above listed mimics and secondary causes of vasculitis from primary vasculitis often requires a comprehensive evaluation while considering the differential diagnostic possibilities, including taking a complete history of symptoms and recent exposures (drugs or infectious) and thorough review of systems, alongside a careful physical examination and investigative work-up. A diagnosis of primary vasculitis can only be made once secondary causes or mimics of vasculitis have been eliminated. Monogenic disorders mimicking vasculitis are rare but should be considered in cases that present in infancy or very early childhood [

          Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)
         </strong>
         – If SLE is suspected in the differential diagnosis, then testing for ANAs is useful. A negative test result excludes SLE. A positive test is not valuable, because ANA is present both in the normal population and in other conditions. More specific autoantibody tests are required to support a diagnosis of SLE or other related conditions, such as mixed connective tissue disease. In addition, ANAs may interact with some assays of ANCAs, so knowledge of a patient's ANA status is also important for ruling out a false-positive ANCA. (See

          Pulmonary studies
         </strong>
         – For suspected pulmonary involvement, chest radiographs, pulmonary function tests (PFT), computed tomography (CT) scans, and sometimes bronchoalveolar lavage may be useful. Chest radiographs are simple and easily accessible. Findings such as infiltrates or nodules may be seen in pulmonary vasculitis (as part of granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis) but can also be seen in infection. Measurement of the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) may provide a noninvasive tool for identifying a pulmonary hemorrhage since the only condition that elevates the DLCO above 100 percent is blood in the airways [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. If the patient is too sick to perform PFTs, or if consolidation, granulomata, or lymphadenopathy is suspected, further imaging such as chest CT may be indicated. However, some CT findings are nonspecific, and bronchoalveolar lavage may be needed to determine if an infiltrate seen on chest radiograph or CT is due to hemorrhage or infection, for example. PFT may show an obstructive pattern in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in keeping with asthma.

          Cardiac and vascular studies
         </strong>
         – Patients with clinical cardiac involvement should have an echocardiogram to evaluate for both structural and functional abnormalities. The presence of coronary aneurysms with some other clinical features may be diagnostic of Kawasaki disease, although other vasculitides (such as polyarteritis nodosa), infections (Epstein-Barr virus), and inflammatory disorders (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) also may cause coronary artery dilatation.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Large- and medium-sized vessel abnormalities may be detected by Doppler ultrasound, CT angiogram/magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA), positron emission tomography (PET), and conventional angiography  (

         ). Such imaging should be pursued in children suspected of having Takayasu arteritis (large-vessel vasculitis), polyarteritis nodosa (predominantly medium-vessel vasculitis), or Kawasaki disease (when there is suspicion of vessel involvement beyond the coronary arteries).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The imaging modality is best guided by the suspected location and size of involved vessels. As an example, Doppler ultrasound of the kidneys may be employed if kidney artery involvement is suspected, while mesenteric angiography is indicated if gastrointestinal involvement is suspected, such as in polyarteritis nodosa. When larger vessels are involved, MRA of the aorta and great vessels, including some major branches, such as the coronaries and kidney arteries, may be an alternative to contrast arteriography in children. When the two techniques were compared in 10 children with various vascular lesions (age range: 1 month to 16 years), excellent correlation was found between the images (r = 0.99) [

         – In children with suspected sinus disease, such as is found in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sinus radiographs should be ordered, and, in some cases, a sinus CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required for confirmation.

         The gold standard for definitive diagnosis of a vasculitis remains histopathologic evidence of vascular inflammation. A tissue biopsy may be necessary if the diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of syndrome recognition with or without imaging studies. If the affected organ is easily accessible, such as the skin, the procedure is relatively minor and poses minimal risk to the patient. In the case of kidney involvement, there is a higher biopsy-associated risk but also a high diagnostic yield, and the information obtained about disease activity, extent, severity, and ultimately prognosis is valuable [

         Some biopsies, such as nasal or transbronchial lung biopsy, have very low diagnostic yields. Other organs are less accessible, such as the brain or the lungs. In this setting, the risk of doing the biopsy plus the potential diagnostic yield is weighed against the risks of administrating a potentially long-term toxic treatment in a patient without diagnostic confirmation of a specific vasculitis. Such cases should be evaluated on their individual merits in consultation with experts.

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Vasculitis is defined as the presence of inflammation in a blood vessel, which may occur as a primary process or secondary to an underlying disease. Prompt recognition and treatment of these disorders are important as they can rapidly evolve to being severe and life-threatening conditions without appropriate treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of vasculitis should be considered in children and adolescents who present with persisting systemic symptoms of inflammation and evidence of multiorgan dysfunction. Clinical symptoms vary widely depending upon the types and location of vessels involved, the extent of inflammation, and the degree to which vascular integrity has been compromised.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In some cases, the initial presentation is restricted to a rash and nonspecific constitutional signs and symptoms, including fever, weight loss, weakness, or fatigue, which may be difficult to distinguish from findings seen in children with other disorders  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71389" href="/z/d/graphic/71389.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, in the majority of cases, a particular combination of findings or pattern of organ involvement (pattern or syndrome recognition) are indicative and sometimes sufficient to diagnosis a specific vasculitis, such as immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) or Kawasaki disease, the two most common causes of primary vasculitis in childhood.

          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Patients with other disorders, including those associated with secondary vasculitis, can present with symptoms and findings similar to those with a primary vasculitis. A combination of clinical, pathologic, immunologic, and radiologic features will generally distinguish a primary vasculitis from other conditions including noninflammatory conditions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69111" href="/z/d/graphic/69111.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The initial evaluation of any child suspected of having vasculitis includes a detailed history, comprehensive physical examination, and basic laboratory testing. The goal is to both support a diagnosis of vasculitis and to exclude other, more common conditions that may present similarly. In most cases, the diagnosis of a primary vasculitis is made based upon clinical findings and pattern recognition of the characteristic findings associated with the specific disease. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical correlation with vessel size and location
         </strong>
         – The primary vasculitides are commonly classified and differentiated according to vessel size. Early in the course of the disease, nonspecific complaints (ie, fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and arthralgias) are generally present irrespective of the size of the involved vessels, but over time and with further evaluation, some clinical features typically correlate with the size and location of vessel involvement.

          Additional evaluation
         </strong>
         – If the diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is not clear after the initial assessment, additional investigations including imaging and tissue biopsy are used to differentiate vasculitis from other conditions and to determine the specific vasculitic disorder. (See
