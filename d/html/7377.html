         Kidney stone disease (nephrolithiasis) is a common problem in primary care practice. Patients may present with the classic symptoms of renal colic and hematuria. Some patients may be asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms such as vague abdominal pain, while others will have more typical symptoms, such as acute abdominal or flank pain, nausea, urinary urgency or frequency, difficulty urinating, penile pain, or testicular pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the evaluation of the patient with established symptomatic stone disease (either newly diagnosed or recurrent stones) or asymptomatic stones. Other aspects of kidney stones in adults are discussed separately:

         In patients with established kidney stone disease, the goal of a diagnostic evaluation is to identify, as efficiently and economically as possible, the particular behavioral and physiologic differences present in a given patient so that effective therapy to prevent recurrent stones can be established and the prognosis can be better defined. Thus, the type and extent of evaluation depend in part upon the following:

         All patients presenting with established kidney stone disease (either newly diagnosed or recurrent stones) should undergo a focused history, radiologic imaging, stone analysis (if available), and at least a limited laboratory evaluation. The approach for patients with asymptomatic stones is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See

         If not yet performed during the initial evaluation, radiographic examination, preferably with noncontrast, low-dose computed tomography (CT), should be obtained to search for residual stones within the urinary tract. Diagnostic tests for the detection of nephrolithiasis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Analysis of the stone is an essential part of the evaluation [

          4-6

         ]. Patients should be encouraged to retrieve stones they pass spontaneously for analysis, although novel CT imaging techniques may permit noninvasive discrimination among the main subtypes of urinary calculi. Similarly, stones that are surgically removed should also be submitted for analysis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7366.html" rel="external">

         At least one stone should be analyzed in every patient. Given sampling issues, analyzing two stones provides useful information about other possible and/or relevant components. If the two stone composition reports are sufficiently similar, then future stones do not need to be analyzed unless there has been a clinically relevant change. However, some patients produce more than one stone type. In a study of patients with bilateral stones, for example, the major stone component was discordant between the two kidneys in 25 percent of individuals [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In this setting, it would be reasonable to analyze more than one stone that is passed from each side. Also, if a new stone forms after many years, it should be sent for analysis if passed or surgically removed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Occasionally, treatment to prevent one stone type may inadvertently lead to the formation of a different stone type (though this is uncommon). As an example, over-alkalinization of the urine of a patient with uric acid stones could increase the risk of calcium phosphate crystal formation. Thus, analysis of a newly formed stone after the initiation of treatment is indicated.

         The most common crystalline materials found in kidney stones are calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, uric acid, and struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate). It is not uncommon for a stone to contain more than one crystalline component.

         <strong>
          Calcium oxalate
         </strong>
         – Calcium oxalate is the most common component found in kidney stones (approximately 70 to 80 percent). Calcium oxalate can be found in monohydrate and dihydrate forms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65169" href="/z/d/graphic/65169.html" rel="external">
          picture 1A
         </a>
         ). Calcium oxalate can also be present in combination with uric acid or calcium phosphate. Because calcium oxalate stones typically grow on a Randall's plaque (composed of calcium phosphate) on the papillary tip [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ], a laboratory that examines the composition of the nidus may report a stone with an eccentric calcium phosphate nidus (usually 5 percent) and a calcium oxalate body (95 percent).

         <strong>
          Calcium phosphate
         </strong>
         – Calcium phosphate is found in approximately 15 percent of kidney stones and can be present in combination with calcium oxalate or struvite. Because of differences in solubility due to urine pH, calcium phosphate is not found mixed with uric acid. The two forms of calcium phosphate include apatite (sometimes reported as carbonate apatite), which is the crystal type found in bone, or calcium hydrogen phosphate (brushite); the frequency of apatite is much greater than brushite. Calcium phosphate crystals in the urine sediment are typically dark and amorphous.

         <strong>
          Uric acid
         </strong>
         – Uric acid is the most common crystal form that contains urate  (

          picture 2A

Struvite is found in approximately 1 percent of analyzed stones and is much more common in females than in males (due to the higher risk of urinary tract infections in females). If a preexisting calcium-containing kidney stone is subsequently infected with a urease-producing bacterium, the stone analysis may report that the composition of the stone includes calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in addition to struvite.

         Calcium phosphate stones form in alkaline urine, and therefore, increasing the urine pH may increase the likelihood of calcium phosphate precipitation. While reducing the urine pH would be helpful, this is often not clinically possible for most patients who form calcium phosphate stones (for unclear reasons).

         The presence of certain stone types may indicate the existence of an underlying predisposing condition. As examples, calcium phosphate stones are more frequent in individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism and distal renal tubular acidosis, and struvite stones form only in the presence of an upper urinary tract infection. Uric acid stones may be more common in individuals with diabetes mellitus (due to impaired ammoniagenesis), metabolic syndrome [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ], or gout. (See

         When designing a preventive regimen for a patient, the individual components of the stone need to be considered:

         For pure stones, the focus is on modifying the urine composition to prevent the precipitation of that specific crystal type, even if the 24-hour urine composition suggests a high risk for precipitation of another crystal type. (See
         <a class="local">
          '24-hour urine collections'

         </span>
         For mixed stones, the treatment recommendations depend upon the specific components and the relative amounts present. As an example, for a stone that is reported to contain 95 percent calcium oxalate and 5 percent calcium phosphate, the focus should be on reducing the supersaturation of calcium oxalate. However, these two crystal types share risk factors (lower urine volume, higher urine calcium, and lower urine citrate), so modifying these components should reduce the risk of both crystal types. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7373.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney stones in adults: Prevention of recurrent kidney stones"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the variability in reporting of mixed stones by commercial laboratories, it is important to keep in mind the clinical setting and other available information and to question the reliability of the stone composition report if it seems inconsistent with the patient's history. A report indicating the presence of struvite, for example, is probably inaccurate in a patient with no documented infection with a urease-producing bacterium. It is also important to examine the urine sediment for crystals as this might help identify the crystal type. (See

         Three options have been proposed for laboratory evaluation after a first stone: a limited evaluation, a complete metabolic evaluation, or a targeted approach. Although there is disagreement whether a complete metabolic evaluation should be performed after the first kidney stone, there is general agreement that a complete metabolic evaluation is indicated in all patients with multiple stones at first presentation (including those who have passed a single stone but have other asymptomatic stones found in the kidney by imaging), patients with a strong family history of stones, individuals with active stone disease (defined as recurrent stone formation, enlargement of existing stones, or the recurrent passage of gravel), and patients with reduced bone mineral density. The decision about which option to pursue should be shared by the clinician and patient.

         <strong>
          Limited evaluation
         </strong>
         – A limited laboratory evaluation includes a urinalysis and routine blood chemistries. Some clinicians prefer this approach after a first stone because of the variable rate of stone recurrence and data suggesting that a comprehensive medical evaluation is not cost-effective for patients who have only formed one stone [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. This approach is based upon the availability of nonoperative therapy for most symptomatic stones and avoids unnecessary therapy in those who would not have a recurrence. (See

          Complete metabolic evaluation
         </strong>
         – A complete metabolic evaluation consists of a urinalysis, routine blood chemistries, and at least two 24-hour urine collections for analysis of urine composition. Some clinicians recommend this approach after the first stone because of the potentially high rate of recurrence and potential morbidity from recurrent stones. Limited data suggest that single-stone formers have similar metabolic abnormalities as patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. In addition, there are several studies suggesting that the likelihood of stone formation can be predicted reasonably well from the 24-hour urine values [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. This approach should be followed only in individuals willing to make changes to their diet or fluid intake or to take medical therapy if warranted by the work-up. (See

         A urinalysis should be performed on a voided urinary specimen. The urinalysis should include pH determination since a pH greater than 7.5 raises the possibility of a stone due to urease-producing bacteria, whereas a pH less than 5.5 favors uric acid lithiasis. (See

         The serum calcium concentration should be measured looking for hypercalcemia; if high-normal (which we define as above the midpoint of the normal range), the serum calcium should be repeated. A measurement of intact parathyroid hormone is warranted in patients with serum calcium values in the high-normal range or if the urine calcium is high since primary hyperparathyroidism is often associated with only intermittent and mild elevations in the serum calcium concentration [

          Timing of collections

          23

         ]. One should also wait at least one to two months after the patient has completely recovered from any interventions, such as shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous stone removal. Ideally, the patient should be free of pain, infection, and obstruction and following their "usual routine" when performing their urine collections.

         – The urine volume and excretion of calcium, uric acid, citrate, oxalate, creatinine (to assess the completeness of the collection), pH, sodium, potassium, and magnesium should all be measured.

         However, the values for these definitions are arbitrary and additional data suggest a more linear relation for each of these factors. As an example, the risk continues to decrease as urinary calcium falls below 250 mg/day (6.25 mmol/day) in both males and females [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         Measurement of sodium excretion is also important. Higher sodium intake can contribute to increased calcium excretion and will affect the response to a thiazide diuretic when prescribed to reduce urine calcium. (See

         In many laboratories, two or three separate collections are required to obtain all of this information: uric acid is measured in a plain or alkaline solution, calcium and oxalate are measured in hydrochloric or nitric acid, and citrate is measured in an acidified solution.

         Radiologic monitoring, usually with ultrasonography, abdominal radiography, low-dose, noncontrast CT, or digital tomosynthesis, is warranted for the detection of new stones. Monitoring should be performed initially at one year and, if negative, every two to four years thereafter depending upon the severity of the stone disease and the 24-hour urine values. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7366.html" rel="external">

         Several factors should be considered when choosing which modality to use for radiologic monitoring:

         <span class="glyph">

         If stones were previously visible by ultrasonography, then using this modality will minimize cumulative radiation exposure; this is particularly important in patients of childbearing age.

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         To allow comparisons of stone burden over time, a modality should be selected that successfully detected the number and size of previous stones. As an example, ultrasound should not be used for radiologic monitoring if prior stones were only quantifiable with noncontrast CT, abdominal radiographs, or digital tomograms.

         Noncontrast CT remains the most sensitive test for detecting stones, particularly small stones, but is an expensive option for routine monitoring of stone burden [

Digital tomosynthesis, a high-resolution radiograph-based imaging technique that is used routinely for breast cancer screening, may be an effective and lower cost alternative to noncontrast CT. One retrospective study comparing digital tomosynthesis with noncontrast CT for the follow-up of nephrolithiasis found similar stone detection rates between the two imaging modalities [

         <a href="#rid35">
          35,36
         </a>
         ]. Thus, asymptomatic patients may benefit from a metabolic evaluation and appropriate medical therapy to prevent growth of any existing stones and to prevent new stone formation. We perform a complete metabolic evaluation in all asymptomatic patients who have multiple stones since we consider such patients to be recurrent stone formers. In addition, we perform a complete metabolic evaluation in select asymptomatic patients with a single stone, based upon their occupation (airline pilots, frequent business travelers), complexity (neurologic disease, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as urinary diversion or solitary kidney), or the need for surgical stone removal. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In asymptomatic patients with a single stone who do not warrant a complete metabolic evaluation, active surveillance with repeat imaging within one to two years (see
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring for new stones'
         </a>
         above) is a reasonable approach. If repeat imaging shows no evidence of stone growth, imaging can be repeated every two years; if there is no stone growth after four to five years, active surveillance may be discontinued. If repeat imaging shows an increase in stone size or new stones, we perform a complete metabolic evaluation.

Roughly one-half of symptomatic patients required a procedure (such as shock wave lithotripsy) for removal of the stone, while the remaining symptomatic patients passed the stone spontaneously.

          Stone analysis
         </strong>
         – Analysis of the stone is an essential part of the evaluation. Patients should be encouraged to retrieve stones they pass spontaneously for analysis, although novel CT imaging techniques may permit noninvasive discrimination among the main subtypes of urinary calculi. Similarly, stones that are surgically removed should also be submitted for analysis. The most common crystalline materials found in kidney stones are calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, uric acid, and struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate). It is not uncommon for a stone to contain more than one crystalline component. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Stone analysis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Laboratory testing
         </strong>
         – Three options have been proposed for laboratory evaluation after a first stone: a limited evaluation, a complete metabolic evaluation, or a targeted approach. Although there is disagreement whether a complete metabolic evaluation should be performed after the first kidney stone, a complete metabolic evaluation is indicated in all patients with multiple stones at first presentation, patients with a strong family history of stones, patients with low bone mineral density, and individuals with active stone disease (defined as recurrent stone formation, enlargement of existing stones, or the recurrent passage of gravel). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approaches to laboratory testing'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Complete metabolic evaluation
         </strong>
         – The complete metabolic evaluation for nephrolithiasis consists of both blood and urine testing, including at least two 24-hour urine collections. In each 24-hour urine collection, the urine volume, pH, and excretion of calcium, uric acid, citrate, oxalate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and creatinine (to assess the completeness of the collection) should be measured. Also, urinary supersaturation should be calculated. Urine collections should not be performed if there is evidence of kidney/ureteral obstruction from existing stones or urinary tract infection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Complete metabolic evaluation'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Monitoring for new stones
         </strong>
         – Radiologic monitoring, usually with ultrasonography; abdominal radiography; noncontrast, low-dose CT; or digital tomosynthesis, is warranted for the detection of new stones. Monitoring should be performed initially at one year and, if negative, every two to four years thereafter depending upon the severity of the stone disease and the 24-hour urine values. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring for new stones'

         <strong>
          Asymptomatic stones
         </strong>
         – Some patients are found to have an asymptomatic kidney stone or stones by imaging performed for a different indication. Such patients may also benefit from a metabolic evaluation and appropriate medical therapy to prevent growth of any existing stones and to prevent new stone formation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with asymptomatic stones'
