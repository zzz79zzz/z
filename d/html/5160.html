Defining the optimal treatment regimens for these disorders has been difficult because of the rarity of these disorders, their highly complex clinical phenotypes, and the limited number of randomized, double-blind clinical trials [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>].</p><p>In addition, understanding of the inflammatory myopathies has evolved over the years, but disease classification schemes have not kept pace. Newer classifications, based upon histologic and serologic distinctions between the different disorders, may help define the natural history of these diseases better, may assist in the design of well-conceived randomized clinical trials, and may lead to the development of rational therapies [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p>The initial therapy of DM and PM will be reviewed here. The treatment of recurrent or resistant disease, the clinical manifestations and approach to diagnosis of these disorders in adults, the management of cutaneous manifestations of DM, and issues related to DM and PM in children are discussed separately.

Mortality rates are increased compared with individuals without inflammatory myopathy. Response rates to treatment and mortality rates are difficult to measure from the literature because of the lack of prospective controlled trials, variability in diagnostic criteria and treatment modalities over time, and lack of uniform response definitions. Nevertheless, some general conclusions can be made.</p><p>Certain demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with a poorer response to treatment and poorer outcome and include [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Older age</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulmonary involvement</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysphagia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Underlying malignancy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delay in diagnosis or initiation of treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Greater weakness at presentation</p><p></p><p>Myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies that help define certain myositis subgroups appear to also have predictive value for response to treatment [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with anti-Jo-1 antibodies and anti-synthetase syndrome often have an incomplete response to treatment and worse long-term prognosis related to the presence of associated interstitial lung disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) antibodies are associated with immune-mediated necrotizing myositis.

In patients with dermatomyositis (DM), resolution of cutaneous disease manifestations is an additional goal.</p><p>Despite the absence of placebo-controlled trials demonstrating their effectiveness, glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of initial therapy for DM and polymyositis (PM). Some clinicians also begin treatment immediately with a glucocorticoid-sparing agent, generally <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>, particularly in patients who are severely ill.

In a National Institutes of Health series, for example, 39 percent of 113 glucocorticoid-treated patients had complete normalization of serum enzymes, and 25 percent regained full muscle strength [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>The outcome of patients in community hospital settings may be better than those presumably more ill patients in tertiary care settings. As an example, in a report of 27 patients, 17 (64 percent) had little or no weakness after glucocorticoid therapy, and 11 (41 percent) achieved prolonged remissions off all medications [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">General approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians should inform patients at the start of therapy that they will be on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> in tapering doses for approximately one year, depending upon their response to therapy and achievement of disease control. Discussion of the potential side effects of glucocorticoids is essential so that patients know what to anticipate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">"Major adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids"</a>.)</p><p>There is no standard glucocorticoid regimen for treating the inflammatory myopathies, but two general principles apply:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initiation of treatment with high doses for the first several months to establish disease control</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Slow taper to the lowest effective dose for a total duration of therapy between 9 and 12 months</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Initial glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Glucocorticoid therapy in DM or PM is typically initiated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day, to a maximum daily dose of 80 mg [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Pulse <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> (1000 mg per day for three days) may be used at the start of therapy for patients who are severely ill.</p><p>For the first four to six weeks of therapy, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> is continued at 1 mg/kg per day with ongoing assessment of the clinical response. Maintenance of the prednisone dose at 1 mg/kg per day beyond six weeks may increase the risk of developing glucocorticoid myopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5171.html" rel="external">"Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Assessing treatment response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The response to glucocorticoids should be assessed every few weeks after the start of therapy. Muscle enzymes begin to decline within a few weeks of treatment and generally normalize by about six weeks. Muscle strength recovery, however, lags behind the decline in muscle enzymes, and maximal recovery of strength may not occur until three months, although this is variable. In DM, the time courses of cutaneous responses to therapy are similar: some patients respond promptly, and, in others, improvement is more delayed.</p><p>Once treatment has begun, the clinician should select several muscle groups to test on a regular basis as the primary gauge of clinical progress. It is useful to determine which muscles are the weakest for a given patient and to test these muscles sequentially over time. Since proximal muscles are typically most involved, the following muscle groups are often tested:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lower extremity:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Quadriceps – asking the patient to extend the lower leg against resistance with the limb flexed at the hip and knee</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hip flexors – asking the patient to flex the thigh against resistance with the leg flexed at the knee and hip</p><p></p><p>Proximal lower extremity strength, including the quadriceps and other muscles, may also be evaluated by asking the patient to cross his or her arms and to rise from a chair, using only the proximal leg muscles.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper extremity and neck:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Deltoids – asking the patient to abduct the arms to 90 degrees and resist the examiner pushing down on the arms</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neck flexors – asking the patient to push his or her head forward while the examiner applies reverse pressure against the forehead</p><p></p><p>Patients with respiratory muscle weakness or interstitial lung disease can be assessed with serial pulmonary function testing. It is reasonable to test at two to three months after initiating treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Glucocorticoid tapering</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to begin tapering glucocorticoids should be based on a combination of the improvement in muscle enzymes and recovery of muscle strength. Ideally, normalization of enzymes and complete recovery of muscle strength should occur before glucocorticoids are tapered, although continuation of high-dose glucocorticoids for more than six weeks may cause steroid myopathy and decline in strength. (See <a class="local">'Glucocorticoid-sparing agents'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no standard tapering regimen for the inflammatory myopathies, but regimens similar to the one outlined below are often used. Assuming that a patient begins <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> treatment at 60 mg/day and remains on this dose for six weeks, the following taper will require a total of 26 weeks to reach a daily dose of 5 mg:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> dose should be tapered by 10 mg each week until a dose of 40 mg/day is reached.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After one week on 40 mg/day, the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> dose should be tapered by 5 mg each week until the patient reaches 20 mg/day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After one week on 20 mg/day, the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> dose should be tapered by 2.5 mg each week until the patient reaches 10 mg/day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After one week on 10 mg/day, the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> dose should be tapered by 1 mg every two weeks until the patient reaches 5 mg/day.</p><p></p><p>Deviations from this regimen may be necessary if patients develop glucocorticoid myopathy or experience disease flares. Continuation of the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> taper can be considered if the patient has achieved and maintained good disease control. Tapering off prednisone completely should not proceed faster than 1 mg decreases every two weeks.</p><p>The patient should be monitored carefully during the tapering period and should be watched for signs of recurrent weakness, extramuscular complications of DM or PM, and signs of glucocorticoid toxicity. The recurrence of proximal muscle weakness in a patient treated for a prolonged period with glucocorticoids poses a significant clinical conundrum, as steroid myopathy also affects the proximal musculature. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7988.html" rel="external">"Major adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Alternate-day glucocorticoid tapers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although some clinicians use alternate-day glucocorticoid tapers for the treatment of inflammatory myopathies, there is little indication that such regimens are associated with less toxicity compared with the conventional regimen outlined above.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Glucocorticoid responses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Overall, more than 80 percent of patients with inflammatory myopathies improve with glucocorticoids alone. However, as many as 50 percent of patients with PM do not respond to glucocorticoid therapy alone [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Furthermore, among patients who do respond, the majority do not return to normal muscle strength [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Apparent glucocorticoid failures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the setting of apparent failure to respond to glucocorticoids, three possibilities should be reviewed before intensifying immunosuppression:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alternative diagnoses such as inclusion body myositis, muscular dystrophy, or hypothyroidism should be considered.

Because of the patchy nature of inflammation and the fact that inactivity may cause type 2 muscle fiber atrophy, muscle biopsy may not always help in distinguishing glucocorticoid-induced myopathy from poorly controlled myositis. The potential utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish between glucocorticoid-induced myopathy and active myositis remains undefined.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An empiric trial of lowering the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> dose and observing the muscle strength response is a practical approach to this dilemma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An unrecognized malignancy associated with myositis may be a cause of failed response to glucocorticoids.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
