         The predominant clinical consequence of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is an increased frequency and severity of infection, often opportunistic in nature, resulting in death in the first year of two of life. Several medical therapies have provided dramatic improvements in life expectancy and quality of life for patients with a primary immunodeficiency. However, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the primary curative treatment of choice for typical SCID  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139920" href="/z/d/graphic/139920.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Gene therapy is an alternative option for certain forms of SCID.
        </p>
        <p>
         The molecular pathophysiologies of most of the disorders underlying SCID are now defined  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139920" href="/z/d/graphic/139920.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), including some other gene variants associated with combined defects that may be as profound as SCID, such as cartilage-hair hypoplasia (RMRP defects) and immunodeficiency with multiple intestinal atresias (TTC7A defects)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139940" href="/z/d/graphic/139940.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). There is increasing recognition of atypical forms of SCID that are either due to hypomorphic mutations in otherwise typical SCID genes or due to mutations in genes that inherently produce a less profound immunologic defect [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Atypical SCID includes both leaky SCID, characterized by diminished, but not absent, T cell number and function, as well as Omenn syndrome, characterized by dysregulated T cells and autoimmune features [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Untreated patients with leaky SCID may live longer than patients with typical SCID. However, ultimately, they also require allogeneic HCT to prevent sequelae from opportunistic infections [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Infants with Omenn syndrome require immunosuppression and urgent HCT [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </span>
         The vast majority of SCID cases arise from mutations in genes expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or in the downstream progenitors of mature immune cells. As such, replacement of defective HSCs through allogeneic HCT permits the development of a functional immune system and may provide a complete cure for SCID [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, certain subtypes of SCID arise from genetic defects that also have effects in nonhematopoietic cells, which are not corrected by allogeneic HCT. In addition, the genetic etiology of 5 to 10 percent of SCID cases is undetermined, although whole-exome sequencing has begun to identify novel genes responsible for SCID phenotypes [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ]. Some of these unknown-genotype patients may have defects in thymus-supporting genes [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], which may be less amenable to correction via allogeneic HCT and may explain poorer survival of these patients in some series [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Genotype-specific considerations'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Gene sequencing can diagnose most cases of SCID [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,13
         </a>
         ]. In the modern era, over 90 percent of patients who proceed to HCT are genetically characterized [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Knowing whether the mutation is new (ie, sporadic) or inherited allows accurate genetic counseling and prenatal testing in the case of future pregnancies. This information permits parents to choose to terminate pregnancies that are affected or have a high risk of being affected with a particular defect. For pregnancies that are continued, in utero testing permits preparation for HCT in the early neonatal period or possibly in utero, although the last option remains highly experimental. Banking cord blood is an option for families with a known history of SCID, either for potential use in future gene therapy if the infant is affected or for future transplant of an existing or future affected sibling if the infant is unaffected.

         Survival rates for patients with SCID who undergo HCT have continued to improve due to early identification through newborn screening (NBS) or by genetic testing for a known defect when there is a family history, the availability of an increasing pool of matched unrelated donors (URDs; especially for those belonging to ethnic groups with human leukocyte antigen [HLA] types not well represented in donor banks), advances in the methods of preparing hosts and donor stem cells (especially haploidentical parental and sibling cells), and improved supportive and adjuvant therapies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14,15
         </a>
         ]. In the modern era, survival rates for patients with SCID are as high as 90 percent following HCT, with noninfected patients having survival of 95 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], though certain SCID genotypes may continue to have worse outcomes. (See

         Historical experience clearly indicates that the best outcome after HCT for SCID greatly depends upon the age at diagnosis and infection status of the patient [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,16-20
         </a>
         ]. The likelihood of post-HCT survival is improved for patients who have not yet developed any infectious complications of immunodeficiency or in whom infections have been successfully treated, although clearing infections may be challenging to accomplish in the absence of a functional immune system [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, patients transplanted within the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) had improved survival compared with those who were transplanted later (95 versus 76 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In another study, children transplanted before 3.5 months of age also had better long-term survival rates than those transplanted after that age (94 percent versus 70 percent) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Infants receiving HCT within the first 3.5 months of age also had significantly improved T cell development. A report summarized 240 infants with SCID who had undergone allogeneic HCT at multiple North American centers participating in the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC), a National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded Rare Disease Network [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Survival at five years post-HCT was high regardless of donor type among infants transplanted at ≤3.5 months of age (94 percent) and among older infants who had not yet developed infection (90 percent) or whose infections had been successfully treated (82 percent). In addition, patients identified at a very early age due to a previously affected sibling had superior outcomes [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].

         Early identification through NBS appears to play the greatest role in improving survival outcomes. In a 36-year, multicenter, longitudinal study of HCT in infants with SCID, children identified by NBS from 2010 to 2018 had a higher five-year overall survival (92.5 percent, 95% CI 85.8-96.1) compared with those identified by family history or clinical presentation during the same interval (79.9 [69.5–87.0] and 85.4 percent [71.8–92.8], respectively) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Multivariable analysis revealed that younger age and absence of active infection at the time of HCT, both of which are improved by identification through NBS, were the primary factors driving improvement in overall survival. (See

         However, early identification does not always guarantee that patients will remain infection free prior to HCT, since isolation practices differ from center to center, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) may be transmitted to the infant with SCID via breastfeeding during the first weeks of life before the diagnosis is confirmed. In addition, survival in patients with SCID diagnosed clinically following infectious presentations has improved over the years, presumably due to advances in anti-infective supportive care and transplant procedures. Furthermore, rare patients diagnosed by NBS are still at risk for death, either due to infections acquired before HCT or from HCT-related complications. (See

         One report from the PIDTC demonstrated that 42 percent of patients in North America diagnosed very early in life due to either NBS or a family history nonetheless developed at least one infection prior to transplant, with 76 percent of the infections occurring after the diagnosis was made and while awaiting HCT [

In a cohort of patients transplanted from 2010 to 2014, identification of affected SCID infants with NBS did not improve overall survival compared with patients diagnosed clinically (primarily due to the presence of an opportunistic infection), but survival of all patients was better than in previously reported cohorts [

         The selection of an optimal donor for HCT for a patient with SCID is of critical importance since the other pretransplant decisions regarding stem cell source, conditioning, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis strategies are all dependent upon the type of donor and the genotype of the patient (when known) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,23
         </a>
         ]. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related donors are preferred for HCT in patients with SCID, but most patients do not have a matched relative available [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. However, excellent survival is possible with any donor type if the HCT occurs in the first 3.5 months of life or before the onset of infection [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14,16
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Bone marrow was the original source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for HCT in patients with SCID. Stem cells can also be mobilized from bone marrow niches using agents such as the cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and then harvested from peripheral blood by apheresis. HSCs can be obtained in large numbers using this mobilization method and apheresis, but donor cells obtained in this manner typically contain a one log-higher T cell dose and are associated with higher rates of GVHD unless some form of ex vivo T cell depletion is used. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is another potential source of HSCs. (See

         SCID is unique amongst all diseases treated with HCT in that the requirement for pretransplant chemotherapy conditioning is controversial and is increasingly tailored to the specific gene defect and the type of donor. A consequence of absence of host T cells in SCID is that there is little or no resistance to incoming grafts for many SCID genotypes. Algorithms have been proposed to help guide decisions regarding conditioning [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,23
         </a>
         ]. Conditioning can be divided into agents that are mainly immunoablative (ie,

          alemtuzumab
         </a>
         ) and those that produce some degree of myeloablation or "hematopoietic stem cell space-making," depending upon the dose or exposure delivered (ie,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9173" href="/z/d/drug information/9173.html" rel="external">

          treosulfan
         </a>
         ). Peripheral blood myeloid chimerism is a surrogate marker of bone marrow stem cell engraftment. Myeloablation can be further subdivided into regimens designed to completely destroy the host's bone marrow stem cells and replace them with donor cells and those intended to produce a state of stable mixed myeloid chimerism. The latter, often referred to as reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), is expected to be less toxic in the short and long term compared with fully myeloablative regimens. In one series, survival four years after HCT was 94 percent in the RIC group compared with 58 percent in the myeloablative conditioning group [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. However, the precise amount of donor stem cells that need to engraft in the recipient's bone marrow for complete and sustained immunologic correction is not fully elucidated. The use of conditioning has resulted in better survival in some [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         ], but not all [

        </p>
        <p>
         Long-term reconstitution of B cell, as well as some aspects of T cell, immunity are influenced both by the genetic form of SCID as well as the degree of myeloid chimerism achieved by the conditioning regimens used [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,27,28
         </a>
         ]. Initial restoration of T cell function is successful for many genotypes of typical SCID without any myeloablation, regardless of donor type [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17,29
         </a>
         ]. Specifically, myeloablative chemotherapy is typically unnecessary for T cell engraftment in patients with SCID with B cells (T cell-negative, B cell-positive [T-B+] SCID) such as is seen with defects in interleukin 2 receptor gamma (IL-2RG), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), or interleukin 7 receptor (IL-7R) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, patients with SCID lacking B cells (T-B- SCID), such as is seen in patients with defects in recombination-activating gene (RAG) 1/2 or DNA cross-link repair protein 1C (DCLRE1C), have higher rates of T cell engraftment and long-term survival after some degree of myeloablation, although they are at risk for toxic effects of chemotherapy. Patients with leaky SCID and Omenn syndrome also generally require some degree of myeloablative chemotherapy to achieve multilineage engraftment [

         Acute GVHD occurs when mature T cells are not entirely removed from the donor source and "contaminate" the graft. These cells may be activated by histocompatibility differences and inflammation and can then mount a cellular immune attack against host tissues [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Use of conditioning appears to increase the risk of GVHD [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. GVHD can be minimized or prevented by processing the donor cells before infusion to remove mature T cells and by prophylactic immunosuppression following HCT. The preference for removing most mature T cells from the graft is a major distinction between stem cell transplantation for immunodeficiency and transplantation for malignancy. The antitumor effect of transferred human leukocyte antigen (HLA) incompatible mature T cells is potentially therapeutic in the setting of malignancy, while the alloreactive effect has no demonstrable benefit for patients with immunodeficiency beyond a difficult-to-measure graft-versus-marrow effect that theoretically might help achieve donor myeloid chimerism.

         HLA typing to evaluate potential donors should be performed on all available members of the patient's nuclear family as soon as a diagnosis of SCID is established. An HLA-identical sibling is the preferred donor, if available. Alternatives include a matched unrelated donor (URD), a haploidentical parent or other mismatched related donor (MMRD), or a UCB donor.

         Typically, HCT with an HLA-identical (genoidentical) sibling donor results in the most rapid and complete reconstitution of immune function in patients with SCID and carries the most favorable prognosis, with survival rates over 90 percent and approaching 100 percent in modern series [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14-17,20,30,32-34
         </a>
         ]. Thus, this is the donor of choice. However, fewer than 20 percent of patients with SCID have an HLA-identical sibling. Outside of the setting of fraternal twins, asymptomatic matched siblings are typically older than the affected patient and therefore presumably unaffected. In addition, beyond a few very rare subtypes, most cases of SCID are autosomal recessive in nature, and there is no issue with haploinsufficiency in donors. Thus, no special screening of sibling donors is needed, although some centers will perform T cell phenotyping for additional confirmation of donor suitability.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bone marrow is the preferred stem cell source with a matched sibling donor and may be infused without any processing to remove mature T cells. Pretransplant conditioning is not indicated for most patients with typical SCID receiving HLA-identical HCT from a sibling donor, although some have advocated for its use in certain genotypes, such as
         <em>
          RAG1/RAG2
         </em>
         deficiency [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14,32
         </a>
         ]. The risk of histocompatibility-associated GVHD is fairly low at approximately 25 percent for Grades II to IV and 5 percent for Grades III to IV [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,32
         </a>
         ]. Thus, some centers do not give pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis in this setting. Theoretically, a graft-versus-marrow effect occurring in the absence of chemotherapy may help achieve donor myeloid engraftment, as is noted in almost 50 percent of matched sibling donor HCTs [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, some centers elect to use short-term GVHD prophylaxis with matched sibling donors since patients who develop acute GVHD may have thymic damage that predisposes to the develop of chronic GVHD [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-37
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the question of whether to use GVHD prophylaxis for MRD HCT remains unanswered. (See

        <p>
         Some patients may also have nonsibling relatives who are HLA matched (also called a phenoidentical donor) because autosomal-recessive forms of SCID often occur in patients with constrained genetic diversity because of consanguinity or a limited ancestral population. In general, although data are sparse, it appears that outcomes are not as good in this setting as with matched sibling donors, perhaps due to differences in nontested minor histocompatibility antigens [
         <a href="#rid15">

         Another donor option is an HLA MMRD, usually a haploidentical parent [

          4,14,16,17,30,38,39
         </a>

          4,15-17,40

        <p>
         Both biologic parents have at least 50 percent identity ("haploidentical") with their offspring and may be suitable donors, although the mother is often preferred over the father because of the frequent persistence of maternally transferred lymphocytes detectable in the circulation of infants with SCID [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,41

          "HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Non-inherited maternal HLA antigens'
         </a>
         ). Because it implies a state of tolerance to maternal cells, this transplacental maternal engraftment (TME) may facilitate engraftment of additional maternal stem cells. However, in one series, TME was not associated with improved survival or less need for second transplant [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients with TME had higher rates of post-HCT acute GVHD, possibly due to the presence of subclinical GVHD prior to HCT. The use of serotherapy in the conditioning regimen partially abrogated this risk [
         <a href="#rid42">

         There is not a uniform approach to the administration of conditioning when MMRDs are used, other than as noted below for specific genotypes (see

          'Genotype-specific considerations'

         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14
         </a>
         ]. RIC regimens or immunoablative approaches are increasingly used to eliminate natural killer (NK) cells (when present) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14,38
         </a>

         The development of methods for removing mature lymphocytes, but not stem cells, from hematopoietic cell grafts was a major breakthrough, permitting the use of HLA nonidentical donors with a drastically reduced rate of GVHD.

Mature lymphocyte numbers may also be significantly decreased by positively selecting for CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells on columns that bind these cells while mature T cells and other cells are then washed away. After release from the column, CD34-enriched cells are infused into the recipient [

         A third donor option is a matched URD identified from among adult volunteers registered in the National Marrow Donor Program and other affiliated donor programs. URDs are a widely available source of HLA closely matched hematopoietic cells in the United States, particularly for White individuals. Molecular typing by DNA sequencing of histocompatibility genes, which has now replaced serologic typing, has led to better matches and a lower incidence of GVHD. (See

         Earlier surveys suggested that survival after URD HCT was lower than survival after HLA-identical sibling donor HCT. Subsequent data suggest that the survival rates are converging [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14,50
         </a>
         ]. As an example, one study reviewed 94 patients with SCID who underwent various types of HCT at two centers between 1990 and 2004. Survival rates of patients with URD HCT were slightly lower than those of patients with HLA-identical donors (81 and 92 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>

         Certain approaches may alter these survival rates. Patients in one study who received serotherapy (eg, antithymocyte globulin [ATG] or

         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. However, selection of conditioning regimen may be confounded by other patient factors, such as concurrent infections or degree of HLA matching of available donors. In addition, most studies analyze survival by time from HCT, which introduces a bias in favor of patients receiving an HCT from an HLA-matched sibling, since it takes at least an additional month from the time of SCID diagnosis to locate a URD, during which time previous infections may worsen and additional infections may develop [

          40
         </a>

The etiology of this lower survival is unclear but raises concerns that standard approaches to UCB HCT for other diseases may be suboptimal for patients with SCID and may require additional honing to make this an equally attractive option compared with MMRD or adult URD. Most patients receiving UCB HCT have received fairly intensive conditioning regimens, reflecting experience with high rejection rates in patients with other disorders undergoing this type of HCT. Careful attention to serotherapy dosing may improve UCB HCT outcomes [

         It takes at least 12 to 16 weeks to generate new T cells from donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, a few mature donor T cells derived from precommitted lymphoid progenitors may begin to appear in the circulation after approximately three to six weeks, with larger numbers developing subsequently [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. Mature T cells may appear even earlier, expanding two weeks after HCT in unconditioned infants with SCID who have received an unmanipulated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical graft from a family donor that contains mature T cells. Grafts from unrelated donors (URDs) and mismatched related donors (MMRDs) often take longer to show rising T cell numbers, probably due to the more stringent in vivo or ex vivo T cell depletion used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, these expanding mature T cells may provide some immediate immune reconstitution, even before de novo generation of T cells from donor-derived stem cells occurs.

         Thymic T cell output peaks one to two years after HCT and begins to decline thereafter. In the optimal post-HCT state, T cell reconstitution (including thymic output, clonal diversity, and T cell function) is maintained long term at levels similar or equal to normal healthy controls [

In individuals without a history of SCID, a decline in new T cell production in the thymus and in T cell function occurs progressively from birth up to age 80 years, after which age data are limited. T cell decline in transplanted patients with SCID, some of whom have now been followed for over 30 years, is often not associated with clinical deterioration or increased occurrence of infections. However, relatively few studies have assessed the very long-term durability of T cell function in patients with SCID post-HCT.

         Historically, in the absence of newborn screening (NBS), most infants with SCID had one or more pre-HCT infections, many of which were still active at the time of HCT or which may have resulted in death before HCT could be performed [

          4,14

         The most common organisms include cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus. Additional important viral pathogens include respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, enteroviruses, hepatitis viruses, and herpes simplex viruses [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. Severe diarrhea can be caused by inadvertent administration of live-attenuated rotavirus vaccine to infants with SCID [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, live polio vaccination has caused paralytic polio, and disseminated infection with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a live-attenuated mycobacterium related to
         <em>
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis
         </em>

         Active monitoring for viral infection/reactivation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is key to initiating preemptive treatment, particularly in patients with CMV or EBV infection prior to transplantation. Diagnosis by serologic testing is inappropriate since infants with SCID are unable to mount antibody responses and may have positive IgG titers reflecting maternally transferred or exogenously administered IgG.
        </p>
        <p>
         One option for treatment of some viral infections (including CMV, EBV, and adenovirus) both pre- and post-HCT is adoptive transfer of virus-reactive T cells [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64

         EBV-mediated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease is a potential serious complication of HCT.

         Graft rejection arises when sufficient immune function remains for the recipient to mount a cellular immune response against donor major and minor histocompatibility molecules. Many subtypes of SCID (such as
         <em>
          IL2RG
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          JAK3

         deficiencies) have extremely low risks of graft rejection, while others (especially leaky forms of
         <em>
          RAG1/2
         </em>
         deficiency) are fully capable of rejecting donor cells via either small numbers of residual host T cells or functional natural killer (NK) cells. Rejection may be overcome by "conditioning" the host (immunoablation) with chemotherapy to destroy immunocompetent cells and by attempting major histocompatibility matching between donor and recipient. Immunoablation with chemotherapy is preferred over irradiation in patients with primary immunodeficiency because the use of irradiation for conditioning in infants and young children is associated with a greater potential negative impact on neurocognitive development [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66

          fludarabine

         is commonly used to eliminate residual T cells but has limited effect on NK cells. When graft rejection does occur, it is typically managed with second transplant from either the original donor or a different donor [

         Significant morbidity and mortality may result from the pretransplant chemotherapy itself, especially when myeloablative agents are used. The most common myeloablative agent used in the United States is

          67

         Decreased cognitive function is a direct consequence of the genetic defect in some types of SCID. HCT does not correct associated nonhematopoietic abnormalities in primary immunodeficiencies in which expression of the defective gene is not restricted to the immune system. Thus, continued and progressive symptoms are observed posttransplant in these conditions. Examples include impaired cognitive function in patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiencies and an increased rate of deafness in ADA deficiency [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. Impaired cognition is also seen in some patients with DNA ligase 4 deficiency and nonhomologous end-joining protein 1 (Cernunnos) deficiency  (

         Improvements in overall survival and recognition that many SCID patients have significant late effects have led to questioning whether survival alone is a sufficient endpoint for studies evaluating post-HCT outcomes. One proposed endpoint is neurologic event-free survival, in which severe neurocognitive events are taken into account, although it fails to capture problems such as ongoing infections, requirement for intravenous

         Due to the rarity of the disease, patients with combined defects in their T and B cells have traditionally been lumped into the general grouping of SCID and analyzed together. However, there is increasing recognition that different genotypes of SCID  (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,20
         </a>
         ]. Historically, broad groupings have been applied. As an example, data demonstrate that mortality appears to be higher in infants with natural killer-positive (NK+) SCID compared with NK- SCID (survival rates of 62 versus 87 percent, respectively, in one series) [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60

         Patients with these genotypes have the lowest barrier to engraftment of donor cells because they typically lack both T cells and NK cells. Thus, these patients are often transplanted without any conditioning chemotherapy, regardless of donor source [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,81

These patients will typically continue to require lifelong gammaglobulin replacement if not conditioned, since the host B cells of patients with deficiencies in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain (

         Patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency are unique in that a pegylated enzyme is available for replacement, which provides at least partial removal of excess purine intermediates that are toxic to lymphocytes, thereby restoring immunity.

          83

         <a href="#rid84">
          84

          Hematopoietic cell transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency
         </strong>
         – Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only potentially curative, nonexperimental therapy available for patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139920" href="/z/d/graphic/139920.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Although trials of gene therapy for several forms of SCID have produced promising results, none are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Survival
         </strong>
         – Early diagnosis through population-wide newborn screening (NBS) and early transplantation in the absence of infectious complications appear to improve HCT outcomes. Survival rates have also continued to improve due to advances in the methods of preparing hosts and donor cells and improvements in supportive and adjuvant therapies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Factors associated with improved survival'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Genotype and pretransplant considerations
         </strong>
         – Approaches to donor choice, stem cell source, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and conditioning are increasingly driven by the underlying genotype. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pretransplant considerations'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Genotype-specific considerations'

         <strong>
          Reconstitution of immune function
         </strong>
         – Thymic T cell output is restored following HCT for SCID and peaks in one to two years. Recovery of B cell function is less consistent after HCT and does not occur in a substantial fraction of patients, especially if chemotherapy conditioning is not administered. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Reconstitution of immune function'

         </span>
         <strong>
          Complications
         </strong>
         – Complications following HCT include infections, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, graft rejection, direct organ toxicities, GVHD, and autoimmunity. The incidence of these adverse events varies with the type of HCT and underlying disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Complications before and after HCT'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Long-term prognosis
         </strong>
         – The long-term prognosis of HCT for primary immunodeficiency has improved, but challenges remain. Children with SCID post-HCT may be predisposed to decreased neurocognitive function and behavioral abnormalities. In addition, HCT does not correct associated nonhematopoietic abnormalities in primary immunodeficiencies in which expression of the defective gene is not restricted to the immune system. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Long-term prognosis'
