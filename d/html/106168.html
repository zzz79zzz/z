         Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a rare, life-threatening form of APS characterized by severe thrombotic complications, usually microvascular as well as large-vessel thrombosis, affecting multiple organs, that develop simultaneously or over a short period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         CAPS is a potentially life-threatening syndrome that requires specialized expertise and interventions such as therapeutic plasma exchange. If this expertise and capabilities are not available, the patient should be transferred urgently to a facility where they are.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of CAPS are reviewed here.

          APS

         – Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune syndrome characterized by arterial or venous thromboembolism and/or pregnancy morbidity with persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Other clinical manifestations of APS include livedo reticularis/racemosa, thrombocytopenia, neurologic changes, kidney disease, and heart valve disease (vegetations, thickening). (See

          CAPS

          Microvascular APS
         </strong>
         – Microvascular APS is not a commonly appreciated form of APS, but we use this term to refer to individuals with APS who have predominantly microvascular involvement such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, aPL-nephropathy, livedoid vasculopathy, cardiac microthrombosis, or adrenal hemorrhage/infarct [

         – Systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to a disease process in which microvascular disease leads to thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolysis (with schistocytes on the blood smear), and organ injury due to small vessel thrombosis. Several primary TMAs have been described, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), complement-mediated TMA (CM-TMA), and Shiga toxin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS).

         CAPS and APS are both thrombotic disorders associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). The role of aPL in APS is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4676.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome", section on 'Role of antiphospholipid antibodies'

        <p>
         What distinguishes CAPS from APS is the intensity and extent of the thrombotic process.
        </p>
        <p>
         CAPS, by definition, involves multiple organs simultaneously with a diffuse, micro- or combined micro- and macrovascular process. Patients with either CAPS or APS can have a stroke, or a pulmonary embolism (PE), or a kidney infarct, but patients with CAPS also have macrovascular involvement leading to thrombosis affecting other organs. In contrast, most APS patients present with a venous thromboembolism or ischemic stroke that typically does not acutely progress when treated with appropriate anticoagulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism by which a "thrombotic storm" occurs (see
         <a class="local">
          'Definitions'
         </a>
         above), rather than a single clot in one vascular bed, is not well understood. Whether individuals with CAPS have aPL with different antigen specificity, avidity, titer, or other features that differ from the aPL in APS is unknown. Based on our experience, most individuals with CAPS have triple aPL positivity with high titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies.

         An in vitro study using a modified HAM test (a type of hemolysis test) to identify complement C5b-9 deposition on the surface of test cells identified complement activation (C5b-9 deposition) in 86 percent of CAPS sera, compared with 36 percent of non-CAPS APS sera and only 7 percent of sera from individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who did not have APS [

         The same study evaluated complement regulatory genes and found that 6 of 10 CAPS patients (60 percent) had at least one pathogenic variant in one of these genes; in comparison, only 20 to 30 percent of patients with APS, SLE, or other controls had a pathogenic variant in a complement regulatory gene [
         <a href="#rid5">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Once activated, complement produces C5a, a strong inflammatory mediator, and the C5b-9 complex, which attacks cell membranes [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. C5b-9 causes hemolysis, resulting in the release of free heme that is prothrombotic. There is also damage to vascular endothelial cells that exposes subendothelial collagen and tissue factor, which can in turn activate platelets and initiate clotting. Complement attack on neutrophils may cause extrusion of DNA as NETs.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Complement dysregulation also has a pathophysiologic role in microvascular thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and acute kidney injury in complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (CM-TMA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and other "complementopathies" [

         It has been proposed that complement disorders may have a "two hit" mechanism in which the first hit (aPL or a complement gene abnormality) predisposes to complement dysregulation, and a second hit (infection, inflammation, pregnancy, surgery, or another stimulus) triggers complement-mediated cellular injury, with clinical manifestations of hemolysis and thrombosis [

         APS and CAPS represent a spectrum of clinical disorders. Initially it may not be clear whether an antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-positive individual with or without a diagnosis of APS is having isolated microvascular and/or hematologic complications of APS that will progress to a catastrophic presentation; the course may only become apparent when one or more macrovascular events has occurred. Consequently, vigilance is required to identify disease progression. Individuals who ultimately develop CAPS will typically manifest multiple thromboses, and generally, thrombocytopenia. (See

          Extent of thrombosis
         </strong>
         – CAPS is characterized by multiple thromboses occurring in different vascular beds over a relatively short period of time (days). This contrasts with APS, in which there is typically a single, large-vessel thrombotic event (or a series of events separated in time, such as an initial pulmonary embolus [PE] followed by a deep vein thrombosis [DVT] months later in association with inadequate anticoagulation). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4667.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Often in CAPS, thrombosis is microvascular as well as in large vessels. Large vessel thrombosis includes DVT in any vascular bed, PE, or arterial thrombosis (eg, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction). Isolated microvascular thrombosis in a patient with APS may not indicate CAPS, but it does suggest an increased risk of progression to CAPS and implies the need for heightened vigilance.

         A high level of suspicion for CAPS should be maintained in any patient with features of multiorgan involvement (often with evidence of ischemic changes on imaging), rapid clinical deterioration, and findings suggestive of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) such as thrombocytopenia and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, as illustrated in the figure  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A prior diagnosis of APS or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should further increase the clinical suspicion. Notably, approximately one-half of patients with CAPS do not have a known history of APS at the time of initial presentation, and the identification of APS occurs during the CAPS evaluation. (See

        </p>

         Important indicators that a patient may have CAPS rather than sepsis or a primary thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) include prior history of APS, large vessel thrombosis, and lack of known exposures associated with TMAs. (See

         Tissue biopsy is not routinely performed in clinical practice; however, biopsy may be helpful in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, provided the patient can tolerate the procedure, bleeding risk is acceptable, and awaiting the results will not unnecessarily delay treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
         If biopsy is pursued, it should focus on involved tissues and should consider potential complications, especially related to bleeding and thrombotic risks. The McMaster practice guideline suggests restricting biopsy to selected cases [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The guideline panel noted the following points: no randomized trials of biopsy have been conducted; sensitivity and specificity for CAPS is unknown; biopsy carries risks; and the results may not affect management. Tissue biopsy is included in the classification criteria for CAPS [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         A diagnosis of suspected CAPS necessitates prompt initiation of aggressive treatment; treatment should not be delayed while awaiting the results of more extensive testing. (See

          DIC

         – Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic condition involving widespread activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis that may occur in the setting of sepsis or malignancy. Like catastrophic APS, DIC may be associated with laboratory features including thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, and increased D-dimer or fibrin degradation products. Unlike CAPS, DIC is associated with an underlying systemic disorder (often infection or malignancy); and acute DIC is more likely to be associated with bleeding and increased prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

          HIT and HIT variants
         </strong>
         – Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated thrombocytopenia that occurs in the setting of heparin exposure. HIT variants including spontaneous HIT or COVID-19 VITT occur in the absence of heparin. In HIT syndromes, antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) can cause platelet activation leading to potentially fatal arterial and venous thromboses. Like CAPS, HIT can cause thrombocytopenia. Unlike aPL in CAPS, HIT antibodies are directed against PF4/heparin complexes rather than platelet phospholipids. (See

          Primary TMAs
         </strong>
         – Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are systemic syndromes (acquired or inherited) in which small vessel platelet microthrombi form in various vascular beds, leading to thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and organ injury that may be life-threatening. Primary TMAs include TTP, CM-TMA, drug-induced TMA (DITMA), Shiga toxin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS), and others. Like CAPS, TMAs may present with unexplained severe thrombocytopenia and organ involvement. Unlike CAPS, TMAs typically do not cause large vessel thromboses (and are not treated with anticoagulation), and TMAs are generally associated with specific laboratory abnormalities related to their underlying pathophysiology, such as severe ADAMTS13 deficiency in TTP.

          Vasculitis
         </strong>
         – Small-vessel vasculitis (particularly antineutrophil cytoplastic antibody [ANCA]-associated vasculitis) can manifest with multiorgan involvement (kidneys, lungs); patients may also have cutaneous lesions such as palpable purpura, petechiae, livedo reticularis, panniculitis, and ulcerations. Unlike CAPS, patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis are positive for ANCA and negative for aPL. (See

         This management discussion presumes that the diagnosis of CAPS is likely, although clinical findings are a continuum, and expert input may be required to reach that conclusion. Often, treatment decisions for suspected CAPS must be made with incomplete clinical information and revised frequently as the patient's clinical status changes or new laboratory results become available, as illustrated in the figure  (

        <p>
         Patients with suspected CAPS or other aggressive systemic thrombotic processes should be treated in a center with appropriate clinical expertise and therapeutic modalities, including the ability to do therapeutic plasma exchange. Multidisciplinary care is often necessary and may include involvement of hematology, rheumatology, nephrology, infectious disease, the intensive care team, and obstetrics when relevant. If this expertise and capabilities are not available, the patient should be transferred to a facility where they are available. Anticoagulation and glucocorticoids can be started before transfer.

        <p>
         Some treatments, especially plasma exchange, can obscure certain laboratory test results, and it is best to obtain any laboratory testing (especially antibody tests and ADAMTS13 activity) that may be helpful before these treatments are administered. (See

         The large majority of patients who are discharged from the hospital will be off glucocorticoids within a few weeks of discharge, unless they have another diagnosis requiring long-term immunosuppression.

         Similar principles apply as discussed above. Time off anticoagulation should be minimized. Although usual therapies for CAPS should be used during pregnancy, the fetus should be monitored, and delivery should be considered if the mother has refractory disease or if there is evidence of fetal injury.

         During the acute event, patients are monitored daily for clinical improvement and trends in the complete blood count (CBC) and metabolic parameters. There should be close follow-up for results of other testing to ensure that results are acted upon in a timely fashion and therapy adjusted if new information becomes available. Monitoring intervals are gradually extended as clinical status improves and continued after recovery. Monitoring the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) appears particularly predictive of disease activity, presumably because it is a marker of hemolysis. (See

          Survival

         – CAPS has a high fatality rate if not treated. Even with aggressive treatment, the mortality may exceed 30 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,27
         </a>
         ]. Early recognition and rapid initiation of appropriate therapies may improve survival. (See

          Recurrence risk
         </strong>
         – Individuals who recover from an episode of CAPS can have the disease recur. In an observational study of 58 individuals with CAPS who recovered and were followed for an average of 67 months, one-third had a relapse [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 20 percent had recurrent APS-related events, but none had another episode of multiorgan failure. Among the recurrent thromboembolic events, 40 percent occurred in a perioperative period.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The high frequency of perioperative thromboembolic events reinforces the importance of minimizing the period without anticoagulation in these individuals when they have surgery. (See

         There are no high-quality studies on prevention, but it seems likely that reducing triggers in individuals with known APS might decrease the likelihood of developing CAPS. Examples might include minimizing periods without anticoagulation, reducing procoagulant exposures such as estrogen-containing contraceptives, and treating infections rapidly. (See

          Pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a rapid-onset multiorgan syndrome with multiple vascular occlusions, often microvascular, occurring in individuals with persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), laboratory criteria for APS. A triggering factor for CAPS is often identified (infection, surgery, cancer, pregnancy, medications). Activation of complement may exacerbate thrombosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definitions'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Incidence
         </strong>
         – CAPS is rare, affecting approximately 1 percent of individuals with APS or 5 per million in the general population. Approximately one-half of individuals with CAPS have a prior known diagnosis of APS. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical findings
         </strong>
         – CAPS is not merely severe APS. Most patients have multiorgan involvement (and often multiorgan failure). Kidneys, brain, lung, and heart are most frequently affected. Large vessel thrombosis as well as microvascular involvement, with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia, are often seen. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – A high level of suspicion should be maintained in patients with multiorgan failure, MAHA, thrombocytopenia, or a history of APS, who have rapid clinical deterioration  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The evaluation focuses on identifying thrombosis, aPL, and triggering factors. The differential diagnosis includes other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and HIT variants, TMAs such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), sepsis, vasculitis, and pregnancy complications.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis is based on clinical features defined in the classification criteria  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). These criteria can support the diagnosis of definite or probable CAPS but should not take the place of clinical judgment  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Features supporting the diagnosis of CAPS rather than APS or another thrombotic disorder include rapidly progressive disease, multiorgan involvement, and a combination of large vessel and microvascular thrombosis. (See
