Anemia is correlated with poor prognosis in people with HIV, although a causal association has not been determined [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> – Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count &lt;150,000/microL. Bleeding risk is most likely to increase in individuals with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;30,000/microL), although the absolute bleeding risk depends on several factors and is difficult to predict.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neutropenia</strong> – The reference range for the absolute neutrophil count (ANC; neutrophils plus bands) depends on the individual's Duffy antigen status.

The risk of infection depends on the underlying cause of neutropenia and the ANC, with the greatest risk in individuals with bone marrow suppression and an ANC &lt;500/microL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Duffy-null</strong> - Definitions of neutropenia in Duffy-null individuals have not been well-established. Duffy-null associated neutrophil count (DANC, formerly referred to as constitutional neutropenia, benign ethnic neutropenia [BEN], or benign familial neutropenia) might be related to reduced clearance of cytokines by RBCs. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of Duffy-null individuals have an ANC &lt;1500/microL, which is not associated with an increased risk of infections. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/115286.html" rel="external">"Laboratory test reference ranges in adults", section on 'ANC (absolute neutrophil count)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/139725.html" rel="external">"Gene test interpretation: <i>ACKR1 </i>(Duffy blood group gene)", section on 'Reference ranges for Duffy-null and non-Duffy-null'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lymphopenia</strong> – Lymphopenia (also called lymphocytopenia) is generally defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt;1000 cells/microL in adults and older children; younger children may have higher lymphocyte counts.

However, cytopenias continue to occur, both as a presenting finding or during the disease or its treatment.</p><p>Case series have generally found neutropenia to be most common, followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a series of 621 people with HIV living in Seoul, South Korea from 2005 to 2010 who had not started ART, after exclusion of 149 individuals with known conditions other than HIV that could cause cytopenias, the following frequencies were noted [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lymphopenia – 26 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neutropenia – 10 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anemia – 3 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Thrombocytopenia – 2.4 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The median CD4 count before ART was 300/microL. Treatment with ART reversed the cytopenias in most cases (84 percent of lymphopenias, 91 percent of neutropenias, 85 percent of anemias, and <strong>all</strong> thrombocytopenias).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A series of 1571 people with HIV living in a number of countries in Africa, Asia, and the Americas with CD4 cell counts &lt;300/microL who were evaluated between 2005 and 2007 and who had not started ART found the following frequencies of cytopenias [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neutropenia – 14 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anemia – 12 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Thrombocytopenia – 7 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Approximately 5 percent had more than one cytopenia (mostly bi-cytopenias). Cytopenias were somewhat less common in the Americas compared with Africa and Asia, but there was significant heterogeneity across countries.</p><p></p><p>Data regarding specific cytopenias include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anemia</strong> – Anemia may be more common in certain populations. In the pre-ART era, anemia was common in individuals with AIDS (as many as 70 percent in one early series) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In a study of 400 people with HIV living in Uganda who were not receiving long-term ART, nearly one-half had anemia [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In a series of 905 adults in the Johns Hopkins Clinic Cohort from 2002, 27 percent had a hemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL, and an additional 11 percent had a hemoglobin level &lt;10 g/dL [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Institution of ART resulted in a hemoglobin level above 12 g/dL in 83 percent, suggesting that the anemia was due to HIV or an opportunistic infection that resolved with ART. The frequency of anemia has declined, but mild anemia (eg, hemoglobin in the 10 to 12 g/dL range) remains common [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> – Thrombocytopenia is often seen as a sentinel event in HIV infection:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In one early series of patients with AIDS published in 1982 (the pre-ART era), thrombocytopenia was noted in 40 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a case-control study from the ART era (2009) that included 73 people with HIV who had platelet counts &lt;100,000/microL and 73 people with HIV who had normal platelet counts, risk factors for thrombocytopenia included HIV RNA &gt;400 copies/mL, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 5.3, 6.1, and 24, respectively) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The individuals with thrombocytopenia were more likely to have major bleeding than controls (18 versus 3 percent; OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.5-29). There were no fatal bleeding events, but thrombocytopenia was correlated with death from other causes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a systematic review from 2011 that evaluated participants in the Collaborations in HIV Outcomes Research/US (CHORUS) cohort from 1997 to 2006 and participants in HIV clinical trials from 1996 to 2004, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia was approximately 14 percent in both cohorts [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 2012 publication from the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS reported that in the ART era, thrombocytopenia was only diagnosed in 0.6 percent of 5290 people living with HIV [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Unexplained thrombocytopenia has been identified as an indicator condition that should trigger testing for HIV [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>]. Data from a large European cohort obtained between 2009 and 2011 demonstrated a 3.2 percent prevalence of HIV infection among individuals presenting with unexplained thrombocytopenia or leukopenia lasting for more than four weeks [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Thrombocytopenia due to direct effects of HIV or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) typically resolves within one to five months of starting ART. (See <a class="local">'Mechanisms'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neutropenia</strong> – In a longitudinal study from 2016 in over 370,000 individuals in a primary care practice, HIV was one of the more common causes of neutropenia, accounting for 30 of 188 cases (16 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Unexplained leukopenia (low white blood cell count), which is usually due to neutropenia, has been identified as an indicator condition that should trigger HIV testing [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bi-cytopenias or pancytopenia</strong> – Case reports have described presentations in people with HIV, including various combined cytopenias or pancytopenia, which may be due to several conditions including primary HIV infection, opportunistic infections, thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or a hematologic malignancy. (See <a class="local">'Clinical case vignettes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4082688751"><span class="h2">Mechanisms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HIV can infect hematopoietic stem cells and can impair production of any hematopoietic lineage (lymphocytes, granulocytes, red blood cells, or platelets) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. HIV can also suppress the bone marrow via production of proinflammatory cytokines that block hematopoiesis [<a href="#rid7">7,14</a>]. Underlying causes are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120334" href="/d/graphic/120334.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Opportunistic infections due to HIV-induced immunosuppression can also affect developing blood cells, either directly or via cytokine upregulation. In the epidemiologic study involving people with HIV living in Korea who had not yet started treatment (see <a class="local">'Prevalence in untreated patients'</a> above), over 90 percent of the cytopenias resolved with institution of combination ART [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Autoimmune mechanisms (immune thrombocytopenia [ITP], autoimmune hemolytic anemia [AIHA], autoimmune neutropenia) and vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency are other common causes of cytopenias [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In an otherwise well individual with thrombocytopenia as the presenting finding of HIV, thrombocytopenia is often mediated by autoantibodies or direct effects of HIV on the bone marrow, and the institution of ART is likely to resolve the thrombocytopenia or at least raise the platelet count into a safe range to reduce the risk of bleeding. In a systematic review from 2011, the time to improvement in platelet count varied from approximately one month in the clinical trials group to approximately five months in the CHORUS cohort [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Occult or overt liver disease, such as from concomitant viral hepatitis or steatohepatitis, may cause mild cytopenias due to hypersplenism; thrombocytopenia may also be due to reduced thrombopoietin levels in severe liver disease. (See <a class="local">'Thrombocytopenia'</a> below.)</p><p>Drug-induced cytopenias can also occur in people with HIV, often due to antibiotics or cancer chemotherapy. There are several potential mechanisms, including immune reactions, bone marrow toxicity, or oxidant injury, especially in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In contrast to antibiotics and chemotherapy, drug-induced cytopenias due to combination ART are uncommon. This differs from the early HIV/AIDS epidemic, when several cytopenias were commonly caused by early antiretroviral therapies such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1510786228"><span class="h1">ILL/SYMPTOMATIC PATIENT; CD4 CELL COUNT &lt;200/microL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are numerous potential causes of cytopenias in individuals with low CD4 counts. Typically, a CD4 count &lt;200 cells/microL is used as a marker to indicate increased risk of opportunistic infections, but there is no absolute cutoff, and different infections become more likely at different CD4 cell counts depending on whether the HIV virus is effectively suppressed by antiretroviral therapy (ART), as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3747.html" rel="external">"Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2524978547"><span class="h2">Rapid evaluation for acutely ill/symptomatic patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation in an acutely ill or symptomatic patient with a low CD4 cell count (&lt;200/microL) and one or more cytopenias focuses on identifying life-threatening opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other rare disorders. </p><p>Individuals with fever and/or severe reductions in cell counts may warrant ferritin testing (for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [HLH]) as well as urgent hematology evaluation with review of the blood smear and possible bone marrow testing for malignancy, opportunistic infections, and hemophagocytosis.

The incidence of most OIs is greatest in individuals with CD4 cell counts &lt;200/microL (&lt;100/microL for certain fungal and mycobacterial infections) [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. However, the risk of developing an OI is markedly reduced if the patient's viral load is suppressed by ART, even if the CD4 cell count is &lt;200 cells/microL.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Testing for localized or disseminated bacterial and other infections is appropriate for most patients who present with a fever and cytopenias.

HIV testing was positive, and her CD4 cell count was low (20 cells/microL; reference range, 800 to 1050 cells/microL). A presumptive diagnosis of HIV-associated immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) was made and treatment with ART and intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) was initiated, followed by glucocorticoids for four weeks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, her platelet count did not increase, and a bone marrow examination was performed. The aspirate was a "dry tap"; the biopsy showed abundant mycobacteria, consistent with <em>M. avium</em> complex (MAC). Her platelet count improved to 30,000/microL within two weeks of starting ART and to 150,000/microL within three weeks. This case emphasizes the possibility of an opportunistic infection in an individual with what appeared to be an isolated cytopenia, as well as the value of performing a bone marrow examination in an individual with presumed ITP that did not respond to ITP therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Histoplasmosis presenting as anemia, thrombocytopenia and AKI (patient with known HIV)</strong> – A case report described a 35-year-old woman with recently diagnosed HIV infection who had not yet started ART and presented to the emergency department with fever, vomiting, and diarrhea [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. She resided in a region of the United States where histoplasmosis is endemic. Her initial hemoglobin was low (8 g/dL) with a normal white blood cell count (7000/microL) and platelet count (220,000/microL) and a high creatinine (9 mg/dL). There were no schistocytes on her blood smear. Her creatinine two weeks earlier was 1.2 mg/dL, and she had not been started on any new medications. Her CD4 cell count was low (19 cells/microL) and viral load was high (1 million copies/mL). Urinalysis was positive for white blood cells and leukocyte esterase, and she was started on antibiotic therapy for a presumptive diagnosis of pyelonephritis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">She remained febrile and her platelet count declined to 26,000/microL on hospital day 3. Blood Gram stain showed intracellular yeast forms, and fungal culture and urine histoplasma antigen testing confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. She improved with antifungal therapy (amphotericin) and was discharged with a normal creatinine and platelet count. This case emphasizes the broad differential diagnosis in an acutely ill person with HIV who has fever and more than one cytopenia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ITP (patient with known HIV on ART)</strong> – A case report described a 13-year-old female who was diagnosed with HIV infection two years prior, when she presented with mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 90,000/microL) and failure to thrive [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. The infection was thought to have been transmitted antenatally, as the mother had received blood transfusions during pregnancy. She was treated with zidovudine-containing ART with an initial normalization of her platelet count followed by more severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 22,000/microL) with epistaxis. Bone marrow examination revealed large megakaryocytes, consistent with ITP. Her platelet count normalized with a course of glucocorticoids that was eventually tapered (ART was continued) and her platelet count remained in the normal range. This case illustrates the use of ART for HIV-associated ITP, as well as occasional need for ITP-specific medications in selected individuals with severe thrombocytopenia and/or bleeding. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> is an option if a more rapid improvement is needed, and platelet transfusions can be given if there is clinically significant bleeding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Parvovirus (patient with</strong> <strong>known HIV and intermittent adherence to ART)</strong> – A case report described a 15-year-old male diagnosed with HIV eight years prior who had intermittently poor ART adherence and who presented with severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.1 g/dL) [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. His anemia was normocytic and normochromic; his reticulocyte count was inappropriately low; his CD4 cell count was 98/microL; and his viral load was 5210 copies/mL). Serologies for hepatitis and parvovirus were negative. He was treated with transfusions, and ART was reinitiated, which led to improvement in his hemoglobin level. He subsequently re-presented with severe anemia, and bone marrow showed absence of maturing red blood cells beyond the pronormoblast stage, a classic finding in parvovirus infection. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on serum for parvovirus was positive. Reinstitution of ART and treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> resulted in normalization of the hemoglobin. This case emphasizes the possibility of parvovirus in an individual with isolated severe anemia with a low reticulocyte count, the use of viral PCR and bone marrow to make the diagnosis, the efficacy of ART, and the use of transfusions and IVIG in a case with severe anemia.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2212769517"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

However, cytopenias continue to occur, both as a presenting finding or during the disease or its treatment. Mechanisms include direct effects of HIV on hematopoietic stem cells, effects of cytokines, autoimmune destruction, liver disease/hypersplenism, and medications; cytopenias related to combination ART are uncommon  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120334" href="/d/graphic/120334.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'General concepts'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acutely ill/symptomatic patient</strong> – The evaluation in an acutely ill or symptomatic patient with a low CD4 count focuses on identifying life-threatening opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other rare disorders such as thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and human herpes virus 8 (HHV8)-associated disorders. Urgent hematology evaluation with review of the blood smear is usually appropriate. The threshold for bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is low, but this may be omitted in selected circumstances as outlined above. (See <a class="local">'Rapid evaluation for acutely ill/symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antibiotics</strong> – Fever and neutropenia is generally treated with antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In some cases, antibiotics may be started as an outpatient or discontinued following negative culture results. Acutely ill individuals with thrombocytopenia may be treated for infection or a TMA if indicated. (See <a class="local">'Immediate interventions in the acute setting'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88648.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medication review</strong> – In a stable or asymptomatic individual, potential causes of cytopenias depend on whether the individual is receiving ART; if not, initiation of ART is appropriate and may lead to resolution of the cytopenia(s). Other considerations include causes unrelated to HIV that are seen in the general population. (See <a class="local">'Stable or asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Therapy</strong> – The role of specific interventions such as transfusions, erythropoietin, therapies for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and G-CSF are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Indications for transfusion and erythropoietin'</a> above and <a class="local">'Interventions for bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia'</a> above and <a class="local">'Role of G-CSF'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Example cases</strong> – Some of the important aspects of diagnosing and treating cytopenias are illustrated in a series case vignettes.
