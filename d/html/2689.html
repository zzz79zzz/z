In resource-abundant settings, many diarrheal pathogens are transmitted through contaminated food or water, sometimes resulting in outbreaks with several or multiple affected individuals. The infectious etiologies of acute diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich countries will be reviewed here. </p><p>The approach to evaluation and management of acute diarrhea in adults and children in resource-abundant settings is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2717.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-abundant settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6456.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p>The approach to acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings is also discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13954.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13956.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1823851406"><span class="h1">CLINICAL CLUES TO THE MICROBIAL CAUSE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with acute diarrhea or other foodborne illness, the precise causative pathogen cannot be reliably distinguished based on clinical presentation alone. However, there are certain features that raise the probability of certain pathogens over others  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The specific clinical manifestations</strong> – Among patients presenting with acute diarrhea, the most likely causative pathogens differ between watery diarrhea, in which small bowel pathogens predominate, and inflammatory diarrhea (with fever and bloody or mucoid stool), in which large bowel pathogens predominate. (See <a class="local">'Watery diarrhea'</a> below and <a class="local">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most foodborne infections will typically manifest as a mixture of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. With certain pathogens, vomiting rather than diarrhea may predominate (see <a class="local">'Vomiting'</a> below). Furthermore, some foodborne diseases are characterized by non-gastrointestinal symptoms that can be distinctive and suggestive of the cause. Examples include botulism, ciguatera fish poisoning or scombroid, and <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> central nervous system infection. (See <a class="local">'Non-gastrointestinal syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The type of exposure</strong> – For patients with diarrhea or other suspected foodborne illness, identifying the particular food exposure can potentially suggest certain pathogens, particularly if the illness is occurring in the setting of an outbreak connected to a known food source  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58714" href="/d/graphic/58714.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Not all cases of acute diarrhea are food- or waterborne. Other important exposures include animal contact, travel to resource-limited settings, occupation (eg, in daycare centers), and recent antibiotic use or health care exposures. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The time to onset</strong> – For suspected foodborne illness, the timing of symptom onset following exposure to the suspect food can be informative. Ingested preformed toxins (eg, those produced by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Bacillus cereus</em>) cause illness within hours of exposure, whereas ingested pathogens that subsequently produce toxin (eg, enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>) or directly damage or invade across the intestinal epithelial cell wall (eg, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Shigella</em>) usually result in symptoms after approximately 24 hours or longer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Protozoal pathogens (eg, <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>) generally produce enteric illness after an incubation period of approximately seven days.</p><p></p><p>Details on the evaluation of patients with acute diarrhea and indications for testing to identify the microbiologic cause are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2717.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H670770239"><span class="h1">DIARRHEA</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Burden of disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute infectious diarrhea in resource-abundant countries is very common, although the overall burden has not been as well studied as in resource-limited settings. Population-based studies suggest an incidence range of 0.7-1.4 illnesses/person/year in the United States, depending on the symptom profile [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. </p><p>Insight into the burden of foodborne illnesses has also been provided by analysis of outbreaks reported to public health institutions During 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified 22,019 infections, 5,359 hospitalizations, and 153 deaths due to foodborne disease in the United States [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3970604294"><span class="h2">Overview of causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infectious or noninfectious causes may be responsible for acute diarrhea and, in selected patients, both can occur simultaneously. Among infectious causes, a wide variety of pathogens cause acute diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-abundant settings. </p><p>Infectious diarrheal diseases may be categorized by the portion of the intestine that they are prone to infect, since the presenting symptoms vary by region of the intestine involved in disease; this, in turn, can suggest involvement of particular pathogens [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Small bowel</strong> – The small bowel functions as a fluid- and enzyme-secretory and nutrient-absorbing organ. Dysregulation of these two processes due to infections of the small bowel leads to a watery diarrhea that occurs in large volume and is associated with abdominal cramping, bloating, gas, and weight loss [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. For the most part, when only small bowel is involved, fever is rarely a significant symptom, and the stool does not contain occult blood or inflammatory cells. Enteric viruses (and specifically norovirus) are the most common causes of watery diarrhea  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Watery diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Large bowel</strong> – The main function of the large bowel is to absorb fluid and salt and to excrete potassium. Thus, large intestinal diarrheas present with frequent, regular, small-volume, often painful bowel movements. Fever and bloody or mucoid stools are common, and red blood cells and inflammatory cells can be seen routinely on the stool smear. Bacterial pathogens are more common causes of inflammatory, large intestinal diarrhea  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2200733743"><span class="h3">Most common causes overall</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The causes of infectious diarrhea vary from region to region, from rural to urban settings, and depending on co-morbidities, such as HIV or other immune-compromising conditions. </p><p>In the United States between 2009 and 2013, the microbiologic cause was unknown in 31 percent of outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis transmitted by person-to-person spread [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. When active surveillance is performed, norovirus has been identified as the most common cause of medically attended acute GI illness in the United States [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1">The CDC's Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) monitors cases of enteric organisms; the three leading pathogens in 2016 to 2018 were <em>Campylobacter</em>, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em>; Listeria was associated with the highest mortality [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p>Relative frequencies of bacterial and parasitic pathogens are generally comparable in resource-abundant settings, with some exceptions. In a prospective study of acute gastroenteritis in the United Kingdom, the most common bacterial isolate was <em>Campylobacter</em>, in 4.6 and 13 percent of community and general practice cases, respectively [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. <em>Salmonella</em>, enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Yersinia</em>, <em>Listeria</em>, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Cyclospora</em> were uncommon; each was identified in less than 1 percent of overall cases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4226996491"><span class="h3">Severe or bloody diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bacteria are more likely pathogens in cases of severe or bloody diarrhea compared with milder watery diarrhea [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. </p><p>This was illustrated in a study of 173 healthy adults with severe acute community-acquired diarrhea (defined as ≥4 fluid stools per day for more than three days); a bacterial pathogen was identified in 87 percent of cases [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], much more frequently than seen with acute diarrhea in general. (See <a class="local">'Most common causes overall'</a> above.)</p><p>With bloody diarrhea, the likelihood of particular bacteria, including <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7, is also higher. In a prospective study that evaluated approximately 550 episodes of reported bloody diarrhea for which stool cultures were obtained, a bacterial pathogen was identified in 31 percent of specimens [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. <em>Shigella</em> was the most common isolate (49 percent), followed by <em>Campylobacter</em> (20 percent), <em>Salmonella</em> (19 percent), and <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 (8 percent). In an earlier study that included approximately 900 visibly bloody stool specimens, <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 accounted for 39 percent of cultured isolates from visibly bloody specimens but only 7 percent of cultured isolates from all stools (bloody and nonbloody). Bloody diarrhea was much less common in patients with culture-negative diarrhea. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3949334766"><span class="h3">Outbreaks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outbreaks of diarrheal illnesses are most often related to food sources but can also be associated with animal contacts and recreational water exposure (eg, swimming or wading pools). In the United States between 2009 to 2013, more than 10,000 outbreaks of gastroenteritis occurred due to presumed person-to-person spread or environmental contamination [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The most frequently implicated foods in 120 multistate foodborne outbreaks in the United States between 2010 to 2014 included fruits, vegetable row crops, beef, sprouts, and seeded vegetables [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Ill food handlers are also important sources for foodborne outbreaks, particularly due to norovirus and other pathogens easily transmitted by person-to-person contact [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p>Waterborne outbreaks associated with recreational water exposure (eg, swimming or wading pools) are another source of acute diarrhea and commonly involve other pathogens. They have been associated most frequently with <em>Cryptosporidium</em> (50 percent) with treated water sources and with toxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (25 percent) and norovirus (25 percent) with freshwater sources [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H139241034"><span class="h3">Noninfectious causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea include drug adverse effects, food allergies, primary gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, and other disease states, such as thyrotoxicosis and the carcinoid syndrome. (See appropriate topic reviews for more details.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H898566633"><span class="h2">Watery diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many pathogens can cause watery diarrhea (usually of large volume and associated with abdominal bloating, without fever or bloody stools). In resource-abundant countries, the most common causes are enteric viruses, specifically norovirus  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> (which is also associated with inflammatory diarrhea), <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (ETEC), <em>Giardia lamblia, </em>and <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em> are also important pathogens. </p><p>Pathogens that are more classically associated with inflammatory diarrhea can also cause watery diarrhea, particularly early in the course of infection. (See <a class="local">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2995510370"><span class="h3">Norovirus and other enteric viruses</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Norovirus</strong> – Norovirus (also known as Norwalk-like virus) is the leading cause of medically attended acute gastroenteritis in the United Status [<a href="#rid11">11,20</a>]. Norovirus has a low infectious dose (around 10 particles) and can be readily transmitted from the vomitus and the stool of an infected person (including through contaminated prepared food). Norovirus may also be transmitted in aerosol form or via person-to-person contact [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Noroviruses are responsible for the epidemic form of family- and community-wide outbreaks of acute explosive vomiting and diarrhea. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Symptoms generally begin 24 to 48 hours after exposure and last for 48 to 72 hours. Recovery is rapid and full but does not result in long-lasting immunity. If needed for public health reasons or in the case of severe infection, diagnosis can be made by antigen detection through enzyme immunoassay or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2710.html" rel="external">"Norovirus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other viruses</strong> – Rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses (eg, adenovirus serotypes 40 and 41), astrovirus, and sapovirus predominantly cause infection in children. In adults, diarrhea associated with these viruses has been described mainly in immunocompromised or institutionalized patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5984.html" rel="external">"Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-abundant countries: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1646699013"><span class="h3">Clostridioides difficile</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>C. difficile</em>-associated diarrhea is one of the most common hospital-associated infections. It is typically associated with recent antibiotic use. However, severe cases have also been described in patients classically considered at low risk, including healthy individuals in the community without those traditional risk factors and peripartum women [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Clinicians should thus consider the diagnosis of <em>C. difficile </em>infection in all patients with severe diarrhea. <em>C. difficile </em>can sometimes be associated with inflammatory diarrhea (with fever and bloody or mucoid diarrhea) as well. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of <em>C. difficile</em> are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2696.html" rel="external">"<i>Clostridioides difficile </i>infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2699.html" rel="external">"<i>Clostridioides difficile </i>infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2698.html" rel="external">"<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection in adults: Treatment and prevention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2844962916"><span class="h3">Clostridium perfringens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>C. perfringens</em> is an important cause of foodborne, toxin-mediated watery diarrhea in resource-abundant settings. In the United States, it is thought to be the second most common cause of foodborne bacterial infection (behind nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella </em>spp), with an estimated one million illnesses each year [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, <em>C. perfringens</em> is less frequently reported as a cause of outbreaks since symptoms are relatively mild, and testing is not routinely performed.</p><p>Type A strains cause typical foodborne outbreaks. <em>C. perfringens</em> spores can survive normal cooking temperatures and can germinate and proliferate in foods that are improperly stored. Outbreaks are most commonly associated with inadequately heated or reheated meats, poultry, or gravy [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Following ingestion of a large quantity of organisms with the food, <em>C. perfringens</em> releases an enterotoxin in the gastrointestinal tract resulting in watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Vomiting and fever can occur but are uncommon. The incubation period ranges from 6 to 24 hours (usually 10 to 12 hours) and symptoms generally resolve within 24 to 48 hours. Restaurants and catering facilities are the most frequent food sources; outbreaks occur year-round, with a median size of approximately 20 individuals [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Outbreaks have also been described in inpatient psychiatric facilities; it has been postulated that antipsychotic (and other) medications impair intestinal mobility and increase susceptibility to infection [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. </p><p><em>C. perfringens</em>-associated diarrhea should be suspected in single-source outbreaks that involve improperly cooked or stored meat. Both stool and food should be tested for the bacteria and the toxin. These tests are generally performed at reference laboratories. Infection is confirmed with a positive stool culture (ie, growth of at least 10<sup>6 </sup>colony-forming units [CFU] <em>C. perfringens</em> per gram). <em>C. perfringens</em> can be confirmed as the source of an outbreak when stool cultures are positive from at least two affected individuals, when enterotoxin is detected in stool from at least two affected individuals, or when culture of the suspect food source grows at least 10<sup>5</sup> CFU <em>C. perfringens</em> per gram [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>Supportive care, including oral or intravenous hydration, is warranted to prevent or treat volume depletion, but antibiotic treatment is unnecessary, as the infection is characteristically self-limited.</p><p>Type C strains produces a beta toxin, which can cause hemorrhagic necrosis of the jejunum, called enteritis necroticans or pigbel. Pigbel usually occurs in resource-limited countries (particularly Papua New Guinea) following pork consumption, but has been rarely described in the United States (in association with consumption of pig intestines [chitterlings]) and other resource-abundant settings [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. The simultaneous ingestion of sweet potatoes, which contain trypsin inhibitors preventing the intestinal degradation of the toxin, may be a potentiating factor. Pigbel is characterized by abdominal distention and pain, with dilated thickened loops of bowel with segmental necrosis. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H201977218"><span class="h3">Enterotoxigenic E. coli</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (ETEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in resource-limited settings, and thus is associated with travelers' diarrhea in resource-abundant countries. It is not thought to be a common cause of domestically acquired diarrhea in resource-abundant settings, but it has been linked to sporadic outbreaks of diarrhea in the United States [<a href="#rid30">30</a>] and has also become a common pathogen in cruise ship diarrhea outbreaks [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

For most patients, the precise causative pathogen cannot be reliably distinguished based on clinical presentation alone. However, certain clinical features raise the likelihood of certain pathogens over others. These features include the precise clinical manifestations (watery versus inflammatory diarrhea or extra-intestinal manifestations)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097" href="/d/graphic/116097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and the exposure history  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58714" href="/d/graphic/58714.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Clinical clues to the microbial cause'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Causes</strong> – The causes of infectious diarrhea vary from region to region, from rural to urban settings, and depending on co-morbidities, such as HIV or other immune-compromising conditions. In general, however, most cases of acute infectious diarrhea are caused by viruses, in particular norovirus. Bacteria are more likely pathogens in cases of severe or bloody diarrhea. <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em> are the generally the most common bacterial causes. (See <a class="local">'Overview of causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Watery diarrhea</strong> – Other than norovirus, important causes of watery diarrhea include <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>, enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC), and <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>. The clinical presentation of <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> ranges from watery to more inflammatory diarrhea. (See <a class="local">'Watery diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inflammatory diarrhea</strong> – Other than <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em>, important causes of inflammatory diarrhea (characterized by fever, severe abdominal pain, and bloody or mucoid diarrhea) include <em>Shigella</em>, enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em>, and <em>Yersinia</em>. (See <a class="local">'Inflammatory diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vomiting</strong> – The sudden onset of nausea and vomiting is likely due to the ingestion of a preformed toxin, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> enterotoxin or <em>Bacillus cereus</em> emetic toxin, or a chemical irritant. Viral gastroenteritis also often presents with vomiting as the predominant symptom. (See <a class="local">'Vomiting'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Non-gastrointestinal syndromes</strong> – Some foodborne pathogens cause serious illness but are not predominantly associated with gastrointestinal disease. Important examples include botulism, ciguatera or other toxin poisoning, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> bacteremia or central nervous system infection, scombroid, and hepatitis A virus infection. (See <a class="local">'Non-gastrointestinal syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1291939987"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The editorial staff at UpToDate acknowledge Christine Wanke, MD, and David Acheson, MD, FRCP, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Chai SJ, Gu W, O'Connor KA, et al.
