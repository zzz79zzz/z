Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency are collectively referred to as central adrenal insufficiency. Once cortisol deficiency is confirmed, the next step is to determine the level of the defect leading to adrenal insufficiency in order to narrow the differential etiology and inform subsequent diagnostic testing. Establishing the etiology of adrenal insufficiency is important because it may be due to a disease that has other clinical ramifications, such as tuberculosis or an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (in primary adrenal insufficiency) or a pituitary tumor (in secondary adrenal insufficiency). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/173.html" rel="external">"Causes of secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency in adults"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the diagnostic steps needed to establish the specific etiology of adrenal insufficiency. The presentation of adrenal insufficiency and the diagnosis of cortisol deficiency are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/157.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1466463358"><span class="h1">ESTABLISH THE LEVEL OF DEFECT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once cortisol deficiency is established, we next determine if the defect localizes to the adrenal gland (primary adrenal insufficiency) or the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency, respectively). The diagnosis of cortisol deficiency, including basal and stimulated cortisol testing, is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/157.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Basal serum cortisol testing'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/157.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'ACTH stimulation tests'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3149078450"><span class="h2">ACTH measurement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The plasma corticotropin (ACTH) level can help distinguish between primary and central (ie, secondary or tertiary) adrenal insufficiency  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141555" data-inline-graphics="141555" href="/z/d/graphic/141555.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). It can be measured with an early morning serum cortisol (ie, by 8 AM) as part of the initial evaluation for adrenal insufficiency. Alternatively, ACTH can be measured later in the evaluation after cortisol deficiency is confirmed; in this case, we remeasure an early morning cortisol level with the ACTH level to verify cortisol deficiency and help interpret the ACTH value [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/157.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Basal serum cortisol testing'</a>.)</p><p>Proper specimen collection and handling are critical for ACTH measurement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/171.html" rel="external">"Measurement of ACTH, CRH, and other hypothalamic and pituitary peptides", section on 'Pitfalls in measurement'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ACTH measurement prior to glucocorticoid therapy (optimal)</strong> – Ideally, blood samples for ACTH measurement are drawn before initiating glucocorticoid therapy because exogenous glucocorticoids can suppress ACTH secretion. When establishing the cause of adrenal insufficiency is not urgent (eg, patients with chronic, mild signs and symptoms), treatment decisions may be delayed until diagnostic testing is complete. However, in the setting of moderate to severe signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or possible adrenal crisis, diagnostic testing should never delay treatment initiation. In such patients, obtaining both an ACTH and cortisol level as part of the initial evaluation is useful. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Adrenal crisis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/155.html" rel="external">"Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Adrenal crisis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>If glucocorticoid therapy has already been started at a physiologic replacement dose</strong> – In patients already receiving physiologic glucocorticoid therapy, blood samples should be drawn prior to the morning dose of a short-acting (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">hydrocortisone</a>) or longer-acting (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>) glucocorticoid, assuming that short-acting agents are taken two or three times daily and longer-acting agents are taken once daily in the morning.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>If glucocorticoid therapy has already been started</strong> <strong>at a supraphysiologic dose</strong> – High glucocorticoid doses (eg, initiated for possible adrenal crisis) suppress ACTH levels acutely. If supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy is given for more than two weeks, ACTH may remain suppressed after the glucocorticoid is discontinued, possibly leading to misdiagnosis of endogenous central adrenal insufficiency. In this setting, ACTH and cortisol levels should be measured at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoid as an initial screening test; retesting is often required if cortisol is suppressed, particularly after exposure to supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses for at least six weeks.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1553192344"><span class="h2">ACTH interpretation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the sample is drawn in the proper setting and the corticotropin (ACTH) assay is reliable, then the plasma ACTH measurement by itself is usually sufficient to discern whether the adrenal insufficiency is primary or central  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141555" href="/z/d/graphic/141555.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. For most assays, the normal range for ACTH values at 8 AM is between approximately 10 and 65 pg/mL (2 and 14 pmol/L) in a two-site chemiluminescent assay.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ACTH above the reference range</strong> – In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH concentration above the upper limit of the reference range indicates primary adrenal insufficiency. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, cortisol production is deficient, and the loss of cortisol-mediated negative feedback inhibition leads to increased ACTH secretion. In primary adrenal insufficiency, the early morning plasma ACTH concentration is high, usually &gt;2-fold the upper limit of the reference range and sometimes reaching or even exceeding 4000 pg/mL (880 pmol/L) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. If the ACTH level is elevated, the next step is to determine the underlying cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation for the cause of primary adrenal insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ACTH below or in the lower half of the reference range</strong> – In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a low (or inappropriately normal) plasma ACTH concentration (eg, less than approximately 35 pg/mL [8 pmol/L] in most assays) indicates central (ie, secondary or tertiary) adrenal insufficiency. Patients with central adrenal insufficiency have intrinsically normal adrenal glands that fail to produce cortisol because pituitary ACTH secretion is deficient. Although the ACTH concentration may not be overtly low in central adrenal insufficiency, it is usually in the lower half of the reference range and inappropriately low in the setting of cortisol deficiency. If the ACTH level indicates central adrenal insufficiency, the next step is to determine the underlying etiology. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation for the cause of central adrenal insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ACTH in the upper half of the reference range</strong> – In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, an ACTH value in the upper half of the reference range (eg, between approximately 35 to 65 pg/mL [8 to 14 pmol/L] for most assays) is considered indeterminate for establishing the level of the defect and may reflect either evolving primary adrenal insufficiency or partial central adrenal insufficiency. In individuals with cortisol deficiency and recent exposure to supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy, an ACTH in the upper half of the reference range or higher likely reflects primary adrenal insufficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients in whom the ACTH level is indeterminate, measurement of plasma aldosterone and renin levels and serum electrolytes may help distinguish between primary and central adrenal insufficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Low aldosterone with elevated renin</strong> – A low plasma aldosterone level with an elevated renin level is consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency, a condition that results in mineralocorticoid as well as cortisol deficiency. In the early evolution of primary adrenal insufficiency due to autoimmune adrenalitis, mineralocorticoid deficiency may be more pronounced than cortisol deficiency; therefore, a low aldosterone and elevated renin level can precede overt elevation in ACTH [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, aldosterone levels are usually low, often in association with hyperkalemia, and provide insufficient mineralocorticoid activity to suppress renin production. If mineralocorticoid deficiency is evident, we next evaluate for the underlying cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2314.html" rel="external">"Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency"</a> and <a class="local">'Evaluation for the cause of primary adrenal insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Normal aldosterone and renin</strong> – Normal aldosterone and renin levels are consistent with central adrenal insufficiency, which leads to cortisol but not mineralocorticoid deficiency. However, aldosterone and renin may be normal in primary adrenal insufficiency if the underlying cause affects zona fasciculata function alone. For example, preserved aldosterone production may be evident in primary adrenal insufficiency due to adrenal hemorrhage, infectious adrenalitis, or metastatic disease. Further, in central adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoid deficiency rarely may evolve after very prolonged deficiency of ACTH.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If renin and aldosterone levels are normal in a patient who has an indeterminate ACTH level and a clinical history suggestive of cortisol deficiency only under physiologic stress, we make a diagnosis of partial central adrenal insufficiency. With partial central adrenal insufficiency, ACTH production is adequate for cortisol secretion in unstressed conditions but fails to increase appropriately during physiologic stress. Therefore, under unstressed conditions, the serum cortisol value may not be overtly low, and the plasma ACTH level is often indeterminate. Partial adrenal insufficiency is uncommon but may occur, for example, in patients with central adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary surgery, trauma, or opioid use. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation for the cause of central adrenal insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H287474069"><span class="h2">Secondary versus tertiary adrenal insufficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to differentiate, although this distinction is seldom important from a therapeutic standpoint. In rare cases, this distinction may be necessary to determine the etiology of adrenal insufficiency, particularly when both exogenous (eg, glucocorticoid or opioid exposure) and endogenous (eg, hypothalamic tumor) causes are considered in the differential etiology. Previously, dynamic testing with administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) could be performed to differentiate between secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency. However, CRH is no longer available in many regions of the world. In the absence of CRH, this distinction typically is made on a clinical basis alone.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3965987773"><span class="h1">EVALUATION FOR THE CAUSE OF PRIMARY ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency is established, we next determine the underlying etiology  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113308" data-inline-graphics="113308" href="/z/d/graphic/113308.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Primary malignancies of breast, lung, and colon, as well as melanoma and lymphoma, can metastasize to the adrenal glands. Additionally, primary adrenal lymphoma may cause primary adrenal insufficiency.

Patients who develop adrenal insufficiency acutely after treatment with adrenolytic medications often do not need further etiologic testing.

Additional diagnostic tests for individuals with negative anti-21-hydroxylase antibody titers include plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs; males only) and contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113308" href="/z/d/graphic/113308.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). For patients with evidence of infectious, hemorrhagic, metastatic, or infiltrative adrenal disease, the underlying cause should be identified and treated appropriately.

Exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids is the most common cause of central adrenal insufficiency; patients with recent (discontinued within the past three months), supraphysiologic (≥5 mg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> daily or equivalent for ≥2 weeks) glucocorticoid exposures do not require additional diagnostic testing unless other risk factors for pituitary dysfunction are present. (See <a class="local">'History of exogenous glucocorticoid use'</a> above and <a class="local">'Evaluation for other causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diagnostic testing</strong> – We evaluate for hypo- or hypersecretion of other pituitary hormones in all patients except those with clearly established hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression due to exogenous glucocorticoid therapy and no other risk factors for pituitary dysfunction. For individuals with evidence of hypo- or hypersecretion of other pituitary hormones or those for whom the etiology remains uncertain, we proceed with imaging. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the sella turcica can detect adrenal insufficiency due to lymphocytic, infiltrative, or infectious forms of hypophysitis; sellar tumors; pituitary metastases; or secondary empty sella syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of other pituitary hormones'</a> above and <a class="local">'MRI of the sella turcica and additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1133751010"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The views expressed in this topic are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official views or policy of the United States Government or its components.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Bornstein SR, Allolio B, Arlt W, et al.
