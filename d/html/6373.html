The condition exists in 2 to 5 percent of children and can occur at any age [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Untreated pediatric OSA is associated with behavioral and learning problems; in more severe cases, it can be associated with impaired growth (including failure to thrive) and cardiovascular complications. Early diagnosis and treatment may decrease morbidity [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Treatment decisions should be made collaboratively with the patient and family and depend on findings from a comprehensive evaluation, including nighttime sleep disruption, daytime dysfunction, physical examination findings, and sleep study findings, as well as child/parent preferences.</p><p>An overview of surgical and medical management of children with confirmed OSA is reviewed here. The diagnostic evaluation of suspected OSA in children is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6363.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children"</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about specific treatments for OSA in children is available from the following topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97855.html" rel="external">"Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97854.html" rel="external">"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2816589166"><span class="h1">CONSEQUENCES OF UNTREATED OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potential consequences of untreated OSA in children include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inattention and behavioral problems (eg, hyperactivity, impulsivity, rebelliousness and aggression) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16641.html" rel="external">"Cognitive and behavioral consequences of sleep disorders in children", section on 'Sleep-related breathing disorders'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Daytime sleepiness</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Growth – Severe OSA can be associated with failure to thrive, and treatment can lead to weight gain and growth</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiovascular disease – Cardiovascular consequences may include systemic hypertension, right and left ventricular dysfunction, and cor pulmonale (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97874.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea in children"</a>)</p><p></p><p>Each of these conditions may benefit from treatment of OSA, though in some cases, definitive proof at the level of randomized clinical trials does not yet exist. The evidence for these complications are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6363.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CHOICE OF THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial screening for OSA is typically done by the primary care clinician  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119308" href="/d/graphic/119308.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Children with suspected OSA should be referred to a specialist in sleep medicine or otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat). Alternatively, the referring provider may be able to arrange for a polysomnogram (PSG) if a facility with experience in pediatric PSG is available. Children with abnormal results of PSG, or with other significant sleep problems, can then be referred to the appropriate specialist. OSA is typically defined by clinically relevant symptoms and an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;1 or hypoventilation (carbon dioxide &gt;50 mmHg for &gt;25 percent total sleep time) as determined on PSG. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6363.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children"</a>.)</p><p>The decision to initiate treatment and choice of treatment depend on the child's age, clinical symptoms (eg, nighttime sleep problems or daytime dysfunction), presence of comorbidities (especially underlying genetic, craniofacial, neuromuscular disorders), risk factors (eg, obesity, crowded oropharynx), and results of PSG if performed, as outlined below [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adenotonsillectomy</strong> – Referral to a specialist for adenotonsillectomy evaluation is generally indicated for otherwise healthy children who have OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy (including ≥1+ tonsils) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. After the full evaluation, the decision about whether to proceed to surgery should be made collaboratively with the family, considering in particular the degree of clinical symptoms (nocturnal and daytime  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111055" href="/d/graphic/111055.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) as well as the tonsil size and OSA severity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6363.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'Assessment of severity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Adenotonsillectomy also may be initial therapy for children with other contributors to OSA such as obesity or other comorbidities, if appreciable adenotonsillar tissue is present, even if there is no clear hypertrophy. The rationale is that adenotonsillectomy may improve upper airway patency enough to ameliorate or resolve the OSA, even if it does not correct all of the etiologies. Such patients should be managed by a clinician experienced with pediatric sleep-related respiratory abnormalities [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97855.html" rel="external">"Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'Indications for surgery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Watchful waiting</strong> <strong>for up to six months</strong> – For otherwise healthy children with mild or moderate OSA confirmed by PSG (AHI &gt;1 and &lt;10), watchful waiting with supportive care is a reasonable alternative to adenotonsillectomy. Supportive care may include conservative medical management (with treatment or referral for treatment of comorbidities such as asthma and allergic rhinitis), education regarding sleep hygiene and healthy sleep behaviors, and the use of nasal <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> spray as needed for nasal mucosal dryness or crusting. This approach is based on the acceptable outcomes for children five to nine years old who were followed with watchful waiting in the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and a similar trial in younger children [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In both of these studies, adenotonsillectomy compared with watchful waiting led to improvement in daytime behavior, sleep apnea symptoms, subjective sleepiness, and quality of life. These observations underscore the importance of assessing the child's level of symptoms when making a decision between adenotonsillectomy and watchful waiting (see <a class="local">'Adenotonsillectomy'</a> below). If watchful waiting is chosen, the child should be reevaluated clinically within six months or reevaluated sooner if symptoms worsen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We suggest against watchful waiting for children with severe OSA (eg, AHI &gt;10 or other PSG measures suggesting severe OSA), particularly if multiple symptoms or risk factors are present. This suggestion is based on observational studies and indirect evidence from the CHAT trial, as detailed below. (See <a class="local">'Adenotonsillectomy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positive airway pressure therapy</strong> – For patients with minimal adenotonsillar tissue or a strong preference for a nonsurgical approach, positive airway pressure therapy is an alternative to adenotonsillectomy [<a href="#rid4">4,7-10</a>]. It also may be appropriate to stabilize children with severe OSA prior to adenotonsillectomy or another surgical procedure or for children with persistent OSA despite adenotonsillectomy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Positive airway pressure may consist of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). (See <a class="local">'Positive airway pressure'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97854.html" rel="external">"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Treatment decisions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The following treatments can be considered in selected cases, either instead of or as an adjunct to the primary therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rapid maxillary expansion (RME)</strong> – Prepubertal children with OSA and a narrow palate (crossbite) and little adenotonsillar tissue are candidates for treatment with RME. RME is an orthodontic technique that widens the palate and nasal passages, thereby increasing airway patency. Such patients should be managed by an orthodontist experienced with pediatric sleep-related respiratory abnormalities. (See <a class="local">'Orthodontics'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mandibular advancement device</strong> – A mandibular advancement device is a specific, common type of oral appliance that protrudes the mandible and helps to position the tongue anteriorly, thus increasing airway patency. Limited data are available from children about the relative efficacy and risks compared with other treatment methods. However, this approach may be reasonable to consider when other treatment methods have failed. Availability of a dentist experienced in oral appliance therapy for children may be a limiting reality in many areas. (See <a class="local">'Mandibular advancement device'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Corticosteroids or antiinflammatory therapy</strong> – For children with mild or moderate OSA and nasal obstruction due to adenoidal hypertrophy/allergic rhinitis, a trial of intranasal corticosteroids or leukotriene modifier therapy may be performed for two to four weeks, prior to determining whether the therapy should be continued long-term as an adjunct or alternative to adenotonsillectomy or positive airway pressure. (See <a class="local">'Intranasal corticosteroids or montelukast'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other</strong> <strong>therapies</strong> – Selected children with OSA may derive benefit from adjunctive therapies. As examples, obese children with OSA may benefit from weight loss and all children may benefit from avoidance of environmental allergens or irritants such as tobacco smoke. In addition, positional therapy (eg, elevation of the head of the bed) can be considered. Several of these adjunctive therapies are described below. (See <a class="local">'Adjunct therapies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">SURGICAL THERAPY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Adenotonsillectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adenotonsillectomy refers to surgical resection of the tonsils and adenoids. Key information relevant to the primary care clinician is summarized below, and details are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97855.html" rel="external">"Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – Adenotonsillectomy is generally indicated for otherwise healthy children who have adenotonsillar hypertrophy and severe OSA (eg, apnea hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;10, in the setting of relevant clinical symptoms). For patients with nonsevere OSA (eg, AHI 1 to 10 on polysomnography [PSG]), either adenotonsillectomy or watchful waiting for up to six months are reasonable approaches; the decision usually depends on the degree of overnight and daytime symptoms and the patient's and family's preferences. In obese children, OSA usually improves following adenotonsillectomy, although the outcome may be less satisfactory than in lean children. Considerations for children without apparent adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and for those with underlying conditions that are associated with multilevel OSA including Down syndrome and craniofacial anomalies, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97855.html" rel="external">"Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'Indications for surgery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcomes</strong> – Children with OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy generally have improvements in clinical symptoms and PSG indices of OSA after adenotonsillectomy. In the past, this was largely based on clinical experience and observational studies. In 2013, a randomized trial (Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial [CHAT]) demonstrated an advantage of adenotonsillectomy over watchful waiting for children five to nine years old with uncomplicated OSA (AHI 1 to 30) who were candidates for adenotonsillectomy (tonsil size ≥1) [<a href="#rid5">5,11</a>]. Specifically, adenotonsillectomy compared with watchful waiting led to improvement in overnight sleep apnea symptoms, daytime behavior, subjective sleepiness, and quality of life. However, no differences emerged in cognitive measures of attention or executive function, which were the primary outcomes of the study. Modest benefits of adenotonsillectomy were seen in selected areas of cognitive functioning, including nonverbal reasoning, fine motor skills, and selective attention [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Similar findings were reported in a randomized trial that involved 60 younger children (age 2 to &lt;5 years) with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 2 to 10) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Children who underwent adenotonsillectomy compared with watchful waiting for six months had significant improvements in a quality-of-life measure, and the subgroup with moderate OSA (AHI 5 to 10) had a potentially meaningful relative improvement in AHI (mean change in AHI -3.1, 95% CI -5.7 to -0.5).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Children with severe OSA (eg, AHI &gt;10) are probably particularly likely to benefit from adenotonsillectomy rather than watchful waiting, based on clinical experience and indirect evidence from the CHAT trial. The CHAT trial did not specifically analyze this subgroup of patients, but it did find that for those with AHI above the median (&gt;4.7 events/hour), adenotonsillectomy compared with watchful waiting led to greater improvement in AHI [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The CHAT trial was not informative about patients with very severe OSA, because it excluded such patients (those with an AHI &gt;30, an apnea index &gt;20, or &gt;2 percent of total sleep time spent with oxygen saturations &lt;90 percent). The CHAT study also was not informative about outcomes of watchful waiting for other groups of excluded children, including those with recurrent tonsillitis; cardiovascular comorbidities; medication use for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or psychiatric disorders; severe obesity (body mass index Z-score ≥3); developmental delays requiring school accommodations; and known genetic, craniofacial, or neurologic disorders likely to affect the airway, cognition, or behavior.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Outcomes of adenotonsillectomy are covered in more depth separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97855.html" rel="external">"Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'Success rates'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16641.html" rel="external">"Cognitive and behavioral consequences of sleep disorders in children", section on 'Sleep-related breathing disorders'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors for complicated OSA</strong> – Risk factors in children that predict increased risk for perioperative complications following adenotonsillectomy include severe OSA on preoperative PSG or the presence of complicating factors such as obesity (especially if severe), very young age (&lt;36 months), abnormal upper airway tone, congenital syndromes, or craniofacial anomalies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103835" href="/d/graphic/103835.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Patients with these characteristics warrant additional precautions during the evaluation, surgical procedure, and postoperative monitoring of adenotonsillectomy and may require adjuvant surgical procedures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97855.html" rel="external">"Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'High-risk populations'</a> and <a class="local">'Adjuvant surgical procedures'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up after adenotonsillectomy</strong> – All children who undergo surgical therapy should follow up with their primary care clinician or sleep specialist six to eight weeks after surgery to ensure that the symptoms or signs of OSA have resolved [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Children who have persistent snoring or other symptoms or signs of increased upper airway resistance at this follow-up visit should also undergo PSG to ensure that their sleep-related breathing abnormalities have resolved [<a href="#rid4">4,13</a>]. Repeat PSG is also indicated for children who have had complications from OSA (eg, cor pulmonale), those with severe OSA on preoperative PSG, and those with craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities (including Down and Prader-Willi syndromes) [<a href="#rid4">4,14-17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97855.html" rel="external">"Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children", section on 'Indications for postoperative polysomnography'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some patients will have gradual reemergence of OSA months or years after adenotonsillectomy due to increases in body weight, regrowth of adenotonsillar tissue, or changes in body shape due to puberty [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. Thus, reevaluation with PSG is indicated later if symptoms or signs of OSA develop or worsen in a child who has a history of OSA, even if the OSA was thought to have resolved following initial therapy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Adenoidectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adenoidectomy alone (without tonsillectomy) is not recommended for treatment of OSA in children [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Obstructive symptoms and signs frequently persist after adenoidectomy alone is performed [<a href="#rid20">20-24</a>]. In addition, many children who undergo adenoidectomy are not spared tonsillectomy, since children who undergo adenoidectomy for the treatment of OSA are twice as likely to need eventual tonsillectomy as compared with children who undergo adenoidectomy for other indications [<a href="#rid22">22,25</a>]. Conversely, some data also suggest that tonsillectomy without adenoidectomy is less effective than the combined procedure in treating pediatric OSA.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1869565953"><span class="h2">Adjuvant surgical procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with congenital syndromes, craniofacial abnormalities, mucopolysaccharidosis, or neuromuscular disorders are likely to have multifactorial OSA, in which the obstruction is due to factors other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy alone and may occur at multiple sites within the airway. In addition to adenotonsillectomy, these children may need adjuvant surgical procedures, including uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, supraglottoplasty, tongue reduction, tongue base procedures, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty, lateral pharyngoplasty, and mandibular distraction osteogenesis. Tracheotomy is reserved for children with severe OSA who have failed to respond to other treatment approaches. Management is discussed separately.

It involves administering airway pressure through a mask, which prevents upper airway obstruction and reduces both sleep disruption and the work of breathing [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Positive airway pressure is a long-term therapy that requires a motivated family. Adherence to therapy is challenging but can be optimized with proper mask fitting, positive pressure titration, and behavioral support.

CPAP applies a constant level of positive airway pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, whereas BPAP applies a higher level of positive airway pressure during inspiration than during exhalation. BiPAP is the name of a BPAP unit manufactured by Philips Respironics Corporation; it is just one of several commercially available machines that can deliver BPAP.

Proper technique and family support are essential to optimize adherence to therapy. The pressure level should be periodically rechecked with repeat polysomnography (PSG), especially if there are changes in the child's clinical status (eg, recurrence of snoring despite using CPAP, recurrent daytime symptoms) or substantial changes in the child's weight or body mass index percentiles [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

Many are related to a suboptimal mask fit and can be avoided by regular evaluation of the mask fit (eg, every four to six months). Examples include eye irritation, conjunctivitis, skin ulceration, skin discoloration (lightening or darkening) and discomfort or irritation at the site where the mask contacts the skin [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. These problems can be minimized by proper fitting of the mask and refitting as the child grows. The mask should be fitted as loosely as possible while avoiding air leaks to minimize the pressure on the face because this pressure can alter facial or dental development during long-term use. Nasal complaints, such as congestion or rhinorrhea, are also common. Nasal corticosteroids or humidification of the delivered air can help relieve these symptoms. Aerophagia can occur if the child swallows air through the night resulting in bloating, burping, and passing gas in the mornings. With positive airway pressure, central sleep apnea occasionally emerges; this is known as "treatment-emergent central sleep apnea."

Evaluation may include Mallampati score, intraoral and extraoral photographs, lateral cephalograms in maximum intercuspal position, and dental impressions. Contraindications to oral appliance therapy may include temporomandibular joint disease, instability of the jaw, limited range of motion of the jaw, missing teeth, or young age (because young children will require multiple oral appliances to accommodate growth). Only a few devices have been tested in children with published data. Once a child is fit with a mandibular advancement device, a new PSG should be performed to confirm improvement in AHI and oxygen desaturation, in addition to clinical improvements.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Guidelines for titrating mandibular advancement devices are available for adults with OSA; however, no separate guidelines exist for children.

These therapies are typically considered as an alternative or adjunct to adenotonsillectomy or as a temporizing measure during the watchful waiting period prior to other interventions. If this approach is selected, a two- to four-week trial of the medication should be performed to decide if it would be useful for long-term therapy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

When nocturnal oxygen supplementation is deemed necessary for children with OSA, it should be initiated by a specialist who has experience managing children with sleep disorders. All children receiving oxygen therapy should be assessed for wake and sleep hypercapnia by measuring end-tidal carbon dioxide or transcutaneous carbon dioxide during the overnight sleep study when the supplemental oxygen is titrated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The use of supplemental oxygen as a bridging therapy is rare in our practice and is reserved for children who cannot tolerate CPAP or BPAP. Although supplemental oxygen at night improves oxygenation during sleep, it does not always improve the episodic complete or partial upper airway obstruction that characterizes OSA, nor most of the consequences of OSA (eg, sleep fragmentation, hypercapnia). In some patients, it may suppress the ventilatory drive and worsen hypercapnia. This effect was seen in a crossover trial that randomly assigned 23 children with OSA to receive oxygen therapy or room air via nasal cannula for four hours [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].

Although antibiotic therapy reduces the size of the tonsils and adenoids in some children, this may temporarily improve the OSA but does not provide persistent relief or avoid the need for surgery. An occasional course of antibiotics may be appropriate for children with recurrent throat infections; for these children, the decision about when to proceed to adenotonsillectomy depends on the frequency and severity of the infections. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6296.html" rel="external">"Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in children: Indications and contraindications", section on 'Recurrent throat infection'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The effect of antibiotics on OSA was evaluated in a trial of 22 children (2 to 12 years old) with OSA [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].

Paradoxically, the prone position may exacerbate OSA in some patients, so the optimal position varies [<a href="#rid57">57,58</a>]. In patients whose AHI varies markedly with position and whose OSA cannot be treated or treated completely by other means, positional therapy (avoidance of the position that appears on PSG to exacerbate sleep apnea) may be a consideration. Tools to maintain a nonsupine position include several commercially available belts and pillows, including the Rematee belt (available in children's sizes) and the Sona Pillow. However, positional therapy has not been well studied in children. Studies in adults have been small and lack randomization [<a href="#rid59">59,60</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Choice of therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Adenotonsillectomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>After the full evaluation, the decision about whether to proceed to surgery should be made collaboratively with the family, considering in particular the degree of clinical symptoms (nocturnal and daytime  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111055" href="/d/graphic/111055.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)), as well as the tonsil size and OSA severity on PSG.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Risk factors in children that predict increased risk for perioperative complications following adenotonsillectomy include severe OSA on preoperative PSG or the presence of complicating factors such as obesity (especially if severe), age &lt;3 years, abnormal upper airway tone, congenital syndrome, or craniofacial anomalies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103835" href="/d/graphic/103835.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Despite adenotonsillectomy, OSA may persist or recur, especially in children with obesity. Careful clinical follow-up for signs and symptoms of OSA is advisable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positive airway pressure therapy</strong> – For children with OSA and minimal adenotonsillar tissue, a strong preference for a nonsurgical approach, or contraindications to adenotonsillectomy, we suggest positive airway pressure therapy (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). This is also an option for patients who have undergone adenotonsillectomy but have residual OSA. Positive airway pressure can be delivered as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). (See <a class="local">'Positive airway pressure'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97854.html" rel="external">"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Watchful waiting</strong> – For patients with nonsevere OSA that has been confirmed by PSG (eg, AHI 1 to 10), watchful waiting with supportive care (continued treatment for seasonal allergies and asthma) for up to six months can be a reasonable consideration as an alternative to adenotonsillectomy. This is based on the acceptable outcomes for patients followed with watchful waiting in a randomized trial. If this approach is chosen, the child should be reevaluated within six months for worsening of clinical symptoms or reevaluated sooner if symptoms worsen. (See <a class="local">'Choice of therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Adenotonsillectomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Orthodontics</strong> – Prepubertal children with OSA and a narrow palate (crossbite) and little adenotonsillar tissue are candidates for treatment with rapid maxillary expansion (RME). RME is an orthodontic technique that widens the palate and nasal passages, thereby increasing airway patency. Mandibular advancement devices (oral appliances) typically consist of a top tray and bottom tray and are used to advance the mandible and keep the tongue in an anterior position, thus increasing airway diameter. (See <a class="local">'Orthodontics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General measures</strong> – For all children with OSA, efforts should be made to minimize exposure to environmental allergens or irritants such as tobacco smoke. Children with obesity should be offered support for weight loss. (See <a class="local">'General measures for all children with obstructive sleep apnea'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adjunct therapies</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Children who have severe OSA-related hypoxemia may benefit from nocturnal supplemental oxygen until definitive therapy can be provided. When nocturnal supplemental oxygen therapy is necessary, it should be initiated during a PSG with assessment for hypercapnia. (See <a class="local">'Adjunct therapies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Positional therapy may be considered for patients in whom the severity of sleep-disordered breathing varies substantially with the sleep position and other OSA treatments are not adequately effective. Positional therapy consists of positioning to avoid supine sleep by using specially designed belts or pillows or elevation of the head of the bed. (See <a class="local">'Adjunct therapies'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Rosen CL, Storfer-Isser A, Taylor HG, et al.
