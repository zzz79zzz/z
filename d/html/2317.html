         The serum sodium concentration is the primary determinant of serum tonicity (also known as "effective serum osmolality") (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2354.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnostic evaluation of adults with hyponatremia"
         </a>
         ). The fall in serum tonicity in patients with hypotonic hyponatremia promotes water movement into the brain and, if the hyponatremia is acute and severe, can lead to cerebral edema and neurologic symptoms. In response to hyponatremia, the brain makes adaptations that lower the cerebral volume toward normal and reduce the likelihood of these complications. The mechanisms responsible for this cerebral adaptation are discussed elsewhere:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         However, brain adaptations that reduce the risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury if chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected. The neurologic manifestations associated with overly rapid correction have been called the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS; formerly called central pontine myelinolysis or CPM). As will be described below, almost all patients who develop ODS present with a serum sodium concentration of 120 mEq/L or less.

         Issues related to ODS and the approach to the patient with unintentional overly rapid correction of hyponatremia will be reviewed here. A general overview of the treatment of hyponatremia is presented separately. (See

          BRAIN ADAPTATION TO HYPONATREMIA

         A decrease in serum tonicity causes water to flow across the blood-brain barrier, increasing brain water content. The decrease in serum tonicity also causes brain cells, primarily astrocytes, to swell. Astrocytes are cells that surround brain capillaries and express water channels on their foot processes; these cells protect neurons from swelling via a cell-to-cell transfer of cellular solutes and water [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The brain begins to adapt to hypotonicity almost immediately after a fall in serum sodium, and the adaptation is complete within two days. If the brain were unable to adapt, even mild hyponatremia would result in life-threatening cerebral edema. However, within minutes after a fall in serum sodium, increased intracranial pressure forces interstitial sodium and water out of the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid, ameliorating the increased brain volume. In addition, astrocytes begin to lose intracellular solutes, principally potassium and organic solutes (called osmolytes), within hours of a fall in serum sodium and serum tonicity. This process permits these cells to shed excess water and to have the same tonicity as plasma without a large increase in cell water  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71152" href="/z/d/graphic/71152.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2287.html" rel="external">
          "Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Osmolytes and cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the brain is able to adapt to hypotonicity, hyponatremia that develops over more than two to three days is not associated with severe brain swelling; it is therefore much less likely to be complicated by seizures and coma, and is extremely unlikely to produce brain herniation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, once the brain has adapted to hypotonicity, the rate of correction of the hyponatremia becomes important. Overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia can lead to the ODS. By contrast, rapid correction is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         likely to induce ODS in patients with severe hyponatremia that has only been present for several hours, since the cerebral adaptation is at an early stage. Examples include water intoxication in marathon runners, psychotic patients, and users of ecstasy; rapid correction does not usually lead to ODS in these patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Demyelination of the central pons (CPM) is one manifestation of ODS. However, brain demyelination that is associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia may be more diffuse, and it does not always involve the pons [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ].

          PATHOGENESIS OF ODS

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         How the ODS occurs is not completely understood. Chronic hyponatremia is associated with the loss of osmotically active organic osmolytes (such as myoinositol, glutamate, and glutamine) from astrocytes, which provide protection against brain cell swelling. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2287.html" rel="external">
          "Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Osmolytes and cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, organic osmolytes cannot be as quickly replaced when the brain volume begins to shrink in response to correction of the hyponatremia [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ]. As a result, brain volume can fall from a value that is initially somewhat above normal to one below normal with rapid correction of hyponatremia. Studies in rats have shown that demyelination primarily occurs in areas of the brain that are slowest in reaccumulating osmolytes after rapid correction of hyponatremia [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In experimental models, the mechanism by which a rapid fall in brain volume results in demyelination is best explained by direct injury to astrocytes and/or oligodendrocytes (cells of the glial syncytium) that are crucial for normal myelination and remyelination after demyelinative injury and for maintenance of the blood-brain barrier [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ]. After rapid correction of hyponatremia, the loss of cell water coupled with the movement of potassium and sodium back into these cells lead to an initial increase in cell cation concentration that occurs before the repletion of organic osmolytes [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9,15
         </a>
         ]. Within 12 hours, these combined changes cause protein aggregation, DNA fragmentation, and induce markers of programmed cell death. Approximately 24 hours after the osmotic insult, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes begin to die in regions of the brain that are affected by demyelination, and this may be accompanied by release of inflammatory cytokines and activation of microglia [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Endothelial damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier occur later, after the injury to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>

         The ODS primarily occurs with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration almost always 120 mEq/L or less) that has been present for more than two to three days, which is the time required for the cerebral adaptation to become maximal [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,7,18,19
         </a>
         ]. However, some patients are particularly susceptible to this complication and can develop ODS with less severe hyponatremia (ie, with initial serum sodium concentrations above 120 mEq/L) and slower rates of correction.

         </span>
         The majority of ODS cases occur in patients whose sodium concentrations at presentation are ≤105 mEq/L, and the vast majority of reported cases arise in patients who present with a serum sodium of 120 mEq/L or less [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,7,18-21
         </a>
         ]. In one large study of 83 patients with ODS documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the mean serum sodium was 104 mEq/L; 75 percent had a serum sodium ≤110 mEq/L, and 26 percent had a serum sodium ≤100 mEq/L [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. When the initial serum sodium is greater than 120 mEq/L, ODS is rare and typically limited to two clinical scenarios:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study of patients with serum sodium concentrations that were ≤105 mEq/L, correction by &gt;12 mEq/L in 24 hours or &gt;18 mEq/L in 48 hours was associated with posttherapeutic neurologic complications; over one-half of the chronically hyponatremic patients who were corrected this rapidly developed complications, while all patients who were corrected more slowly had uneventful recoveries [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Another study identified only four cases of ODS among 37 patients with a serum sodium that was ≤120 mEq/L who were corrected by &gt;12 mEq/L in 24 hours and no cases of ODS among 218 patients who were more slowly corrected [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. However, all cases with ODS in this series had an initial serum sodium of ≤105 mEq/L.
        </p>
        <p>
         The likely reason for these observations is the fact that patients who have more severe hyponatremia at presentation tend to experience a larger increase in the serum sodium concentration during treatment [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Cerebral adaptation in patients with very severe hyponatremia (eg, &lt;105 mEq/L) requires greater depletion of brain organic osmolytes, and therefore, these patients are also more likely to develop ODS after rapid correction.

          Duration of hyponatremia

          —
         </span>
         Studies in experimental animals showed that brain damage does not occur when hyponatremia of less than one day's duration is rapidly corrected [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ]. However, if hyponatremia persists for two to three days or more, the same treatment results in usually fatal demyelinating brain lesions [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25-35
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Similar findings have been noted in humans. Neurologic deterioration following rapid correction of hyponatremia is unlikely in patients with severe hyponatremia that develops over a few hours, particularly in those whose normal water excretory capacity rapidly and spontaneously returns the serum sodium to normal. Examples include the ingestion of large amounts of water over several hours by marathon runners, psychotic patients, and users of ecstasy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,19,36
         </a>
         ]. In these patients, hyponatremia develops rapidly, and the brain does not have time to fully adapt. By contrast, patients who develop hyponatremia more gradually have time for the brain adaptation and may develop the ODS after rates of correction that are well tolerated in patients with self-induced acute water intoxication [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7,19
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Brain adaptation to hyponatremia'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the duration of hyponatremia is a major determinant of susceptibility to ODS, it is often not known. Thus, clinicians should
         <strong>
          assume that the patient has chronic hyponatremia
         </strong>
         unless there are available serum sodium measurements that document acute onset or unless the history is notable for acute water intoxication (ie, consumption of a large volume of water over a few hours preceding measurement of the serum sodium). Conversely, an acute onset of severe neurologic symptoms should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be interpreted to mean that hyponatremia is acute. While uncommon, a sudden onset of severe symptoms can occur in patients whose hyponatremia developed over several days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Polydipsia does not always convey resistance to osmotic demyelination, since some polydipsic patients have hyponatremia of sufficient duration to permit cerebral adaptation. As an example, ODS has been reported in malnourished patients with alcohol use disorder who present with polydipsia and chronic hyponatremia [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. In addition, alcohol use disorder and malnutrition are risk factors for osmotic demyelination. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2374.html" rel="external">
          "Causes of hypotonic hyponatremia in adults", section on 'Primary polydipsia due to psychosis'

         Studies in experimental animals have shown that osmotic demyelination is caused by correction of hyponatremia and not by hyponatremia itself, and that more rapid rates of correction increase the likelihood and severity of brain lesions [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The threshold rate of correction, above which brain lesions may develop, is approximately 15 mEq/L per day in dogs and 16 mEq/L in rats; the incidence of lesions progressively increases with larger magnitudes of daily correction, and the majority of animals will be affected if the correction rate exceeds 25 mEq/L per day [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ]. The effect of the hourly rate of correction is influenced by the daily rate of correction. Specifically, a more rapid hourly rate of correction is associated with more severe lesions only if the daily rate threshold is exceeded [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,40
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, if the daily rate of correction remains lower than the threshold for inducing osmotic demyelination, then even extremely rapid hourly rates (as much as 12 mEq/L per hour) can be well tolerated [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational studies in humans are consistent with experimental studies in animals, showing that more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia are associated with osmotic demyelination [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,14,21,23,37,41-43
         </a>
         ]. Most of these studies report the total increase in the serum sodium concentration over a 24- or 48-hour period and not the hourly rate of correction expressed in mEq/L per hour. Thus, our recommendations on the rate of correction of hyponatremia are based upon the daily, rather than the hourly, rate of correction.

        <p>
         It is difficult to define a threshold rate of correction below which ODS will not occur. Some well-documented cases have been reported in which ODS developed after correction by 8 mEq/L per day [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ], and a large cohort study has shown that correction by less than 5 mEq/L per day was not associated with neurologic complications [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, because there is no proven advantage to correcting severe hyponatremia (serum sodium &lt;120 mEq/L) by more than 4 to 6 mEq/L per day, we and other authors recommend that the rate of correction of hyponatremia should not exceed 6 to 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,45
         </a>
         ]. This is not a goal of therapy, but rather a therapeutic limit that should not be exceeded. In the past, it was thought that the serum sodium concentration should be increased to a supposedly "safe" level of 120 to 128 mEq/L. There is no evidence to support this practice, and doing so could result in marked overcorrection of hyponatremia in patients with very low serum sodium concentrations. We recommend a correction goal of 4 to 6 mEq/L per day, no matter how low the initial serum sodium concentration is. (See

         Autocorrection of the serum sodium can occur in the following settings:

         Autocorrection of a reversible impairment in water excretion is an important reason why equations that are used to calculate the serum sodium response to a given fluid regimen frequently fail to predict the actual response. In a study of hyponatremic patients who were treated with hypertonic
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         , for example, the actual rate of correction of the serum sodium exceeded the predicted rate in 29 of 39 patients (74 percent) whose pretreatment sodium concentration was less than 120 mEq/L [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Ten patients had overly rapid correction; in these patients, the rise in serum sodium was 2.4 times the predicted value and was due to a documented water diuresis (defined as a low urine osmolality) in four.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another setting in which overly rapid correction can occur is in patients with end-stage kidney disease who are treated with hemodialysis. Although ODS can occur [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56,57
         </a>
         ], it is thought to be a rare event [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The reasons why ODS is uncommon in patients treated with hemodialysis are not completely understood; however, one mechanism may be that the rise in serum osmolality induced by the rise in serum sodium during dialysis may be counterbalanced by a fall in serum osmolality induced by the removal of urea [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,58
         </a>
         ]. Urea crosses the blood-brain barrier relatively slowly compared with osmotic water movement and therefore acts as an effective osmole when serum levels are rapidly reduced. Another possible mechanism is that azotemia enhances brain reuptake of organic osmolytes during correction of hyponatremia, minimizing cellular shrinking [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>

         Several other factors appear to increase the susceptibility to osmotic demyelination. When these factors are present, ODS can develop at less severe degrees of hyponatremia and slower rates of correction [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5,18,25,37,52,59,60
         </a>
         ]. These include alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, liver disease, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,21,61,62
         </a>
         ]. In a large study of 83 patients with MRI-documented ODS, for example, 70 percent had an alcohol use disorder and 68 percent had hypokalemia [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Females of childbearing age are thought to be more susceptible to fatal cerebral edema associated with acute hyponatremia [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. However, there is no evidence that sex increases the risk of ODS.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some authors have emphasized the role of hypoxia in the pathogenesis of brain damage associated with hyponatremia, including the demyelinating brain lesions [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64-67
         </a>
         ]. The genesis of this theory can be traced to a case series that included seven females who exhibited a biphasic neurologic course, typical of osmotic demyelination, following hyponatremic seizures [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. The author attributed these findings to seizure-induced brain anoxia and a delayed postanoxic encephalopathy, a demyelinating disorder usually associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. However, in addition to an anoxic insult caused by seizures, these patients had also been treated with hypertonic
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         and had experienced hyponatremia correction rates exceeding 25 mEq/L in less than 48 hours. It is not clear whether the brain damage sustained in these females was due to hypoxia, which can exacerbate brain swelling in experimental models of hyponatremia and may contribute to a fatal outcome, or whether these females had ODS [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64,65,67
         </a>
         ]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was not available at the time, might have detected the characteristic brain lesions of osmotic demyelination [

          —
         </span>
         The incidence of ODS in patients with chronic, hypotonic hyponatremia depends primarily upon the severity of hyponatremia and the rate of correction. Other factors, such as alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, liver disease, and hypokalemia, further increase the incidence. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors for ODS'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence is high in patients with severe, chronic hyponatremia who are rapidly corrected. As an example, in one study of 255 patients admitted to two academic teaching hospitals with serum sodium &lt;120 mEq/L, 11 percent of those corrected by &gt;12 mEq/L in 24 hours developed ODS; none of those corrected more slowly developed ODS [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. In two other studies, approximately 50 percent of patients with serum sodium ≤105 mEq/L who were corrected too quickly developed ODS [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Based upon an analysis of hospital administrative data, one group has concluded that ODS is rare [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68,69
         </a>
         ]. In one large cohort of patients admitted with serum sodium &lt;130 mEq/L over 10 years, they reported that the incidence of ODS was only 0.05 percent. However, 87 percent of the cohort had an initial serum sodium ≥120 mEq/L, a population known to be at very low risk for ODS. Of those admitted with serum sodium &lt;110 mEq/L, the ODS incidence was 2.6 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Due to multiple limitations of this study, 2.6 percent is likely to be a substantial underestimate of the true incidence of ODS in rapidly corrected patients with this severity of hyponatremia [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. As an example, ODS was identified using neuroimaging studies (MRI or CT) that were performed during the same hospitalization, or if the patient was readmitted within seven days and had ODS listed as the primary reason for hospitalization. This approach to case finding is likely to miss many patients with ODS because of the following: radiologic images are typically negative at the onset of clinical symptoms and may not be positive until weeks later; not all patients with clinical features of ODS are readmitted within seven days, and those that are admitted may have additional diagnoses listed before ODS; and patients with severe hyperglycemia (up to 450 mg/dL) and those with acute self-induced water intoxication were included in the cohort. Patients with severe hyperglycemia can have hypertonic (not hypotonic) hyponatremia, often have rapid correction of hyponatremia as the hyperglycemia is corrected, and are at low risk for ODS. Similarly, patients with acute self-induced water intoxication often correct rapidly and are unlikely to develop ODS.

         </a>
         ]. Symptoms in patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-documented pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis are frequently irreversible. As an example, in one study of 83 patients with ODS, 40 percent died or were functionally impaired at three months; 60 percent were functionally independent although some had persistent mild symptoms [

         ODS should be suspected in all patients who have risk factors for the disorder and consistent clinical manifestations. ODS is likely to be present if overly rapid correction of hyponatremia has occurred during the previous week. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients suspected of having ODS should undergo brain MRI or, if MRI is unavailable, computed tomography (CT) scanning of the brain, although CT scans are less reliable for detecting demyelinating lesions [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,41,76,77
         </a>
         ]. In one large study of 83 patients with ODS, 51 percent had central pontine demyelination only, 45 percent had both central pontine and extrapontine demyelination, and the remainder had extrapontine demyelination only [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, even MRI may not become positive for as long as four weeks after disease onset [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,41
         </a>
         ]. In some patients with a clinical course consistent with ODS, neurological findings resolve over a few days or weeks, and no lesions are ever documented by MRI [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Thus, an initially negative radiologic study in a patient who develops neurologic symptoms after overly rapid correction of hyponatremia does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         exclude ODS; if neurological findings persist, a repeat MRI should be obtained after several weeks. Earlier detection may be possible with certain MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging [

         In view of the often severe and permanent adverse consequences of ODS, prevention is essential. Among patients at heightened risk of ODS because of alcohol use disorder, severe malnutrition, or advanced liver disease, and in patients with severe hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium &lt;120 mEq/L) lasting more than two to three days or if the duration is unknown, we recommend that the serum sodium be raised by less than 6 to 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period to prevent ODS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors for ODS'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the duration of hyponatremia is a major determinant of susceptibility to ODS, it is often not known. In this setting, it is safest to assume that the patient has chronic hyponatremia unless measurements of the serum sodium document an acute onset or the history suggests acute water intoxication (ie, large volumes of water ingested over a few hours).
        </p>
        <p>
         Our recommended strategies to correct hyponatremia are presented elsewhere. However, it is often difficult to accurately estimate the effect of a treatment strategy on the serum sodium, and some patients will correct too rapidly due, for example, to the emergence of a water diuresis [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Thus, when correcting severe hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium &lt;120 mEq/L) or raising the serum sodium in patients at heightened risk for ODS, careful monitoring of the serum sodium concentration (initially, every two to three hours) is
         <strong>
          essential
         </strong>
         to avoid overly rapid correction. The urine volume should also be monitored for the emergence of a water diuresis. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients, during the course of treatment of hyponatremia, require further therapy to prevent overly rapid correction or to relower the serum sodium if overly rapid correction occurs. Such patients, and the corresponding therapeutic strategies, include [

         Some patients with an initial serum sodium concentration &lt;120 mEq/L have an initial trajectory of hyponatremia correction that appears likely to exceed the maximum recommended limit of 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period or 16 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. This often occurs in association with the development of a water diuresis (ie, urine osmolality less than 200 mosmol/kg) when a reversible stimulus to increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release has abated [
         <a href="#rid83">

         In this setting, replacement of urinary water losses with D5W can be attempted, but it is extremely labor intensive and often fails to prevent overly rapid correction [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68,83
         </a>
         ]. Rapid infusions of D5W may also exacerbate hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, potentially increasing susceptibility to ODS. The best way to prevent overly rapid correction is the administration of

          desmopressin
         </a>
         to concentrate the urine. Two exceptions are patients who cannot be relied upon to curtail water intake and, because they are at low risk of osmotic demyelination, patients with hyperacute hyponatremia developing over a few hours due to a marked increase in water intake, as can occur in marathon runners, psychotic patients, and users of ecstasy.

         </a>
         regimen begins with 2 mcg intravenously or subcutaneously. The maximum desmopressin dose is 4 mcg in patients who do not respond to lower doses. Two potential options for desmopressin administration are as follows (both require fluid restriction and careful monitoring of the urine output and serum sodium):

          desmopressin
         </a>
         every six to eight hours. Since desmopressin produces a concentrated urine, correction of the hyponatremia will slow down or cease. If necessary, a slow infusion of hypertonic

          saline

         <a href="#rid83">
          83,84
         </a>
         ]. The serum sodium should be measured every four to six hours, and the rate of hypertonic saline infusion should be adjusted if necessary. Desmopressin and, if used, hypertonic saline are continued until the serum sodium reaches 125 to 130 mEq/L. (See

         <a href="#rid83">
          83

         ]. In the second study, administration of desmopressin reduced the rate of correction from a median of 0.81 mEq/L per hour (before desmopressin) to -0.02 mEq/L per hour (after desmopressin) and decreased urine output from 650 mL per hour to 93.5 mL per hour [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82

          68

         ]. A proactive strategy was more successful than a reactive strategy in achieving a safe correction rate of 8 mEq/L or less in any 24-hour period (79 versus 30 percent), but the proactive strategy was used less frequently (11 versus 69 percent). The proactive strategy was applied without the concurrent use of 3 percent

          saline

         , which we recommend, and the authors did not specify the frequency of their desmopressin dosing. A rescue strategy was used in 46 patients (18 percent), of whom 38 had their serum sodium concentrations actively relowered by a median of 9 mEq/L without adverse consequences. There were four cases of ODS in this series, two of whom had advanced liver disease. In the two patients without advanced liver disease, one had been corrected by 10 mEq/L in 24 hours and 13 mEq/L in 48 hours using the reactive desmopressin strategy, and one had been corrected by 12 mEq/L in 24 hours in the absence of desmopressin.

         For patients with a lower risk of developing ODS, relowering may be reserved for those whose rate of correction exceeds 10 to 12 mEq/L in 24 hours [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]; however, if the sodium is not relowered, it is essential that correction not be allowed to exceed 16 mEq/L in 48 hours. The regimen for relowering the serum sodium is discussed below. (See

         Animal models provide support for relowering the serum sodium in patients with hyponatremia that has been corrected too rapidly but who do not have signs of ODS. Studies in rats have shown a marked reduction in the incidence and severity of brain lesions and in mortality when overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia (by 25 mEq/L or more over several hours) is partially reversed within 12 hours [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,34,35
         </a>
         ]. In one study, for example, rats with a serum sodium less than 115 mEq/L for three days were rapidly corrected by more than 25 mEq/L with a single intraperitoneal infusion of hypertonic
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The rats treated with therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium survived free of neurologic sequelae. By contrast, all of the control rats died or developed neurologic signs such as hyperirritability and seizures. Significant benefit from relowering the serum sodium has also been described in rats that already had neurologic symptoms of overly rapid correction (ie, established ODS) [
         <a href="#rid35">

        </p>
        <p>
         Relowering of the serum sodium can reverse the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier that occurs with overly rapid correction and can prevent the infiltration of microglia that is a feature of osmotic demyelination [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Relowering after overly rapid correction in rats is much more effective in preventing brain damage than the administration of glucocorticoids [

         Although these observations demonstrate the feasibility of relowering of the serum sodium in patients with marked hyponatremia who have corrected too rapidly, they do not prove better outcomes than watchful waiting. Evidence for improved outcomes after relowering of the serum sodium is provided only by the rat models described above and by case reports of patients with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia (less than 110 mEq/L). In these case reports, relowering was performed because of neurologic symptoms compatible with ODS, and such symptoms resolved after relowering of the serum sodium by 12 to 16 mEq/L over 12 to 14 hours with

         The goal serum sodium is one that represents a rate of correction of less than 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and less than 16 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. Assume, for example, a patient with alcohol use disorder who has an initial serum sodium of 115 mEq/L is corrected to a serum sodium of 127 mEq/L in a period of 16 hours (overly rapid correction).

         Patients with suspected ODS (ie, onset of symptoms consistent with ODS in a patient with risk factors, such as overly rapid correction of hyponatremia) should have their serum sodium relowered; efforts to relower the sodium should commence without waiting for imaging confirmation of demyelinating lesions (which may take weeks to appear). Relowering of the serum sodium is less likely to be of benefit later in the patient's course.

         The optimal approach to the treatment of patients with serum sodium values that have corrected too rapidly and who have developed neurologic manifestations consistent with ODS is unclear. Based upon the ensuing observations of benefit, the absence of other effective therapies, and the poor prognosis associated with ODS, we recommend relowering the serum sodium to a level that is
         <strong>
          just below
         </strong>
         the maximal 48-hour target value (ie, to a value that is less than 16 mEq/L above the initial serum sodium). The 48-hour goal was chosen because patients with ODS typically present two to six days after overly rapid correction. The efficacy and safety of this approach is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
         The regimens used to relower the serum sodium in patients with ODS are the same as those described above to relower the serum sodium in patients who have exceeded correction limits (but who have not yet developed manifestations of ODS). (See

         The potential efficacy of relowering the serum sodium after the onset of neurologic symptoms of ODS was demonstrated in a rat model in which severe hyponatremia of three days' duration was rapidly corrected with hypertonic

         The outcomes were much better among rats treated with relowering the serum sodium with distilled water to a total correction of less than 20 mEq/L at 24 hours; seven survived, and the mean survival time was 7.5 days. The rats that were treated four hours after symptom onset had better outcomes than those that were treated 8 to 10 hours after symptom onset.

        <p>
         A similar outcome was described in another case report in which the serum sodium was raised by 23 mEq/L in the first 48 hours  (

         and D5W was initiated within hours of the onset of neurologic symptoms, and there were substantial reductions in serum sodium (up to 12 mEq/L) within the first 12 hours  (

          72-74
         </a>
         ]. The optimal target serum sodium and rate of relowering in patients with ODS have not been defined. A reasonable approach is to lower the serum sodium to a value that is less than 16 mEq/L above the lowest level when therapy was initiated. As an example, a patient who presented with a serum sodium of 100 mEq/L and who develops symptoms of ODS with a serum sodium of 130 mEq/L should have their sodium level lowered to approximately 115 mEq/L (ie, an increase just below 16 mEq/L, which is the 48-hour limit). The rate of relowering should be approximately 1 mEq/L per hour, and the patient's neurologic status and serum sodium should be carefully monitored as relowering is performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Relowering therapy should be initiated as quickly as possible after the onset of neurologic symptoms that are attributed to ODS. In the rat model described above, initiation of relowering within four hours of symptom onset was associated with better outcomes than initiation within 8 to 10 hours of symptom onset [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         ]. In the case reports in humans, relowering was initiated within a few hours after the onset of neurologic symptoms  (

         Many patients with ODS recover function, at least in part. In some cases, recovery occurs after prolonged periods of severe neurologic impairment. Thus, aggressive supportive therapy should be provided to all patients who were functional prior to the onset of ODS. Since patients with severe ODS frequently develop aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, endotracheal intubation and ventilator support are often required. Recovery from seemingly hopeless neurologic deficits can occur, and therefore, supportive therapy should be continued for at least six to eight weeks before concluding that the deficits are irreversible [

         There have been several reports of complete or partial resolution of neurologic deficits in patients with ODS following various combinations of immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis, and glucocorticoids [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91-93

Immune-modulating therapy is based on the theory that osmotic disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows circulating lymphocytes, cytokines, complement proteins, and vasoactive amines to enter the brain, where they mediate astrocyte and oligodendroglial injury and demyelination. Cytokines secreted from activated microglial cells are also thought to contribute to oligodendrocyte loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although favorable neurologic outcomes suggest a possible benefit from these interventions, they are difficult to interpret since many patients who develop ODS after rapid correction of hyponatremia experience a spontaneous reversal of neurologic impairment. Unlike therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration, immune-modulating therapy has not been studied in experimental models of ODS.

         Brain adaptations that reduce the cerebral edema associated with hyponatremia make the brain vulnerable to injury if there is overly rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia. The neurologic manifestations of this injury have been called the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS; formerly called central pontine myelinolysis or CPM). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         The brain begins to adapt to hypotonicity almost immediately after a fall in serum sodium, and the adaptation is complete within two days  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71152" href="/z/d/graphic/71152.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Because the brain is able to adapt to hypotonicity, hyponatremia that develops over more than two to three days is not associated with severe brain swelling and is therefore much less likely to be complicated by seizures and coma; it is also extremely unlikely to produce brain herniation. However, once the brain has adapted to hypotonicity, the rate of correction of the hyponatremia becomes important. Overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia can lead to ODS. By contrast, rapid correction is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         likely to induce ODS in patients with severe hyponatremia that has only been present for several hours, since the cerebral adaptation is at an early stage. (See

When the initial serum sodium is greater than 120 mEq/L, ODS is rare and typically limited to patients with severe liver disease and patients with arginine vasopressin disorders (formerly diabetes insipidus) who have developed hyponatremia as a complication of

         Duration of hyponatremia – Neurologic deterioration following rapid correction of hyponatremia is unlikely in patients with severe hyponatremia that develops over a few hours. By contrast, patients who develop hyponatremia more gradually have time for the brain adaptation and may develop the ODS after overly rapid correction. The duration of hyponatremia is often not known. Thus, clinicians should assume that the patient has chronic hyponatremia unless the history suggests acute water intoxication. (See
         <a class="local">

         Overly rapid rate of correction – It is difficult to define a threshold rate of correction below which ODS will not occur. Occasional cases have been reported in which ODS has developed after correction by as little as 8 mEq/L per day or 16 mEq/L in 48 hours. We and other authors recommend that the rate of correction of hyponatremia should not exceed 6 to 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period. This is not a goal of therapy, but rather a therapeutic limit that should not be exceeded. (See

         The clinical manifestations of ODS are typically
         <strong>
          delayed
         </strong>
         for two to six days after overly rapid elevation of the serum sodium concentration has occurred  (

         ). The symptoms, which are often irreversible or only partially reversible, include dysarthria, dysphagia, paraparesis or quadriparesis, behavioral disturbances, movement disorders, seizures, lethargy, confusion, disorientation, obtundation, and coma. Severely affected patients may become "locked in"; they are awake but are unable to move or verbally communicate. Other common findings include increased muscle tone and facial weakness, as well as snout, grasp, or rooting reflexes. (See

         ODS should be suspected in all patients who have risk factors for the disorder and consistent clinical manifestations. ODS is likely to be present if overly rapid correction of hyponatremia has occurred during the previous week. Patients suspected of having ODS should undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or, if MRI is unavailable, computed tomography (CT) scanning of the brain. (See

         Among patients at heightened risk of ODS because of alcohol use disorder, severe malnutrition, or advanced liver disease, or in those with severe hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium &lt;120 mEq/L) lasting more than two to three days (or if the duration is unknown), we recommend that the serum sodium be raised by less than 6 to 8 mEq/L in any 24-hour period to prevent ODS (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). When correcting the serum sodium in patients with hyponatremia, careful monitoring of the serum sodium concentration (initially, every two to three hours) is essential to avoid overly rapid correction in patients at increased risk for ODS. The urine volume should also be monitored for the emergence of a water diuresis. (See

         Some patients, during the course of treatment of hyponatremia, require further therapy to prevent overly rapid correction or to relower the serum sodium if overly rapid correction occurs. Such patients, and the corresponding therapeutic strategies, include:

         "Proactive strategy" in patients who are likely to develop overly rapid correction – If the cause of impaired water excretion is likely to be reversible (eg, in hypovolemic patients), a water diuresis may develop and cause an abrupt rise in the serum sodium. In these patients, urinary water losses and rapid correction of hyponatremia can be prevented by administering
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9330" href="/z/d/drug information/9330.html" rel="external">
          desmopressin
         </a>
         at the outset of treatment. We use the proactive strategy in patients with reversible causes of hyponatremia whose pretreatment serum sodium concentration is &lt;120 mEq/L or whose risk of ODS is enhanced because of alcohol use disorder, severe malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. We also use the proactive regimen to treat desmopressin-induced hyponatremia in patients with arginine vasopressin disorders, even at serum sodium concentrations &gt;120 mEq/L. (See
