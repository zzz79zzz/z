         Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a heterogeneous group of conditions involving permanent motor dysfunction that affects muscle tone, posture, and/or movement. These conditions are due to abnormalities of the developing fetal or infant brain resulting from a variety of nonprogressive causes. Although the disorder itself is not neurodegenerative, the clinical expression may change over time as the central nervous system matures. The motor impairment results in limitations in functional abilities and activity, which can vary in severity. Multiple additional symptoms often accompany the primary motor abnormalities, including altered sensation or perception, intellectual disability, communication and behavioral difficulties, seizures, and musculoskeletal complications [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The evaluation and diagnosis of CP are discussed here. The epidemiology, etiologies, classification, clinical features, management, and prevention of CP are discussed separately:

         </span>
         The diagnosis of CP is made clinically in children with permanent, nonprogressive motor dysfunction due to abnormalities in the developing brain. A diagnostic assessment of CP incorporates pre- and postnatal history, physical examination (muscle tone, posture, coordination, upper motor neuron signs), and ancillary testing (imaging, laboratory studies). There is no single test that confirms or excludes CP.
        </p>
        <p>
         A definitive diagnosis of CP generally requires serial examinations. Key features in the diagnosis of CP include the following [

         The diagnosis should not be based upon an isolated abnormality. Infants with mild hypertonia or hyperreflexia who otherwise have normal functional development should be observed. If the abnormality remains isolated, it will resolve in most cases after the child reaches nine months of age.

         For infants and children with risk factors for CP and/or evidence on examination of impairment in motor functioning, we perform a comprehensive clinical and diagnostic evaluation. Serial examinations are used to confirm initial findings and identify any new features. Diagnostic testing is performed to identify the underlying cause and to exclude alternative etiologies  (

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         We suggest screening for CP as soon as risk factors or clinical findings are identified, in agreement with international consensus statements [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Clues to an early diagnosis include abnormal behavior (eg, excessive docility or irritability), abnormal tone, abnormal posture, persistence of primitive reflexes, and failure to achieve motor milestones  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef102836" href="/z/d/graphic/102836.html" rel="external">
          table 1A
         </a>
         ). Early signs of CP differ somewhat based upon the CP subtype  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533" href="/z/d/graphic/74533.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). In many cases, spasticity may not be identified until six months of age. Dyskinetic patterns are often not apparent until approximately 18 months. Ataxia may not become obvious until even later. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6167.html" rel="external">
          "Cerebral palsy: Classification and clinical features", section on 'Early signs of cerebral palsy'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although historical precedent has been to make a CP diagnosis between 12 and 24 months, the diagnosis can be made at even &lt;6 months of age in children with neonatal risk factors, suggestive brain imaging, and suggestive features on a standardized neurologic examination [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Early diagnosis is often critical for establishing access to targeted therapy services, which are often most effective when instituted early [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The provision of an early diagnosis can be a disease-modifying intervention for some children and their families. Families often suspect a CP diagnosis long before it is given, and some studies report they wish that a CP diagnosis was provided sooner [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to reconfirm the CP diagnosis as the child ages, particularly with early CP diagnosis. There are certain motor phenotypic, imaging, and history features that make it more likely for a child to have a progressive or neurodegenerative CP "mimic" as opposed to a true CP diagnosis, even if the child meets criteria for a CP diagnosis early in life [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Findings suggesting an alternative diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The specific CP subtypes are best recognized after five years of age  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533" href="/z/d/graphic/74533.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The clinical features of these syndromes are discussed in more detail separately. (See

         While the diagnosis of CP is made clinically and no specific test confirms or excludes the diagnosis of CP, a diagnostic evaluation should be performed in all children with CP to identify the underlying cause of CP when possible and to exclude other conditions. We obtain neuroimaging for all patients and perform laboratory testing based on clinical and historic features  (

         We suggest neuroimaging for all patients with suspected CP to help identify underlying etiology and exclude alternative conditions. Repeat imaging may be warranted for infants and children when neuroimaging performed in the neonatal period did not establish an etiology. MRI without contrast is preferred over computed tomography (CT) because it generally has a higher diagnostic yield in determining the etiology and does not expose the patient to radiation.

         Cranial ultrasound is a neuroimaging modality that is typically performed in neonates and young infants who have an open anterior fontanel. Some patients presenting for evaluation of suspected CP may be beyond the age where this study can be performed. However, review of prior cranial ultrasounds performed in early infancy (eg, during a NICU stay) can provide helpful information. Ultrasonography can identify hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and hydrocephalus, but it is not sensitive for white matter injury. For most children with suspected CP, abnormal findings on a cranial ultrasound should generally be followed up with brain MRI for better characterization.

Patients who fail to maintain weight-for-age growth trajectories and those with weights below the threshold for their GMFCS should undergo a nutritional evaluation, including assessment of caloric intake and exploration of alternative explanations for low body weight, such as growth hormone deficiency or familial short stature. If undernutrition is confirmed, concerted efforts should be made to boost nutrition through oral supplements or enteral feeds with the guidance of a dietician who has expertise in children with CP.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of CP is made clinically in children with permanent, nonprogressive motor dysfunction due to abnormalities in the developing brain. A diagnostic assessment of CP incorporates pre- and postnatal history, physical examination (muscle tone, posture, coordination, upper motor neuron signs), and ancillary testing (imaging, laboratory studies). There is no test that confirms or excludes CP. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For infants and children with risk factors for CP and/or evidence on examination of impairment in motor functioning, we perform a comprehensive clinical and diagnostic evaluation. Serial examinations are used to confirm initial findings and identify any new features. Diagnostic testing is performed to identify the underlying cause and to exclude alternative etiologies  (

          Clinical assessment
         </strong>
         – Early diagnosis of CP begins with a detailed birth and family history to identify risk factors for CP  (

         <strong>
          Neuroimaging
         </strong>
         – We suggest neuroimaging for all patients with suspected CP to help identify underlying etiology and exclude alternative conditions. Repeat imaging may be warranted for infants and children when neuroimaging performed in the neonatal period did not establish an etiology. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Metabolic and genetic testing
         </strong>
         – We suggest laboratory testing for infants and children with suspected CP when clinical assessment is suggestive of an underlying infectious, metabolic, or genetic etiology  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76743" href="/z/d/graphic/76743.html" rel="external">

          table 5
         </a>
         ). In addition, laboratory testing is warranted when neuroimaging evaluation is suggestive of a specific underlying condition (eg, genetic testing for microdeletion syndromes may be warranted when brain MRI shows lissencephaly) or is nondiagnostic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Metabolic and genetic testing'

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Typical symptoms and signs of CP (eg, early hypotonia, spasticity, and dystonia and/or choreoathetosis) may be present in other conditions. These include neurodegenerative diseases, conditions associated with inborn errors of metabolism, developmental or traumatic lesions of the brain or spinal cord, neuromuscular or movement disorders, and neoplasm. Neuroimaging, laboratory studies, and the clinical course distinguish these conditions from CP. (See

         <strong>
          Associated conditions
         </strong>
         – Children with CP should be evaluated for other conditions that may occur with CP. These include learning disorders and intellectual disability, behavioral and psychiatric conditions, epilepsy, visual impairment, speech and/or language impairment, hearing impairment, nutrition and growth issues, gastrointestinal disorders, pulmonary disease, orthopedic disorders, sleep disorders, and urinary control disorders.
