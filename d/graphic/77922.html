<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Homesickness is normal. Almost all children feel a bit sad and nervous when they are separated from home and loved ones. No matter how turbulent your child's life has been lately, he or she is likely to miss many things about home during this hospitalization. One way that parents can help children deal with this distress is to reassure them that missing home is normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Talk with your child honestly about when and why he or she is being hospitalized. Although the honest truth may be upsetting or surprising to some children, coping with the reality of their situation now prevents uncomfortable surprises later. Children who feel "tricked" into hospitalization lose confidence in the reliability of their caregivers and therapists, which increases homesickness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. To help your child feel "at home" in the hospital, the staff may give your child a tour of the unit. Staff members can explain the daily routine on the unit and answer any questions that you or your child might have. This orientation, along with photographs, calendars, schedules, and introductions to other children, will help your child feel more comfortable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Although you may have some mixed feelings about your child's hospitalization, try not to convey those feelings to your child. If you talk about your mixed feelings, you may increase your child's own doubts about the value of hospitalization. Instead, give your child a consistent, positive message about why he or she is here. Help your child understand the value of this hospital stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Often, it is impossible for staff to predict your child's exact discharge date. This date depends on many factors, some of which are constantly changing. Although this uncertainty is hard for families, it is even harder when an exact date does not work out as planned. The disappointment of a postponed discharge date can make children quite homesick. Therefore, instead of focusing on a particular date, ask the staff to estimate a range of dates, and be honest with your child that no one knows the exact discharge date yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. Sometimes, children in the hospital get confused about time. Your child might even forget when you visited the last time or when you said you would come back for a visit. This confusion can make homesickness worse. To help your child keep track of your visits, draw or buy a simple calendar and write your plans down. Try your best to be on time for the visits and telephone calls that you plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. Frequent visits and telephone calls help ease children's homesickness. Of course, you have other commitments, but try to visit as often as possible. Avoid canceling visits at the last moment, which is particularly upsetting to children. If you cannot visit, be sure to call and talk with your child on the telephone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="sublist1_start">8. Despite all of your efforts and all of the staff's efforts to make children feel comfortable, many of them still feel homesick in the hospital. Fortunately, many children can help themselves feel better by doing one of the things below. You and the hospital staff should share these techniques with your child:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="sublist1">a. Do a fun activity to forget about missing home. Play a game with a friend, watch television, listen to music, or read a book.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="sublist1">b. Do something to feel closer to home. Write a letter, talk on the telephone, or look at a family picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="sublist1">c. Think about the good side of being in the hospital. There are kids to play with and staff to help you. Being in the hospital will help you get better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="sublist1">d. Keep a positive attitude. Staff members can answer your questions and teach you a lot about dealing with your problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="sublist1">e. Remind yourself that you will be home soon. Hospitalizations do not last forever. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="sublist1">f. Talk with someone who can make you feel better, such as your doctor or one of the other staff members.</td>
</tr>
