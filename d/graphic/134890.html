Specifically, there is no evidence that younger low-risk stage II patients should be offered ACT on the basis of their age alone.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"><strong>Recommendation 1.3.</strong> ACT should be offered to patients with stage IIB and stage IIC colon cancer (ie, T4, lesions either penetrating visceral peritoneum or invasive of surrounding organ, respectively), with a discussion of the potential benefits and risks of harm associated with ACT (type: evidence-based; benefits may outweigh harms; evidence quality: moderate; strength of recommendation: weak).</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p><strong>Recommendation 1.4.</strong> ACT may be offered to patients with stage IIA (ie, T3) colon cancer with high-risk features, including sampling of fewer than 12 lymph nodes in the surgical specimen, perineural or lymphovascular invasion, poorly or undifferentiated tumor grade, intestinal obstruction, tumor perforation, and/or grade BD3 tumor budding (â‰¥10 buds) (type: evidence-based; benefits may outweigh harms; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak).</p> Qualifying statements: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>The number of risk factors should be considered as part of the shared decision-making process. The presence of more than one risk factor may increase the risk of recurrence; in an exploratory analysis of International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration data, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 74.8% for stage II patients with two or more risk factors, compared with 87.3% for patients with one risk factor.</li> <li>Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was identified as an emerging potential predictive factor; however, insufficient evidence of predictive value of chemotherapy was available to warrant its inclusion in the list of high-risk features within the main recommendation. The Expert Panel anticipates that data on ctDNA will be forthcoming through prospective clinical trials and included in a future version of this guideline.</li> <li>The Expert Panel notes that there is controversy around the timing of chemotherapy; data on this topic were not reported in the included observational studies. In the MOSAIC trial of oxaliplatin in addition to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, patients were required to have started ACT within 7 weeks of surgery. In the QUASAR trial of ACT with fluorouracil and folinic acid, therapy was initiated within 6 weeks of surgery, where possible.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p><strong>Recommendation 2.1.</strong> Adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-only chemotherapy is not routinely recommended for patients with exhibit mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or high microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors (type: evidence-based; harms outweigh benefits; evidence quality: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong).</p> Qualifying statements: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>For patients with dMMR or MSI and T4 tumors and/or other high-risk features (with the exception of poor differentiation), oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy may be considered (refer to Recommendation 3.1, qualifying statements). This qualifying statement is based on indirect evidence of a DFS benefit with the addition of oxaliplatin in the population of patients with stage II or stage III colon cancer in the MOSAIC trial.</li> <li>Poor differentiation is not considered a high-risk prognostic factor in patients with dMMR or MSI tumors.</li> <li>Patients with proficient mismatch repair/microsatellite stable (pMMR or MSS) tumors are included within guideline Recommendations 1.1-1.4.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p><strong>Recommendation 3.1.</strong> There is insufficient evidence to routinely recommend the addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for patients with high-risk stage II colon cancer (type: evidence-based; benefits may outweigh harms; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak).</p> Qualifying statements: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>The Expert Panel notes the significant time to recurrence (TTR) benefit with oxaliplatin-containing ACT in exploratory analyses of the MOSAIC trial. The Panel recommends a shared decision-making approach to guide the choice of therapy that includes discussion of potential for benefit and risks of harm with the addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.</li> <li>As stated in the qualifying statement to Recommendation 2.1, for patients with dMMR or MSI who have T4 tumors and/or other high-risk features (with the exception of poor differentiation), when shared decision-making results in the choice to proceed with ACT, the Expert Panel recommends oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy. This statement is based on indirect evidence of benefit in the combined population of patients with stage II and III colon cancer.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p><strong>Recommendation 4.1.</strong> In patients who are candidates for adjuvant doublet chemotherapy, adjuvant oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy may be offered for a duration of 3 or 6 months, after a discussion with the patient of the potential benefits and risks of harm associated with the options for treatment duration (type: evidence-based; benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: moderate; strength of recommendation: weak).</p> NOTE: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>Recommendation 4.1 is based on a subgroup analysis of four randomized trials from the IDEA collaboration. The choice of therapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) or fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) was non-randomized and made by treating clinicians before random assignment to 3 or 6 months duration of treatment. In high-risk stage II patients, 5-year DFS, the primary study outcome, was 81.7% versus 82.0% (p = 0.09) with 3 versus 6 months of CAPOX, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 80% CI, 0.88 to 1.17). The 5-year DFS was 79.2% versus 86.5% (p = 0.88) with 3 versus 6 months of FOLFOX, respectively (HR, 1.41; 80% CI, 1.18 to 1.68). Among all patients, the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher during treatment was 13% versus 36% with 3 months versus 6 months of treatment, respectively. These findings should be considered during the shared decision-making process.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.</strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><div class="graphic_reference">From: Baxter NN, Kennedy EB, Bergsland E, et al.
