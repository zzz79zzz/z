Special attention should be given to the emergence of a different monoclonal protein following treatment, especially in the setting of patients having achieved a conventional complete response, often related to oligoclonal reconstitution of the immune system. These bands typically disappear over time and in some studies have been associated with a better outcome. Also, appearance of monoclonal IgG κ in patients receiving monoclonal antibodies should be differentiated from the therapeutic antibody.</div><div class="graphic_footnotes">IMWG: International Myeloma Working Group; MRD: minimal residual disease; NGF: next-generation flow; NGS: next-generation sequencing; PET: positron emission tomography; CT: computed tomography; SUV: standardized uptake value; FLC: free light chain; M-protein: myeloma protein; SPD: sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions; CRAB features: calcium elevation, renal failure, anemia, lytic bone lesions; FCM: flow cytometry; SUV<sub>max</sub>: maximum standardized uptake value; MFC: multiparameter flow cytometry; <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET: <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; ASCT: autologous stem cell transplantation.<br/>* All response categories require two consecutive assessments made any time before starting any new therapy; for MRD there is no need for two consecutive assessments, but information on MRD after each treatment stage is recommended (eg, after induction, high-dose therapy/ASCT, consolidation, maintenance). MRD tests should be initiated only at the time of suspected complete response. All categories of response and MRD require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements except for the requirement of FDG PET if imaging MRD-negative status is reported.<br/>¶ Sustained MRD negativity when reported should also annotate the method used (eg, sustained flow MRD-negative, sustained sequencing MRD-negative).<br/>Δ Bone marrow MFC should follow NGF guidelines.<sup>[1]</sup> The reference NGF method is an eight-color two-tube approach, which has been extensively validated. The two-tube approach improves reliability, consistency, and sensitivity because of the acquisition of a greater number of cells. The eight-color technology is widely available globally and the NGF method has already been adopted in many flow laboratories worldwide. The complete eight-color method is most efficient using a lyophilized mixture of antibodies which reduces errors, time, and costs. 5 million cells should be assessed. The FCM method employed should have a sensitivity of detection of at least 1 in 10<sup>5</sup> plasma cells.<br/><span class="lozenge">◊</span> DNA sequencing assay on bone marrow aspirate should use a validated assay such as LymphoSIGHT (Sequenta).<br/>§ Criteria used by Zamagni and colleagues,<sup>[2]</sup> and expert panel (Italian Myeloma criteria for PET Use [IMPetUs]).<sup>[3,4]</sup> Baseline positive lesions were identified by presence of focal areas of increased uptake within bones, with or without any underlying lesion identified by CT and present on at least two consecutive slices. Alternatively, an SUV<sub>max</sub> = 2.5 within osteolytic CT areas &gt;1 cm in size, or SUV<sub>max</sub> = 1.5 within osteolytic CT areas ≤1 cm in size were considered positive. Imaging should be performed once MRD negativity is determined by MFC or NGS.<br/>¥ Derived from international uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma.<sup>[5]</sup> Minor response definition and clarifications derived from Rajkumar and colleagues.<sup>[6]</sup> When the only method to measure disease is by serum FLC levels: Complete response can be defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in addition to the complete response criteria listed previously. Very good partial response in such patients requires a ≥90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. All response categories require two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions or extramedullary plasmacytomas if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow assessments do not need to be confirmed. Each category, except for stable disease, will be considered unconfirmed until the confirmatory test is performed. The date of the initial test is considered as the date of response for evaluation of time dependent outcomes such as duration of response.<br/>‡ All recommendations regarding clinical uses relating to serum FLC levels or FLC ratio are based on results obtained with the validated Freelite test (Binding Site, Birmingham, UK).<br/>† Presence/absence of clonal cells on immunohistochemistry is based upon the κ/λ/L ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio by immunohistochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of &gt;4:1 or &lt;1:2.<br/>** Plasmacytoma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or dedicated CT scans where applicable. For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size will be determined by the SPD.<br/>¶¶ Positive immunofixation alone in a patient previously classified as achieving a complete response will not be considered progression. For purposes of calculating time to progression and progression-free survival, patients who have achieved a complete response and are MRD-negative should be evaluated using criteria listed for progressive disease. Criteria for relapse from a complete response or relapse from MRD should be used only when calculating disease-free survival.<br/>ΔΔ In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (eg, a possible laboratory error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.</div><div class="graphic_reference">References:
