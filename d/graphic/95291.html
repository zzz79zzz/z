Everyone's timing is different. The person coming out should decide when is best.</td> </tr> <tr class="divider_bottom"> <td>Consider coming out when you: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>Are comfortable with your sexual interests, identity, and orientation </li> <li>Want to share this with persons that you trust and are close to you </li> <li>Have had a chance to gather information or talk to others to learn from their coming out experiences </li> <li>Have a plan for support – where could you live, get money for food and clothes, go to school, and work if you are not accepted in your home and need to live elsewhere? </li> <li>Are ready to </li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="divider_bottom" rowspan="2"><strong>Who?</strong></td> <td>You don't have to tell everyone at the same time. Parents and family may be a strong source of support but also may respond differently than you expect. Sometimes telling a close and trusted friend or professional (eg, teacher, coach, counselor) can be easier and safer the first time you tell someone about your sexuality.</td> </tr> <tr class="divider_bottom"> <td>Choose a person or persons who you: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>Know well and expect to be respectful and supportive </li> <li>Trust, feel safe with, and know will keep your information confidential if you ask them to </li> <li>If you are thinking about telling a friend, choose carefully; some may have trouble keeping your information safe and confidential </li> <li>If you are thinking about disclosing to a school staff member, it is important to know whether or not your school's privacy and confidentiality policy requires staff to reveal that information to your parents </li> <li>Be sure to tell the person or persons you tell, who else may be told and who should <strong>not</strong> be told </li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="divider_bottom" rowspan="7"><strong>How?</strong></td> <td><strong>Planning</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1 divider_bottom">Planning for your disclosure can help to make it a more positive and safe experience. Preparation may include: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>Talking to other sexual minoritized youth or sexual minoritized adults who have already come out to family and friends; listening and learning from others may provide useful strategies and help you feel confident about when and how to come out </li> <li>Participating in LGBTQ youth groups, support groups, or school groups that can offer advice on coming out </li> <li>Accessing internet resources that relate other youths' coming out experiences </li> <li>Creating a support network before you come out; professionals (eg, health care providers, mental health professionals, counselors) who work with children and teens may be able to help with this </li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Process</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"><strong>Disclosing in a letter</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent2">Writing a letter gives you time to carefully say what you mean to say. Reading a letter in private gives the other person time to consider how they feel and how they might respond to you.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"><strong>Disclosing in person</strong></td> </tr> <tr class="divider_bottom"> <td class="indent2">Some things to keep in mind if you decide to disclose in person: <ul class="decimal_heading"> <li>Try to choose a quiet and private space where you can talk with one or two people at a time. </li> <li>If you have concerns about your parents' reaction (or the reaction of whoever you are telling), try to choose a quiet but public place with other persons around and available to help if needed. </li> <li>Disclose when you and the other person are well rested, not dealing with other active stressors, and have time to continue talking. </li> <li>Focus on a few issues that are most important to you. Actively listen to what is important to the other person as well. </li> <li>Plan how you might want to end the conversation and how you might plan to talk about it later. </li> <li>Avoid using alcohol or drugs; your mental and emotional state should be stable and secure when you have this important conversation. </li> <li>Try to avoid coming out because of pressure from others, being angry, or fighting. </li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="6"><strong>Safety</strong></td> <td><strong>Be prepared for the possibility of a negative or rejecting reaction.</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Safety first and foremost.</strong> Plan how to keep yourself physically safe at the time of disclosure and afterward. This may be difficult, but it is important to figure out ahead of time where you would go if the disclosure is difficult or threatening.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Emotional safety is important, too. If you think you may be disclosing to a person who will be negative or rejecting, have your support network ready to help you process the negative reaction.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Some people's first reaction may be more negative than you anticipate. The negative response may be based on the initial shock, surprise, or discomfort. They may need time to process the disclosure. People with negative initial reactions may still accept and support you but have a hard time processing their own feelings.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Strong negative reactions may reflect personal biases or a background and culture that discriminate against sexual minorities. Issues of religion, morality, and culture have a large impact on how people view sexual diversity. However, there are many social and religious institutions that support civil and social rights of individuals regardless of sexuality or orientation.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>You get to decide if and when to walk away from people who are negative, unsupportive, or harmful.</td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><div class="graphic_footnotes">LGBTQ: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning.</div><div class="graphic_reference">Courtesy of Michelle Forcier, MD, MPH and Johanna Olson-Kennedy, MD.</div><div id="graphicVersion">Graphic 95291 Version 3.0</div></div></div>
