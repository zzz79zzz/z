<p>* These are examples of optimal goals. Actual goals for counseling depend on the child's age, degree of obesity, and current habits and other considerations including family finances and local resources. In most cases, more stringent goals should be set as counseling progresses. Goals need not be absolute: For example, high-calorie snack foods should ideally be eliminated from the house but might be permitted occasionally as a "treat." Refer also to UpToDate content and tables on tips for maintaining a healthy weight.</p>
¶ The "balanced plate" approach gives approximately 1/4 of the meal plate to each of 4 food groups: vegetables, grains, fruits, and protein. This is a way to teach and encourage ample intake of vegetables, fruits, and fiber and may help to subtly limit portion size. Guidance is available at the <a href="https://www.myplate.gov/" target="_blank">MyPlate</a> website.</div><div class="graphic_reference">References:
