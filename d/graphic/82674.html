Similarly, the diagnoses of Panic Disorder and Other Anxiety Disorder require ruling out a physical disorder, medication, or other drug as the biological cause of the anxiety symptoms. Criteria for diagnostic judgments for summarizing responses are located at different points, beginning with "FOR OFFICE CODING", in small type.
