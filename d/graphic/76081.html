Is the child learning successfully now or still struggling?</td> <td>Persistent learning problems over time are more highly associated with LD than a learning problem of recent onset; LD can first manifest at any time throughout the primary and elementary school years but usually manifests in the primary school years</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">What helps the child learn more successfully (eg, small group instruction; 1:1 instruction, etc)?</td> <td>Greater success in small groups as opposed to the general classroom may be related to LD or may be related to other factors such as a language disorder or weak executive skills</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_left" colspan="2">School performance</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">What are the child's grades?</td> <td>Past or current poor academic achievement is a risk factor for LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Can the child complete homework independently?</td> <td>Inability to complete homework independently, especially after grade one, can indicate LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Did the child receive any early intervention or special education services?</td> <td>Past early intervention or special education services are a risk factor for LD, regardless of the type of service that was offered and regardless of whether the child was found to be no longer eligible for services</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Did the child's teachers provide any indication that they were concerned about the child's educational progress?</td> <td>Although not all teachers can identify LD specifically, teacher observations of learning failure is a sensitive indicator of LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Past grade retention</td> <td>Past grade retention is a risk factor for LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_left" colspan="2">School attendance</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Does the child attend school regularly, now and in the past?</td> <td>Past school absences have an impact upon learning success and can mimic LD or be due to LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Does the child have a history of school avoidance?</td> <td>School avoidance may be due to perceived lack of competence because of LD and may also lead to school absences, aggravating learning problems</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_left" colspan="2">Current psychiatric or behavioral conditions</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle3_left" colspan="2">Mental health conditions often occur with LD and are a risk factor for LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Ability to focus and sustain attention to complete tasks of the daily routine;

other symptoms of anxiety</td> <td>Symptoms of anxiety are a risk factor for LD, either as a co-occurring condition or as a result of LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Capacity for managing frustration (waiting his/her turn in a game; capacity to self-soothe when angry)</td> <td>Symptoms of difficulty regulating anger are a risk factor for behavior disorders, which co-occur with LD; low frustration tolerance for school activities specifically is a risk factor for LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_left" colspan="2">Medical history</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Prenatal health problems;

poor adaptive function may be associated with learning failure and with LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Attainment of social and play skills (ability to play successfully with same-age peers without caregiver supervision; capacity for friendships)</td> <td>Social skills may be delayed as a primary problem (eg, autism spectrum disorder) or may be due to perceived lack of self-confidence due to LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Able to participate in community activities such as sports teams or other recreational activities</td> <td>Motor, adaptive, and social skills are required for success in community activities; LD is associated with lower success in these areas</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_left" colspan="2">Family history</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Do any first- or second-degree relatives have learning problems?</td> <td>LD is often inherited</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Do any first- or second-degree relatives have mental health or developmental conditions such as anxiety, depression, attention problems, learning problems, etc?</td> <td>Mental health conditions often occur with LD and are a risk factor for LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">What are the parents'/caregivers' or family's current reading habits?</td> <td>The history of current reading habits can serve as a proxy for an unidentified reading disability</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">How far did the parents/caregivers take their education?</td> <td>Poor educational achievement is related to LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_left" colspan="2">Social history</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Current parent employment status</td> <td>Current parental employment status may be related to the parents' success at school and maybe an indicator of LD</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Past abuse or neglect</td> <td>Past abuse or neglect is a risk factor for poor educational achievement in general and may be related to LD, regardless of current social status</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Past or current homelessness</td> <td>Past homelessness is a risk factor for poor educational achievement in general and may be related to LD, regardless of current living circumstances</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Past or current parental/caregiver illnesses in family members</td> <td>Past illnesses in the family is a risk factor for poor educational achievement, for both social and heritable reasons</td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><div class="graphic_lgnd">This table is derived from UpToDate content on specific learning disorders. Refer to UpToDate content for additional details. Poor educational achievement may occur because of LD, weak language skills, weak executive skills, or lower overall cognitive potential. The risk factors identified in the table are associated with learning difficulty and support the request for an evaluation for LD or other causes of learning failure. The timing of the evaluation is an important consideration because some types of learning difficulty can only be identified after exposure to education.</div><div class="graphic_footnotes">LD: learning disorder; CNS: central nervous system.</div><div id="graphicVersion">Graphic 76081 Version 11.0</div></div></div>
