A quality improvement program should routinely 1) review quality and outcomes of the entire program; 2) review results of individual operators; 3) include risk adjustment; 4) provide peer review of difficult or complicated cases; and 5) perform random case reviews. The review process should assess the appropriateness of the interventional procedures.
