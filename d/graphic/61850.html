<div class="graphic"><div class="figure"><div class="ttl">Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy handout</div><div class="cntnt"><table cellspacing="0"><tbody> <tr> <td class="subtitle1_single">What you can expect in joining this group</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(Please read this handout before we meet)</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_single">Depression</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Depression is a common problem. Twenty percent of adults become severely depressed at some point in their lives. Depression involves both biologic changes in the way the brain works and psychological changes in the way one thinks and feels. Thus, it is often useful to treat depression by combining medical treatments (that act on the brain) with psychological approaches (that teach new ways to deal with thoughts and feelings).</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_single">Treatment of depression</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p>When you have been depressed in the past, your doctor may have prescribed antidepressant medication. This works through changes in the chemical messengers in your brain. In depression, these chemical messengers have often become abnormal, lowering mood and energy levels, and disturbing sleep and appetite. Correcting these brain chemicals may have taken time, but many people improve after six to eight weeks.</p> <p>Although antidepressants generally work well in reducing depression, they are not a permanent cure; their effects continue only so long as you keep taking the pills. Your doctor can continue to prescribe antidepressants for months or years, and this is now recommended for patients if further depression is to be prevented with medication.</p> However, many people prefer to use other ways to prevent further depression. This is the purpose of the classes for learning mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_single">Delaying or preventing more depression</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p>Whatever caused your depression in the first place, the experience of depression has a number of after-effects. Once you have been depressed, you are likely to become depressed again. The purpose of these classes is to improve your chance of preventing further depression. In the classes, you will learn skills that will help you to handle your thoughts and feelings differently.</p> <p>Since many people have had depression and are at risk for further depression, you will learn these skills in a class with up to a dozen other people who have also been depressed and treated with antidepressants. In eight two-hour sessions, the class will meet to learn new ways of dealing with what goes on in our minds, and to share and review experiences with other class members.</p> After the eight weekly sessions are over, the class will meet again four times over the following few months for reunions and to see how things are progressing.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_single">Homework: The importance of practice in between classes</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p>We will work together to change the patterns of mind that have often been around for a long time. These patterns may have become a habit. We can only expect to succeed in making changes if we put time and effort into learning new skills.</p> This approach depends entirely on your willingness to practice your skills at home in between class meetings. This homework will take at least an hour a day, six days a week, for eight weeks, and involves tasks such as listening to CDs, performing brief exercises, and other activities. We appreciate that it is often difficult to carve out that amount of time for something new in lives that are already busy and crowded. However, the commitment to spend time on home practice is an essential part of the class; if you do not feel able to make that commitment, it would be best not to start the classes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_single">Facing difficulties</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p>The classes and home practice assignments can teach you how to be more fully aware and present in each moment of life. The good news is that this makes life more interesting, vivid, and fulfilling. On the other hand, this means facing what is present, even when it is unpleasant and difficult. In practice, you will find that facing and acknowledging difficulties is the most effective way to reduce unhappiness in the long run. It is also central to delaying or preventing further depression. Seeing unpleasant feelings, thoughts, or experiences clearly as they arise means that you will be in better shape to "nip them in the bud," before they progress to more intense or persistent depressions.</p> In the classes, you will learn gentle ways to face difficulties, and will be supported by the instructor and the other class members.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_single">Patience and persistence</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1"> <p>Because we will be working to change well-established habits of mind, it will mean putting in a lot of time and effort. The effects of this effort may only become apparent later. In many ways, this is much like gardening—we have to prepare the ground, plant the seeds, ensure that they are adequately watered and nourished, and then wait patiently for results.</p> <p>You may be familiar with this pattern from your treatment with antidepressants—often there is little benefit until you have been taking the medication for some time. Yet improvement in your depression depended on you continuing to take the antidepressant even when you felt no immediate benefit.</p> In the same way, we ask you to approach the classes and home practice with a spirit of patience and persistence, committing yourself to put time and effort into what will be asked of you, while accepting that the fruits of your efforts may take some time.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="subtitle2_single">The initial individual meeting</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Your initial individual meeting provides an opportunity to ask questions about the classes, or to discuss issues related to the points raised in this handout. You may find it useful, before you come for that interview, to make a note of the points that you wish to raise.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="indent1">Good luck!</td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><div class="graphic_reference">From: Segal ZV, Williams JMG, Teasdale JD.
