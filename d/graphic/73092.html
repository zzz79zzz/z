These guidelines are not absolutes, however, and their application requires physician judgment.</div><div class="graphic_footnotes">bpm: beats per minute.<br/>* This level of care is most effective if administered for at least 8 hours/day, 5 days/week; less intensive care is demonstrably less effective.<br/>¶ If the patient is dehydrated, whole-body potassium values may be low even if the serum potassium value is in the normal range; determine concurrent urine specific gravity to assess dehydration.<br/>Δ Determining suicide risk is a complex clinical judgment, as is determining the most appropriate treatment setting for patients at risk for suicide. Relevant factors to consider are the patient's concurrent medical conditions, psychosis, substance abuse, other psychiatric symptoms or syndromes, psychosocial supports, past suicidal behaviors, and treatment adherence and the quality of existing physician-patient relationships. These factors are described in greater detail in the American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guideline for the Assessment and Treatment of Patients With Suicidal Behaviors.<br/><font class="lozenge">◊</font> Although this table lists percentages of expected healthy body weight in relation to suggested levels of care, these are only approximations and do not correspond to percentages based on standardized values for the population as a whole. For any given individual, differences in body build, body composition, and other physiological variables may result in considerable differences as to what constitutes a healthy body weight in relation to "norms." For example, for some patients, a healthy body weight may be 110% of the standardized value for the population, whereas for other individuals it may be 98%. Each individual's physiological differences must be assessed and appreciated. For children, also consider the rate of weight loss. Finally, weight level per se should never be used as the sole criterion for discharge from inpatient care. Many patients require inpatient admission at higher weights and should not be automatically discharged just because they have achieved a certain weight level unless all other factors are appropriately considered. Refer to UpToDate text for further discussion regarding weight.<br/>§ Some experts suggest &gt;85% rather than &gt;80%.<br/>¥ Individuals may experience these thoughts as consistent with their own deeply held beliefs (in which case they seem to be ego-syntonic and "overvalued") or as unwanted and ego-alien repetitive thoughts, consistent with classic obsessive-compulsive disorder phenomenology.</div><div class="graphic_reference">Reproduced with permission, and adapted, from Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders, Third Edition.
